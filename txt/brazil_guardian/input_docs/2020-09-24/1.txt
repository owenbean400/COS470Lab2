Brazilian champions Flamengo have asked league organisers to cancel this weekend ’s game against Palmeiras after 16 of their players tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Seven players tested positive ahead of Tuesday ’s Copa Libertadores match against Barcelona in Ecuador and several others , plus their coach and doctor , came down with the virus on their return . 
" This is an exceptional situation , " Rodrigo Dunshee , the club ’s vice president for legal issues , said . 
It is very important to kill this at the root . 
We ca not pass this on to other teams who will pass it on to other teams . 
The correct measure is to delay this game . 
It seems we have just nine players and three goalkeepers . 
The Brazilian Football Confederation has so far denied the request , saying the Rio de Janeiro club have a big enough squad to handle the withdrawals . 
The Sao Paulo Players ’ Union said it supports Flamengo ’s call and called the CBF ’s refusal " irresponsible " . 
Flamengo , one of the clubs which pushed for football ’s return in June , said they feared calling up fringe players for Sunday ’s match would only exacerbate the situation . 
Dunshee said : There ’s no point in bringing in youth players to play as their health and the health of their families is put at risk . 
The risk is enormous that the players that have not tested positive yet will test positive tomorrow or Monday . 
We need , to guarantee everyone ’s ( wellbeing ) , for Flamengo not to play . 
Brazil has the second highest number of coronavirus deaths after the US . 
More than 135,000 Brazilians have died from the virus . 
Football restarted in Brazil in June with Flamengo kicking off the Rio de Janeiro state championship . 
Other state tournaments followed suit in July and August .
