Jordan ’s prime minister Omar al Razzaz promised on Sunday to deepen a crackdown on tax evasion that officials say has deprived the country ’s cash strapped economy of billions of dollars ’ revenue in recent years . 
The government has gone after senior businessmen and former politicians suspected of tax dodging , money laundering and customs evasion in a weeks long campaign that has gained greater urgency with the hit to state finances from the Covid 19 pandemic . 
" Protecting public money and fighting corruption is a national duty , " Razzaz said in his weekly television address to the nation . 
Tax authorities have raided around 650 companies so far , according to officials who say this is the biggest campaign to combat tax evasion in decades . 
The government said it had frozen the assets of dozens of companies and businessmen on suspected tax evasion charges . 
It added that it would track offshore havens where wealthy Jordanians have long parked cash to avoid taxes . 
Some critics have accused the government of using the campaign to carry out a witch hunt against its political enemies , including some of Jordan ’s leading business figures , including former ministers and senior politicians . 
Officials deny that , saying the goal is to ensure justice and that no one is above the law . 
The government has been using its wider powers under a state of emergency since March to give prosecutors and the main anti corruption agency greater powers , and stiffen penalties . 
A two month coronavirus lockdown has crippled Jordanian businesses and slashed state revenues by tens of millions of dollars , leading to the sharpest economic contraction in two decades . 
The government expects the economy to shrink by 3.5 % this year , a far cry from an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) estimate of 2 % growth before the pandemic .
