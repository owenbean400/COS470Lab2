Boys have fallen further behind girls at reading regularly and enjoying it during the UK lockdown , a study suggests . 
The gender gap in the numbers of children who say they take pleasure in reading and who read daily appears to have widened , prompting fears that boys could be at risk of losing out as a result of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Greater access to audiobooks at school and home may help re engage boys with literacy , the report from the National Literacy Trust ( NLT ) and Puffin says , as findings suggest these are more popular with boys . 
Fiona Evans , the director of schools programmes at the NLT , called for more schools to introduce " audio libraries " , and for fathers and grandfathers to be role models to encourage more reading among boys .
