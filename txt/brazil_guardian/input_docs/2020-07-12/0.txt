A staff member involved in the preparation of the first executions of US federal prisoners in 17 years has tested positive for coronavirus , the Bureau of Prisons said on Sunday . 
In a court filing , the bureau said the employee based at the justice department ’s execution chamber in Terre Haute , Indiana , attended a meeting with outside law enforcement in preparation for the scheduled executions and another meeting on how to handle any demonstrators . 
He did not come into contact with members of the execution protocol team , the bureau said . 
The news comes two days after a US federal judge blocked the first execution , due to be carried out on Monday , after some of the victims ’ relatives sued , saying they feared that attending could expose them to Covid 19 . 
Judge Jane Magnus Stinson ordered the justice department to delay the execution of Daniel Lewis Lee until it could show it was upholding the right of victims ’ relatives to attend without risking their health . 
The justice department said it would appeal , Reuters reports . 
Another prisons employee had previously tested positive for the virus , and has since recovered . 
Lee ’s scheduled death by lethal injection is one of four executions that had been scheduled for July and August . 
All four men were convicted of killing children . 
Wesley Purkey ’s execution was scheduled for Wednesday , but a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay this month and it was not clear whether it would proceed . 
Dustin Honken ’s is set for Friday .
