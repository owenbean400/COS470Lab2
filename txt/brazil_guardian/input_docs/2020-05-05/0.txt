A regional capital in Brazil has become the country ’s first city to declare a total lockdown – in direct opposition to the president Jair Bolsonaro , who has railed against social isolation and dismissed a soaring death toll . 
The lockdown in São Luís , capital of the north estern state of Maranhão , and three neighbouring towns , was ordered by a judge after intensive care beds in state government hospitals filled up . 
States such as Rio de Janeiro are watching closely . 
But the move came as looser social isolation measures introduced by state governors crumble across Brazil and cases soar . 
Roadblocks have been set up , private cars banned , and only essential services such as pharmacies and supermarkets allowed to open . 
" People do not understand how harmful it is to be on the street , " said Elvira de Araujo , 60 , a public servant isolating in São José de Ribamar , one of the towns affected , who has lost relatives to the disease . 
Maranhão ’s leftist governor Flávio Dino defended the lockdown in a television interview . 
" We trust in the good faith of people , " he said . 
Maranhão has reported 4,227 cases and 249 deaths but numbers across Brazil are believed to be much higher and the country has already surpassed China with 7,321 deaths reported and 107,780 confirmed cases . 
Messages were blared from loudspeakers in the Coroadinho favela in São Luís , where shops closed this morning in contrast to recent weeks , said teacher Christiane Mendes , 36 . 
Across São Luís streets were empty , said Daniel Barros , 32 , whose restaurant is only doing deliveries . 
" I have already lost people close to me who got sick , who were intubated , who died . 
So I prefer it even though it costs me , " he said . 
" They should have done it sooner . "
