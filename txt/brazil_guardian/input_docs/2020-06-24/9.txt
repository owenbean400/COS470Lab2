Turkey is not considering tightening its lockdown restrictions even though the number of daily coronavirus infections registered since they were eased is " higher than anticipated " , the health minister said on Wednesday . 
Speaking to reporters following the weekly meeting of the country â€™s scientific advisory council , Fahrettin Koca blamed the uptick in cases on widespread complacency and failure to comply with physical distancing , AP reports . 
" We can say that the numbers are higher than what we anticipated , " Koca said . 
" We see that many people are under the perception that we have returned to normal . 
This perception must rapidly be deactivated."Turkey has witnessed an increase in the daily number of infections after the government authorised cafes , restaurants , gyms , parks , beaches and museums to reopen and eased stay at home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June . 
The country has been registering average daily infections of around 1,260 since 12 June , up from around 800 to 900 previously . 
Koca on Wednesday reported 1,492 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours , bringing the total infections registered in the country since March to 191,657 . 
He also said there were 24 new Covid 19 deaths , taking the total to 5,025 .
