Ireland is set to become the latest European country to launch a voluntary phone tracking app next week to alert users if someone they have been in contact with develops Covid 19 , the head of its health service operator said , Reuters reports . 
Ireland ’s Health Service Executive ( HSE ) announced plans to roll out the phone app in late March , just as the country went into lockdown , and initially expected it to be launched within 10 days . 
HSE ’s chief executive , Paul Reid , told a news conference on Wednesday that it has been approved by Ireland ’s data protection agency and was awaiting final signoff by the government . 
So far , 1,720 people have died from Covid 19 in Ireland , which has had a manual contact tracing programme in place since its outbreak began at the end of February . 
The number of confirmed cases has fallen to an average of 11 a day over the past week as the economy prepares to almost fully reopen next week , with just 37 patients in hospital compared to a peak of nearly 900 that threatened to overwhelm the health service in mid April . 
Ireland will adopt a decentralised model for its tracing app where the data will be held on the person ’s mobile phone and not centrally by the health service , which authorities hope will alleviate privacy concerns . 
" We ’ve done our own research in the early stages of the trial , there is pretty much a positive pick up , that people feel they will use it and would use it in the future . 
We ’d be strongly encouraged by that , " Reid said .
