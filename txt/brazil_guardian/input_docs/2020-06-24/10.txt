British families falling out of work during the coronavirus crisis will get £ 1,600 less on average in benefits than they would have done without a decade of austerity imposed by the Conservatives . 
Even after taking account of emergency additions to the welfare safety net launched as the virus spread to Britain earlier this year , the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) said benefits for out of work households were worth 10 % less than in 2011 . 
A decade on from George Osborne ’s first austerity budget in June 2010 , the analysis from Britain ’s leading tax and spending thinktank showed the impact was worse for families with children . 
For an average out of work household with children , the shortfall jumps to £ 2,900 a year or 12 % , less than was available in 2011 before the cuts kicked in .
