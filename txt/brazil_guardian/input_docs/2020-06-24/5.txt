The Mexican health authorities are trying to understand how a set of newborn triplets became infected even though neither of their parents tested positive . 
Health authorities called the case " unheard of " . 
The triplets , a girl and two boys , were tested four hours after being born last week in the central state San Luis Potosi , health authorities said . 
Initially , health authorities said the mother was believed to be an asymptomatic carrier . 
But her tests later showed that neither she nor the father were infected .
