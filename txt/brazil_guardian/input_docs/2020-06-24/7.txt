In the Canadian province of Ontario , some people who test positive but who are asymptomatic will be allowed to return immediately to their workplaces with precautions , separated from those who do not have the virus , according to guidance released on Wednesday . 
Reuters reported that the guidance document said " work self isolation " outside of healthcare settings would be allowed for asymptomatic employees " deemed critical to operations " at local public health workers ’ discretion and that employers would be responsible for ensuring they do not put others at risk . 
The province is battling outbreaks that have killed three migrant farmworkers , and has started mass testing asymptomatic farmworkers . 
The change could send some of them back to their jobs . 
It was prompted by a cluster of farmworkers who tested positive but were all asymptomatic , said Ontario ’s chief medical officer of health David Williams . 
" As we learn more , we change things , we adapt , " he told a briefing in Toronto .
