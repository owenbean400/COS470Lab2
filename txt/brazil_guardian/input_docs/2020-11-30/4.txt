Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to move ahead with changes to the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) fund , amid fears of future economic uncertainty due to Covid 19 . 
The IMF had already warned that governments and the ECB may need to provide more support than initially expected because of the second wave of Covid 19 . 
The fund was set up to help member states in financial difficulty , However German finance minister Olaf Scholz said : " The ESM reform strengthens the euro and the entire European banking sector because we are making the eurozone even more robust against attacks by speculators . "
