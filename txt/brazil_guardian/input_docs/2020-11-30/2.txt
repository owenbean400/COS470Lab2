Ratings agency Moody ’s has said that most countries still face a " significant negative shock " from the pandemic , and that vaccine trials have not caused it to change its forecasts . 
" Most ( sovereigns ) face a significant economic loss , a marked increase in their debt burden , and some , in particular emerging markets , face a deterioration in debt affordability , " a top sovereign analyst at Moody ’s told Reuters . 
Moody ’s said in October that the global recession caused by the pandemic has been far deeper than expected and has disproportionately affected emerging and frontier market nations .
