A record 1,262 Covid 19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country ’s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic . 
The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil ’s health ministry , which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383 , second only to the United States . 
The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy , where 33,530 deaths have been recorded , as the country with the third highest number of deaths . 
But Brazil ’s far right president , Jair Bolsonaro , who has dismissed Covid 19 as a " little flu " , again brushed off the tragedy on Tuesday."I regret each of the deaths - but that ’s everyone ’s destiny , " Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capital Brasília . 
Brazil ’s most populous state , São Paulo , registered a record number of deaths on Tuesday taking the total number of fatalities there to nearly 8,000 . 
Rio de Janeiro has Brazil ’s second highest death toll with 5,686 deaths , followed by the northeastern state of Ceará where 3,421 people have died . 
For all Bolsonaro ’s dismissiveness , scientists and medical experts believe the situation is dire and likely to get worse . 
" Not even in our most dreadful nightmare could we have imagined the situation we are now in , " Drauzio Varella , a doctor and broadcaster , wrote in one of Brazil ’s top newspapers last week .
