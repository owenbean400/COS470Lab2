The US and Brazilian presidents , Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro , are pushing for a joint research effort on using a drug to treat Covid 19 that has been linked to increased deaths in virus patients . 
Trump has repeatedly touted use of the anti malarial drug hydroxychloroquine , even admitting to taking it himself as a preventative measure . 
US health bosses have cautioned against its use outside of a hospital setting because of a risk of heart problems . 
The White House said Trump and Bolsonaro " expressed their mutual appreciation for the longstanding collaboration on health issues between the two countries " , discussing the US delivery of 2m doses of the controversial drug to Brazil and a " joint research effort to help further evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for both prophylaxis and the early treatment of the coronavirus " .
