The US has supplied Brazil with 2 million doses of the anti malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus , despite medical warnings about the risks associated with it . 
The two governments released a joint announcement just days after the WHO suspended testing it on Covid 19 patients due to health concerns . 
Both presidents have promoted its use , despite the US Food and Drug Administration issuing a warning about its use against the virus . 
" The American and Brazilian people stand in solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus , " the statement said . 
" We are announcing the United States Government has delivered two million doses of hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) to the people of Brazil . 
" HCQ will be used as a prophylactic to help defend Brazil â€™s nurses , doctors and healthcare professionals against the virus . 
It will also be used as a therapeutic to treat Brazilians who become infected . 
The countries will also carry out a joint research effort , including " randomised controlled clinical trials " , and the US has pledged to send 1,000 ventilators to Brazil .
