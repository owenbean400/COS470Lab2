Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro joined a rally on Sunday on horseback as supporters called for the Supreme Court to be shut down for investigating the right wing leader , as one of its justices compared the risks to Brazil ’s democracy with Hitler ’s Germany . 
Deepening a political crisis during one of the world ’s worst coronavirus outbreaks , Bolsonaro has slammed the top court for investigating his interference in police affairs and opening an inquiry into his supporters ’ alleged libel and intimidation campaigns on social media . 
He has denounced the investigations , suggesting " absurd orders " should not be followed and warning that the court may " plunge Brazil into a political crisis . " 
Supreme Court Justice Celso de Mello , who is responsible for investigating a former justice minister ’s allegation that Bolsonaro tried to meddle with law enforcement for personal reasons , said the president ’s supporters were seeking a military dictatorship . 
" We must resist the destruction of the democratic order to avoid what happened in the Weimar Republic when Hitler , after he was elected by popular vote ... did not hesitate annulling the constitution and imposing a totalitarian system in 1933 , " de Mello told other judges in a message seen by Reuters and reported in Brazilian newspapers . 
Bolsonaro has said his aims are democratic and accused his opponents of going against the constitution . 
On Saturday night , a group of masked backers of Bolsonaro marched to the court carrying torches to call for its closure . 
During Sunday ’s demonstrations in Sao Paulo , opponents of Bolsonaro took to a main avenue to protest against " fascism " and clashed with riot police who intervened , using tear gas , to stop them getting close to a rally by supporters of the president .
