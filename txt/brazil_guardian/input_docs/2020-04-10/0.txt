Brazil ’s president Jair Bolsonaro – already under fire for his cavalier reaction to the pandemic – has sparked further outrage by ignoring social distancing rules twice in the last 48 hours and being caught on camera shaking the hand of an elderly woman just seconds after wiping his nose with his wrist . 
The nose wipe handshake was caught on camera by one of Brazil ’s major TV networks , Globo , and quickly went viral on social media .

Humberto Costa , a leftwing senator , accused Brazil ’s president of being " an ally of the virus " and " repeatedly committing crimes against public health".Another critic , the journalist William De Lucca , tweeted : " I think perhaps this is the best video showing how NOT to act during a pandemic " . 
Bolsonaro has repeatedly attacked what he calls the media " hysteria " over coronavirus and thumbed his nose at his own health ministry ’s social distancing guidelines on Thursday and Friday with high profile trips to a bakery and a pharmacy . 
During both outings Bolsonaro was booed by detractors . 
On Friday , Brazil ’s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,057 , up from 941 the previous day and nearly three times higher than last Friday ’s figure .
