Chile ´s government said on Monday it would extend a state of catastrophe in place since mid March by 90 days , in response to a surge in infections in the South American nation . 
The pace of new infections has increased dramatically in May and June , averaging over 5,000 daily in recent weeks , filling critical care wards and prompting authorities to declare a full lockdown in the capital Santiago , a city of more than six million . 
The state of catastrophe , extended by presidential decree , gives the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services , Reuters reports . 
Quarantine measures are routinely enforced by soldiers in Santiago . 
South America has become the new epicenter of the global coronavirus crisis , with Peru , Brazil and Chile particularly hard hit . 
Chile has recorded nearly 180,000 infections and more than 3,300 people have died , according to a Reuters tally . 
Chile ´s interior minister Gonzalo Blumel said most Chileans were abiding by increasingly draconian restrictions on movement , but that " a group of people acting irresponsibly are not complying . " 
Blumel said the government would now seek jail time for the most egregious of violations . 
On Sunday , the new health minister Enrique Paris had announced that the country ’s official death toll will include suspected cases , which could double the current figure .
