Israel ’s parliament has voted to allow the country ’s domestic intelligence agency to continue tracking the mobile phones of virus carriers for the rest of the year amid a resurgence in new cases . 
The Shin Bet ’s surveillance technology has been used on and off to track carriers since March and the Knesset approved the measure until 20 January 2021 , the Knesset news agency reported . 
The security agency tracks location data of confirmed carriers for 14 days before they were diagnosed . 
That data is used to identify anyone with whom they came into contact , which proponents say is crucial to infection chains . 
The surveillance has drawn challenges from privacy watchdog groups , and the supreme court cited worries over dangers to individual liberty in demanding the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government regulate the surveillance through legislation . 
The new law includes additional oversight requiring the government to renew its request every three weeks . 
And it can be used only when new daily cases exceed 200 . 
Those ordered into isolation can appeal if they believe the data was inaccurate .
