Colombia ’s number of confirmed cases exceeded 200,000 on Monday , the health ministry said , while deaths from the disease reached 6,929 as the Andean country continues a months long lockdown . 
Colombia now has a total of 204,005 cases , still well behind other Latin American countries like Brazil , Peru , Mexico and Chile , which are among the 10 countries worldwide with the most infections . 
Colombia ’s government has estimated it will reach its peak of cases in August . 
Several cities , including the capital Bogota , are close to full occupation of beds in intensive care units . 
The nationwide quarantine – declared at the end of March by President Ivan Duque – is set to last until 1 August . 
Though certain neighbourhoods , especially in the capital , are under strict restrictions , other areas have loosened rules as the government seeks to stoke the economy , which is expected to contract 5.5 % this year .
