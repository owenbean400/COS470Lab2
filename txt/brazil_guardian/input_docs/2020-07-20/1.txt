A proposed European Union economic recovery package would provide € 390bn of grants and € 360bn of loans , according to Reuters . 
The news agency reports that the proposal submitted to EU leaders on Monday amends the original European commission plans to provide € 500bn and € 250bn respectively to repair the economic damage done by virus lockdowns across the bloc ’s member states . 
The document is meant as a basis for a compromise agreement after four days of acrimonious talks on the package , Reuters reported . 
It also envisages that national plans to spend the money would have to get the approval of a qualified majority of EU governments . 
The disbursement would also be linked to governments observing the rule of law , a fact that would be established also by a qualified majority of governments .
