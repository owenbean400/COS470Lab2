In the UK , the former shadow chancellor John Mc Donnell has called for the urgent nationalisation of care services in response to the pandemic , warning that years of underfunding have put older and disabled people at heightened risk from a second surge in infections this winter . 
In his first significant intervention since stepping down from his shadow position earlier this year , Mc Donnell said fixing Britain â€™s long running crisis in social care should be a top priority of government as Covid 19 exposes severe frailties in the system .
