After recording its highest single day rise in Covid 19 cases ( see 13.54 ) , Iraq has warned hospitals may " lose control " of the virus . 
The health ministry attributed the spike to recent large gatherings that took place without recommended safety measures . 
That included the marking on 30 August of Ashura , a major Muslim day of mourning that commemorates the killing of the Prophet Mohammed â€™s grandson Hussein in 680AD . 
According to the Iraqi health ministry , 5,036 new coronavirus infections were confirmed on Friday , bringing the total number of cases across the country to 252,075 , of which 191,368 had recovered , but 7,359 had died .
