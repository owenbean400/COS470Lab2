Liberia ’s president George Weah has sacked the country ’s top health official over his handling of coronavirus testing in the impoverished West African state . 
Mososka Fallah , director general of the Public Health Institute of Liberia ( NPHIL ) , was removed from his post for " breaches in the health and administrative protocols that guide the issuance of Covid 19 test results , " Weah ’s office said in a statement . 
The decision was made on the recommendation of a committee set up especially to investigate the matter . 
The exact nature of the allegations against Fallah was not revealed but Weah , a former AC Milan footballer , promised to publish the committee ’s report at a later date . 
NPHIL is in charge of handling epidemics such as coronavirus , which has killed 82 people and infected 1,306 in Liberia so far , according to the latest official data . 
An internal source within the institute , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Fallah had been sacked for refusing to attend meetings of an anti coronavirus taskforce because he had not been put in charge of it , AFP reported . 
He was also suspected of issuing " Covid 19 " travel permits without the taskforce ’s knowledge , the source said .
