AFP reports that Iraq on Friday recorded its highest single day rise in Covid 19 cases since the start of the pandemic , prompting authorities to warn hospitals may " lose control " in the coming days . 
According to the Iraqi health ministry , 5,036 new coronavirus infections were confirmed on Friday , bringing the total number of cases across the country to 252,075 , of which 191,368 had recovered , but 7,359 had died . 
The health ministry attributed the spike to recent " large gatherings " that took place without recommended safety measures , including mask wearing or social distancing . 
That included the marking on August 30 of Ashura , a major Muslim day of mourning that commemorates the killing of the Prophet Mohammed ’s grandson Hussein in 680 AD . 
On that day , tens of thousands of Shiite Muslims converged on the holy city of Karbala in southern Iraq . 
Karbala ’s authorities introduced new measures to stem the spread of the virus , including restricting access to areas of worship and widespread spraying of disinfectants . 
But the health ministry warned the measures were not enough . 
" The number of cases is expected to escalate further in the coming days , which we fear will lead our health institutions to lose control as they try to deal with these large numbers , " its statement on Friday said . 
" This will lead to an increase in the number of deaths , after we made headway in reducing them over the past few weeks , " it added . 
Iraq ’s hospitals have already been worn down by decades of conflict and poor investment , with shortages in medicines , hospital beds and even protective equipment for doctors . 
Ahead of Ashura , the World Health Organization had warned that Covid 19 cases in Iraq were rising at an " alarming rate " and said Iraq should take action to end the community outbreak " at all costs " .
