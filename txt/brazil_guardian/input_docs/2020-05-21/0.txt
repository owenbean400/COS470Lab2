Brazil ’s president Jair Bolsonaro said he will sign off a 60 billion real ( $ 10.72 billion ) federal aid programme for states and cities hit by coronavirus , but asked governors for support freezing public sector pay increases . 
The bill to distribute federal money to states and municipalities was approved by Congress earlier this month . 
However , Bolsonaro has not signed off on it due to pressure from economy minister Paulo Guedes , who is pushing for more fiscal austerity , Reuters reports . 
Bolsonaro is under growing pressure for his handling of the outbreak , which looks set to cripple the Brazilian economy and threatens his re election hopes . 
In the coming days , Brazil is likely to become the world ’s second worst affected country , behind only to the United States . 
Nearly 19,000 have died so far from the virus in Brazil , with 291,579 confirmed cases . 
The true number of infections and deaths is likely to be higher as Brazil has not been carrying out widespread testing . 
Bolsonaro ’s relationship with governors and mayors has grown increasingly bitter . 
The president is angry over shutdowns they have implemented to stop the virus ’ spread and argues that keeping the economy running is more important . 
In return for signing off on the aid package , Bolsonaro asked governors for their backing in specific measures freezing public sector pay increases for two years .
