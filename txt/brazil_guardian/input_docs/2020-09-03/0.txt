Brazil ’s vice president Hamilton Mourão has said in a radio interview that immunisation against Covid 19 will necessarily require mass vaccination , and " everyone in the government knows that " . 
He appeared to be clarifying the government ’s position after president Jair Bolsonaro , who has consistently downplayed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak , said on Monday that nobody would be forced to take the vaccine once it is available .
