At least 9,875,040 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 196 countries and territories . 
Of these , at least 4,903,500 are now considered recovered . 
The tallies , using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections .
