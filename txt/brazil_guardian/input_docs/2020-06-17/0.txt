Uki Goñi reports for the Guardian from Buenos Aires : Argentina ’s president Alberto Fernández has gone into voluntary isolation amid growing concerns over a surge of coronavirus infections , including several cases among the country ’s political elite . 
The decision to quarantine the president – whose popularity is riding high on his no nonsense response to the pandemic – was taken due to the " significant increase in the circulation of the virus , " presidential doctor Federico Saavedra said in a statement on Wednesday . 
Until now , Argentina ’s strong coronavirus lockdown , had been a standout success in the containment of the pandemic that is ripping through its South American neighbours Brazil and Chile . 
But that may start changing after Argentina ’s reported cases more than quadrupled in the last month following the gradual lockdown relaxation that began on 10 May .
