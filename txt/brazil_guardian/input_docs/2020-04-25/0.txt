The AP has this report from Brazil , which is on the way to becoming a virus outbreak centre . 
Cases of the new coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals , morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin Americas largest nation veers closer to becoming one of the world â€™s pandemic hot spots . 
Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse , or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients . 
Health experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient , delayed testing . 
Meanwhile , President Jair Bolsonaro has shown no sign of wavering from his insistence that Covid 19 is a relatively minor disease and that broad social distancing measures are not needed to stop it . 
He has said only Brazilians at high risk should be isolated . 
In Manaus , the biggest city in the Amazon , officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths . 
Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day , triple the pre virus average of burials .
