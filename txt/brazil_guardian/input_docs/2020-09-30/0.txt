Chilean health authorities have approved the start of clinical trials for coronavirus vaccines under development by China ’s Sinovac and Johnson & amp ; 
Johnson pharmaceutical unit Janssen . 
The trials , authorised by Chile ’s Institute of Public Health ( ISP ) , will be conducted by government health officials and researchers from two Chilean universities , authorities said . 
Brazil , Chile , Peru and Colombia have had the highest rates of viral infections in South America , making them attractive testing sites for vaccine developers because it is easier to get dependable trial results in areas with high rates of active transmission and infection . 
" Chile can and must participate in these clinical Phase III studies to approve , study and hopefully move forward the development of these vaccines , " health minister Enrique Paris told reporters . 
Large scale Phase III clinical trials can be the final step before a drug or vaccine is submitted for regulatory approval . 
Chile has been particularly hard hit by the virus , with more than 462,000 cases reported and 12,741 deaths from Covid 19 .
