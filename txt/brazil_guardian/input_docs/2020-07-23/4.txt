Brazil ’s president , Jair Bolsonaro , is again coming under fire after being caught on camera chatting with cleaners on the grounds of his official residence without a mask - despite testing positive for the coronavirus only yesterday . 
The far right populist , whose dismissive response to the pandemic has been globally condemned , first announced he had been diagnosed with Covid 19 in early July , when Brazil had suffered more than 65,000 deaths and 1.6m confirmed cases . 
Since then Brazil ’s death toll has risen to nearly 83,000 - the second highest in the world – and the number of cases to 2.2m , a record 67,860 of which were recorded yesterday . 
Brazil ’s president again tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday and has supposedly been in isolation since 6 July . 
Despite that Bolsonaro – who has undermined social distancing efforts and repeatedly downplayed the illness as a " bit of a cold " – was on Thursday spotted by a Reuters photographer roaming the estate around Brasília ’s Palácio da Alvorada on a motorbike and talking to cleaners without gear to protect them .
