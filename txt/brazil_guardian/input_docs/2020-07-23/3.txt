New York City has reached its goal of performing 50,000 coronavirus tests a day and its contact tracing effort has potentially prevented thousands of new infections , officials said . 
Mayor Bill de Blasio said four new clinics operated by the urgent care company Med Rite will bring the total citywide daily testing capacity to 50,000 . 
" This is the number we ’ve been wanting to get to for quite a while . 
We will now have that capacity , " he said . 
Dr Ted Long , the head of the city ’s contact tracing effort , said the average wait for test results citywide is now two days , down from more than double that a week ago , but he acknowledged that waits at some testing sites have been much longer .
