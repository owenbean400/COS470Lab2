Donald Trump has called off the GOP National Convention in Florida , citing the " flare up " of coronavirus but the North Carolina events will still take place to formally renominate him on August 24 . 
Trump said that it is " not the right time " for a big convention in Jacksonville . 
Jacksonville , Florida residents filed a lawsuit against the city , the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign earlier this month to stop the convention in August over concerns that a big event would accelerate the spread of disease in a state that is already a coronavirus hotspot .
