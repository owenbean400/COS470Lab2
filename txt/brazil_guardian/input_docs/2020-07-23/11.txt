Former UK prime minister Tony Blair believes coronavirus will not be eliminated . 
He urged the UK government to focus on containment measures to see the country through a second wave . 
In an interview with the PA news agency , Blair described the crisis as " the biggest challenge logistically and practically " a government has ever faced , but criticised ministers for not yet putting in place an " infrastructure of containment " . 
He said : " The reality is that we ’re going to be living with Covid 19 - we ’re not really going to be able to eliminate it . 
" And when you look at what has been happening in other countries , as lockdown has been eased , then more and more problems have appeared and many countries , having gone into lockdown then easing it , are finding spikes in the disease . 
" You ca not be sure of this but there ’s at least a 50/50 chance that you have a resurgence of the disease in the autumn and that ’s why it is absolutely essential now to prepare for that . 
" And to put in place every single last bit of containment infrastructure that you possibly can to make sure that if that happens you are able to control the disease , because you ’re not going to be able to go back into the lockdown that we endured in March , April and May . " 
A new report by his think tank , the Tony Blair Institute , calls for public confidence to be rebuilt " on the knowledge that every possible step has been taken to mitigate risk " - requiring containment measures in the absence of a " game changer " vaccine or treatment . 
It recommends the rollout of mass testing , mandated use of face masks in all enclosed public environments , and suggests introducing an individual risk categorisation - with A showing those most at risk , to people with low health risks and a low transmission risk in category D .
