The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have warned about the " lasting " mental health impact of Covid 19 as their foundation awarded almost £ 1.8 million to support frontline workers and others affected by the pandemic in the UK . 
The Duchess said the couple are " in awe " of the efforts of frontline and emergency responders during the outbreak , as they spoke to some of the 10 UK organisations who have benefited from the grants . 
The couple ’s Royal Foundation Covid 19 Response Fund is helping a range of projects , from ensuring all emergency workers have access to individual grief trauma from Hospice UK , to helping early years charity Best Beginnings support an extra 20,000 new mothers . 
Kate and William spoke privately earlier this week with two emergency responders and two mental health counsellors whose organisations are being supported by the fund . 
During the open air meeting at the Queen ’s Sandringham estate , the duchess told them : " Over recent months we have all been in awe of the incredible work that frontline staff and emergency responders have been doing in response to Covid 19 . 
" But we know that for many of them , their families , and for thousands of others across the UK , the pandemic will have a lasting impact on their mental health . "
