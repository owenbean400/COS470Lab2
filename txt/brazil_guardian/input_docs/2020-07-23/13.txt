Mothers who have Covid 19 infection are unlikely to pass the virus to their newborns if appropriate hygiene precautions are taken , a small study suggests . 
The findings , which involved 120 babies and their mothers , suggest that mothers can breastfeed and stay in the same room as their newborns , if they use face coverings and follow infection control procedures . 
The research is published in The Lancet Child & amp ; 
Adolescent Health journal . 
Lead author Dr Christine M Salvatore , from the Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Komansky Children â€™s Hospital in the US , said : " Data on the risk of Covid 19 transmission during pregnancy or while breastfeeding are limited to a small number of case studies . 
" Consequently , guidelines for pregnant women and new mothers vary . 
" We hope our study will provide some reassurance to new mothers that the risk of them passing Covid 19 to their babies is very low . 
" However , larger studies are needed to better understand the risks of transmission from mother to child . "
