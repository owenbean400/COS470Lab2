Bolivia ’s general election will be pushed back until October 18 due to the pandemic . 
The head of the electoral tribunal said on Thursday that the vote would be postponed from the previously scheduled September 6 date to ensure the safety of voters , with hospitals and cemeteries straining under the impact of the virus . 
" This election requires the highest possible health security measures to protect the health of Bolivians , " tribunal President Salvador Romero told a news conference in La Paz . 
The vote is key to the political future of the Andean nation of 11.5 million people after a fraught election last year sparked widespread protests and led to the resignation of the country ’s long term leftist president Evo Morales . 
In a political vacuum and amid deadly conflicts on the street , right wing lawmaker Jeanine Anez was ushered into power , pledging to hold quick new elections , originally planned for May before being delayed by the pandemic to September . 
Anez is running in the election , while Morales is pulling the political strings from exile in Argentina with his Movement for Socialism party , whose candidate Luis Arce leads in some polls . 
Morales wrote on Twitter the delay " will only harm the people " and blamed the interim government for its response to the pandemic . 
He added the move was unconstitutional and a tactic for his opponents to " gain more time . " 
Anez said she would accept the new date . 
" Whatever the date , the government calls for promoting economic revival , the fight against the virus and the consolidation of democracy , " she wrote on Twitter . 
The new election schedule would see a second round held on November 29 if there was no clear winner in the first round vote .
