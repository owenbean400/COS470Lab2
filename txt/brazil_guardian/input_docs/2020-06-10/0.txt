São Paulo , Brazil ’s most populous state , has reported a record number of deaths for the second day running – even as its metropolis allowed shops to reopen . 
The epicentre of the Brazilian epidemic has recorded 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours , raising the state ’s confirmed death toll to 9,862 , a fourth of the country ’s total fatalities , the governor ’s office said . 
That did not stop shoppers flocking to the 25 de Março shopping district where around half of the businesses were open . 
Although stores considered essential , such as supermarkets and pharmacies , have remained open , most shops in São Paulo have been shut since March . 
Shoppers packed the streets . 
Stores allowed in only people wearing masks and provided alcohol gel . 
Some took the temperature of shoppers at the entrance . 
" I ’m afraid because the virus is growing , but at the same time we have to go to work and buy things to sell , though always protected by a mask , " said Vanessa Pereira , a saleswoman . 
The city ’s shopping centres will reopen on Thursday for four hours a day after agreeing with authorities on reducing public access as a precaution against the contagion . 
In Rio de Janeiro , the second hardest hit Brazilian city , the mayor announced malls will also reopen on Thursday as part of a scheduled easing of restrictions . 
The decisions to reopen shops has been advocated by Brazil ’s far right president Jair Bolsonaro , who has minimised the gravity of the outbreak and dismissed warnings by public health experts that the contagion is still surging . 
Brazil has 739,503 confirmed cases , the world ’s worst outbreak after the United States , and has suffered from at least 38,406 deaths . 
Earlier , Bolsonaro told an actress to " get out of here " after she criticised his response to the pandemic at a gathering of supporters outside his official residence in the capital Brasilia .
