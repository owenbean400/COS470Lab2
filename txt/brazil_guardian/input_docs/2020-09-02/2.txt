Brazil ’s Covid 19 death toll appears to be easing for the first time since May , data shows , a sign the Latin American country could be descending from a long infection plateau that has seen it suffer the world ’s second worst outbreak after the United States , Reuters reports . 
With nearly 4 million confirmed cases , the virus has killed over 120,000 people in Brazil . 
But the level of average daily deaths dropped below 900 per day last week - the lowest in three and a half months and below the rate of both the United States and India , according to a Reuters tally . 
Researchers at Imperial College London also calculate that the transmission rate in Brazil , at which each person infected with the coronavirus infects another person , is now below 1 , the level required for new infections to slow . 
However , the rate previously fell below 1 in August , only to rebound a week later , according to Imperial . 
The government statistics are also volatile . 
On Tuesday and Wednesday , Brazil registered more than 1,100 deaths each day , and experts say it is too early to say the worst is over."We are on a downward trend compared to the previous high plateau , " said Roberto Medronho , an infectious diseases expert at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro . 
" But , the numbers are still high and we have to remain vigilant so that it does not grow again . "
