Brazilian health minister Eduardo Pazuello is in stable condition in a hospital after being diagnosed with Covid 19 , the ministry said in a statement on Saturday . 
Pazuello checked into a hospital in Brasilia on Friday for dehydration , having tested positive for the coronavirus on 21 October . 
He will stay in the hospital until Sunday , when his condition will be re evaluated , the ministry said . 
" There has been no need for supportive measures such as oxygen supplementation , " the statement said . 
A day after testing positive , Pazuello met rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro in a hotel room , with a social media video showing the two chatting without masks , Reuters reports . 
Bolsonaro recovered from a bout of Covid 19 in July . 
The president claimed Pazuello ’s case was another instance demonstrating that the controversial drug chloroquine helped those with Covid 19 to recover more quickly . 
Bolsonaro , who has sought to downplay the severity of the virus , has advocated for the use of the anti malarial drug chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine , despite a lack of scientific evidence that they help those with Covid 19 . 
During the pandemic , two successive health ministers resigned in roughly the span of a month , in part because as physicians , they would not fully endorse chloroquine . 
Brazil has the second deadliest outbreak of coronavirus , with 159,477 deaths , after only the US . 
Roughly half of Bolsonaro ’s 23 member cabinet have caught the coronavirus , as well as the president and his wife .
