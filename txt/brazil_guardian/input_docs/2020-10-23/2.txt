Brazil ’s health regulator has authorised the import from China of a potential vaccine against the coronavirus , just days after president Jair Bolsonaro insisted he would not allow doses to be shipped from the Asian nation , AP reports . 
The health regulator , Anvisa , said in a statement Friday that Sao Paulo state ’s Butantan Institute can import 6 million doses of the Corona Vac shot that Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac is developing . 
The potential vaccine cannot be administered to Brazilians as it is not yet approved locally , the statement said . 
Earlier this week , Bolsonaro sparked confusion when he publicly rejected the Corona Vac shot , saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs . 
The declaration followed news that his health minister , Eduardo Pazuello , had agreed to purchase Corona Vac doses produced locally by the Butantan Institute . 
On Wednesday , the executive secretary of Brazil ’s Health Ministry said in a televised statement that there had been a misunderstanding . 
" There is no intention to buy vaccines from China , " said Antonio Elcio Franco , who added there will be only " a Brazilian vaccine " made at the Butantan Institute . 
Brazil ’s presidential palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Anvisa ’s authorisation of imported vials .
