Coronavirus has dealt a " shattering blow " to Westminster Abbey ’s finances , the church ’s dean has said . 
The abbey in London is set to lose £ 12 million in revenue this year and possibly next year and could make some of its staff redundant as a result of the lockdown . 
It closed on March 20 , causing a loss of entrance fees which make up more than 90 % of its income , according to Dr David Hoyle , the Dean of Westminster Abbey . 
Dr Hoyle told the BBC : " I ’ve been hearing pretty routinely from volunteers , from members of staff , just about a savage sense of loss , there ’s been a church here for over a thousand years and we ’re not used to being shut . 
" So that ’s been dislocating and then , of course , a few weeks into this we began to measure out just what was going to happen to us financially and that ’s been a pretty shattering blow . "
