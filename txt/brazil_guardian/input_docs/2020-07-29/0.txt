Brazil ’s coronavirus outbreak set daily records on Wednesday with both 69,074 new confirmed cases and 1,595 related deaths , as the world ’s second worst outbreak accelerates toward the milestone of 100,000 lives cut short . 
Brazil is the country worst hit by Covid 19 outside of the United States in both death toll and case count , with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases and 90,134 deaths since the pandemic began , according to ministry data . 
Sao Paulo , Brazil ’s most populous and hardest hit state , has been working through a backlog of previously unregistered cases , reporting more than 26,000 cases on Wednesday alone . 
President Jair Bolsonaro has pressed to reopen the Brazilian economy , with lockdowns lifting in many cities despite the toll of the disease continuing to rise . 
In some cases , Brazilians have packed into bars and crowded public squares , often in defiance of local rules . 
Bolsonaro himself has flouted social distancing guidelines by joining supporters at rallies around Brasilia , the capital , in recent months . 
He fell ill with coronavirus this month , and spent weeks in partial isolation before recovering . 
The right wing populist has argued the economic damage from lockdowns is worse than the disease itself , which he has played down as " a little flu " that can be cured by unproven treatments , involving the anti malarial drug hydroxychloroquine .
