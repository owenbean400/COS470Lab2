Brazil has registered 1,022 new deaths , bringing the country â€™s total number of known Covid 19 fatalities from 48,954 to 49,976 , the health ministry said on Saturday . 
The tally of confirmed infections increased from 1,032,913 on Friday to 1,067,579 on Saturday , a rise of 34,666 . 
Experts say the true numbers are likely far higher due to a lack of widespread testing . 
Since first arriving in the continent sized country , the virus has spread relentlessly , eroding support for right wing president Jair Bolsonaro and raising fears of economic collapse after years of anemic growth , Reuters reports . 
Bolsonaro , sometimes called the " Tropical Trump , " has been widely criticised for his handling of the crisis . 
The country still has no permanent health minister after losing two since April , following clashes with the president . 
Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing , calling it a job killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself . 
He has also promoted two anti malarial drugs as remedies , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , despite little evidence they work .
