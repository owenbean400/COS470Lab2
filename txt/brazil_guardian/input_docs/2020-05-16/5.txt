Schools and beaches in Israel will reopen this week as the country further lifts its lockdown , Haaretz reports . 
The government has approved the resumption of school for all grades in areas that are not considered coronavirus hotspots . 
The return to school starting on Sunday will be at the discretion of local authorities . 
Some regional councils have already announced that they will delay the opening of schools by a day due to difficulties in organising school buses at such short notice . 
Beaches will officially open on Wednesday , but thousands of people already flocked to Tel Aviv â€™s beaches over the weekend despite a ban still being in place . 
Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced that the Palestinian government will allow shops to reopen from Saturday and up until next Friday , from morning until the evening and during the Ramadan break fast meal .
