The British government is to invest £ 93m ( $ 112m ) to bring forward the opening of a new vaccine manufacturing centre ready to begin production if a coronavirus vaccine is found . 
The Department for Business , Energy and Industrial Strategy ( Beis ) said on Saturday that the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre ( VMIC ) will now open in summer 2021 - 12 months earlier than planned , the Press Association reports . 
The not for profit facility , located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxford , will have the capacity to produce enough doses for the entire UK population in as little as six months . 
A further £ 38m is being invested in a rapid deployment facility which will be able to begin manufacturing at scale from the summer of this year if a vaccine becomes available before the new centre is complete . 
Officials said the VMIC would also boost the UK ’s long term capacity for dealing with future viruses and accelerate the production of vaccines for existing illnesses such as the flu virus . 
Announcing the investment , business secretary Alok Sharma said : " Once a breakthrough is made , we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions . "
