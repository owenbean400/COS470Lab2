Neglecting indigenous people during the pandemic is a " crime against humanity " , the mayor of the largest city in the Amazon rainforest has said . 
Arthur Virgilio Neto , the mayor of Manaus , said the virus is killing indigenous people and warned of a " genocide " if Brazil ’s right wing government fails to protect vulnerable tribes . 
So far , 25 indigenous people have died in the rainforest as the outbreak slowly penetrates remote villages . 
But more than 100 have been killed by the virus in urban areas , health authorities and indigenous groups said . 
" I fear a genocide , " said Neto , whose city is home to 2 million people and is the capital of Amazonas state . 
The mayor said the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was not concerned about the plight of indigenous people and doing nothing to save lives threatened by the outbreak . 
" It is a crime against humanity what they are doing here in my state of Amazonas , in my region . " he said . 
Bolsonaro ’s office did not reply to Reuters ’ requests for comment . 
Healthcare for indigenous people is the responsibility of the federal health ministry and its indigenous health service Sesai , which does not treat members of a tribe who have migrated away from their ancestral lands . 
Health experts say the outbreak that first broke out in the cities is now spreading to isolated areas where the population has no access to healthcare . 
Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday they were particularly concerned about contagion in the tri border area of the Amazon between Colombia , Peru and Brazil .
