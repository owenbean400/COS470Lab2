Brazil is expected to surpass 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday , second only to the United States , with total deaths fast approaching 50,000 as the country struggles with a tense political climate and worsening economic outlook . 
The true extent of the outbreak in Brazil far exceeds official figures released after 6 pm local time on most evenings , according to many experts , who cite a lack of widespread testing in the country as a factor adding to many uncertainties about the disease , Reuters reports . 
Alexandre Naime Barbosa , a medical professor at the São Paulo State University said : That number of 1 million is much less than the real number of people who have been infected , because there is under reporting of a magnitude of five to ten times . 
The true number is probably at least 3 million and could even be as high as 10 million people . 
Brazil ’s health ministry reported 978,142 total confirmed cases and 47,748 related deaths on Thursday evening . 
The count has risen by a daily average of 25,000 new cases and 1,000 fatalities for the past week . 
But by Friday afternoon , a consortium of Brazilian news outlets keeping an independent tally of COVID 19 statistics from state health officials reported the country had already passed the benchmark of 1 million confirmed cases .
