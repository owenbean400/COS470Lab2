Brazil has just announced its latest coronavirus statistics . 
Twenty five dead and 1,546 confirmed cases as of today . 
That is up from 18 and 1,128 yesterday . 
South east Brazil has so far borne the brunt of the crisis and of the fatalities 22 were in Brazil ’s most populous state , São Paulo and three in the neighbouring state of Rio de Janeiro . 
Both states are now in a state of partial shutdown with São Paulo set to enter a two week period of quarantine on Tuesday . 
Streets were eerily empty on Sunday in parts of Rio although supermarkets and some shops remain open . 
Brazil ’s far right president - whose response to the crisis has been widely criticised - has attacked the governors of Rio and São Paulo - who he sees as potential presidential rivals in the 2022 election - for the drastic steps they are taking."They are creating a climate of terror , " by trying to shut airports and keep people at home , Bolsonaro said on Saturday . 
But there have now been five nights of protests against Bolsonaro ’s administration and his handling of coronavirus here and many observers believe his reaction has already wrecked any hope of re election .
