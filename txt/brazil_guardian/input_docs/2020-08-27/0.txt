Poland will ban flights from 46 countries , including France and Spain , as of 2 September , according to a draft regulation published on Thursday , as the country grapples with a spike in coronavirus infections . 
The move follows targeted measures to reintroduce restrictions on public life in the worst affected parts of the country , as the government tries to tackle the spread of the virus without resorting to a complete lockdown . 
" Due to the threat of spreading SARS Co V 2 virus infections , it is necessary to exercise the right to introduce air traffic bans ... in order to minimize the threat to public health , " the regulation said . 
Poland closed its borders and suspended flights in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus . 
However , it progressively loosened restrictions on public life , with shopping centres , hotels and restaurants all reopening in May . Polish national airline PLL LOT resumed international flights on 1 July almost four months after suspending them . 
Other countries affected by the ban are popular tourist destinations Montenegro and Croatia , as well as Romania , the US , Israel , Mexico and Brazil . 
Poland has reported 64,689 cases of the novel coronavirus and 2,010 deaths .
