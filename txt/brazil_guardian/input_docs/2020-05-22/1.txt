Indigenous organisations in Brazil have protested against the inclusion in a bill on emergency assistance to tribes in the pandemic of a paragraph authorising Christian missionaries to remain in indigenous communities . 
It provides rapid Covid 19 tests , medicine and food to indigenous communities while allowing them to control access to their territories to avoid the spread of virus . 
But in an inclusion called " sneaky " by critics , the bill said evangelising missionaries that are already in indigenous communities could stay subject to medical exams . 
The largest umbrella organisation representing Amazon indigenous tribes , COIAB , said : We absolutely reject this attempt to allow access of missionaries to indigenous territories here there are isolated tribes . 
COIAB said the presence of evangelizing missionaries has historically brought " tragedy and death " to indigenous people in the Amazon , and was a particular threat to isolated tribes that have only entered recent contact with Brazilian society .
