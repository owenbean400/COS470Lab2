The World Health Organization ( WHO ) called on Monday for a rapid increase in production of dexamethasone , a cheap steroid which has been shown to reduce deaths in critically ill coronavirus patients . 
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said demand had already surged after a British trial of the drug was publicised but he was confident production could be ramped up . 
Some 2,000 patients were given the drug by researchers led by a team from Oxford University , and it reduced deaths by 35 % among the most sickly , according to findings published last week . 
" Although the data are still preliminary , the recent finding that the steroid dexamethasone has life saving potential for critically ill Covid 19 patients gave us a much needed reason to celebrate , " Tedros told a virtual news conference in Geneva , according to AFP .
