Data from the Serbian state â€™s Covid 19 information system shows that more than twice as many infected patients have died than the authorities announced , and hundreds more people tested positive for the virus in recent days than the Serbian government has made public , the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network ( BIRN ) reported on Monday . 
In the period from 19 March to 1 June , a total of 632 people died in Serbia who had tested positive for the coronavirus , more than twice as many as the official number of 244 deaths that has been announced for that period . 
Another data set from the same information system also indicates that the number of people who became infected in Serbia between 17 June and 20 June was at least 300 per day , BIRN reported . 
This would be far more than the officially announced figures , which recorded a maximum of 97 new cases in a single day during that period .
