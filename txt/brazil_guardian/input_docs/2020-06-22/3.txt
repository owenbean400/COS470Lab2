The Belgian government is giving its citizens free rail journeys for the rest of the year , as a major incentive to take a ‘ staycation ’ in Belgium instead of travelling abroad this year . 
Every Belgian resident aged 12 and over will be entitled to a " national tour " rail pass giving them 12 free journeys to anywhere in the country , in an attempt to boost the country ’s tourism sector which suffered badly from the lockdown , Forbes reports . 
The free journeys can be claimed at a rate of two per month , from August 2020 to January 2021 . 
Bikes will also be able to travel on trains for free starting on 1 July , avoiding the normal charge of € 4 per bike . 
Belgium closed its borders in mid March in response to the coronavirus outbreak and banned people from travelling within the country .
