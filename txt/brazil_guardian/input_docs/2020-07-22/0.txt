Aritana Yawalapiti , one of Brazil ’s most influential indigenous leaders , has arrived at a hospital in the central city of Goiânia early on Wednesday to be treated at an intensive care unit after an arduous journey over rural roads with a dwindling supply of oxygen , Reuters reports . 
The hospitalisation of Aritana , who is around 70 years old and leads the people of the Upper Xingu in central Brazil , is a powerful symbol of the threat to vulnerable indigenous communities in Brazil . 
He came down with symptoms in recent days and initially declined to leave his village in a remote part of the state of Mato Grosso , according to Celso Correia Batista , who aids indigenous people . 
However , as his condition deteriorated and he needed oxygen to breathe , Aritana agreed to go to hospital , Batista said . 
Aritana and Batista set off on a 10 hour drive to a hospital in the small city of Canarana , in Mato Grosso . 
After performing a lung scan , they began looking for ways to get him to an ICU , but were unable to find a doctor willing to transport him by air . 
As a result , they decided on a risky nine hour car journey to Goiânia . 
Batista said they traveled with four 1,000 liter oxygen cylinders during the trip – two of which were " practically empty " – to keep the chief alive until he reached the hospital . 
On the way , Batista said , the cylinders were replaced by full ones in a quick pit stop . 
" Otherwise we would have lost him , " he said . 
After arriving in Goiânia at 1.30am ( BRT ) on Wednesday , Aritana had to wait 30 minutes outside the hospital as he had not traveled with any documents . 
" His condition is serious , but he has every chance of survival , " said Batista .
