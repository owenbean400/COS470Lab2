The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks , two days after the South American nation became the world No . 
2 hot spot for coronavirus cases . 
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the US , but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the new countries .

Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections , while the US has over 1.6 million .

" We hope that ’ll be temporary , but because of the situation in Brazil , we ’re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people , " O ’Brien said .
