The head of the Beirut Bar Association warned today that a coronavirus outbreak in crisis hit Lebanon â€™s largest and most overcrowded prison amounted to a " humanitarian time bomb " . 
Security authorities on Saturday announced 22 coronavirus cases at the Roumieh prison , just outside Beirut , including 13 detainees and nine guards . 
They said the prisoners had been transferred to an isolation unit inside the jail . 
" The virus inside the Roumieh prison is tantamount to a humanitarian time bomb , " Beirut Bar Association head Melhem Khalaf told AFP . 
The prison houses more than 4,000 prisoners , around three times its intended capacity , and has long been infamous for the poor conditions in some of its blocks . 
Footage allegedly smuggled out of the prison and shared widely on social media shows several men lying on thin mattresses just feet apart from each other along a narrow corridor .
