Panama has lifted a five month old coronavirus measure that restricted women from going out one day and men the next , the Associated Press reports . 
The rules limiting when people can could go out for essentials proved controversial because it led to harassment and discrimination against transgender people . 
The health minister , Luis Antonio Sucre , urged caution despite the lifting of the rule , which had been in place since March . 
" Today we are beginning a new stage , " Sucre said , " in which men and women can go out when they wish . 
We have to be very careful , we have to remember that the pandemic is not over . " 
Panama has had 101,745 reported cases and 2,166 deaths . 
Similar measures were also tried in Peru as a way to reduce the number of people on the street and slow the spread of the virus .
