Indigenous protesters on key Brazilian grain highway BR 163 temporarily lifted their roadblock on Tuesday to allow a long line of trucks carrying corn to pass , but said they will stop traffic again in late afternoon . 
Members of the Kayapó tribe had blocked the route in center west Brazil on Monday with tires and wooden planks , protesting against a lack of government protection from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed several of their elders . 
That jammed up loaded trucks for 3 kilometers . 
The highway links towns in the nation ’s biggest farm state Mato Grosso to the port of Miritituba , an important export river gateway in Pará state . 
With the soy season almost over , the main grain transported on the road at present is corn . 
Highway police in Santarém confirmed that the tribe had lifted their blockade and planned to restore their barriers at 6pm ( 21.00 GMT ) when a court order was due to arrive . 
A judge issued a ruling on Monday ordering the demonstrators to unblock the road in the region of Novo Progresso , southern Pará state . 
Kayapó men carrying wooden weapons and wearing warrior body paint and headdresses told a Reuters photographer that they would continue their protest because no authority had come to hear their demands . 
They were also protesting against the so called Ferrogrão railway , set to cross part of the Amazon to connect grain producing Mato Grosso state to river ports for soy and corn . 
The railway will run parallel to the BR 163 highway , which has become an important route for exporting grains to the river ports for transshipment onto larger ships on the Amazon river . 
The Kayapo , who live on the adjacent Menkragnoti e Baú indigenous reservations , claim the road has brought illness to their villages and are seeking reparation money .
