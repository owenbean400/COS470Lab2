Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro visited health minister Eduardo Pazuello , who has Covid 19 , and made his point that the disease is easy to recover quickly from with the help of the controversial drug chloroquine . 
The two men chatted and joked without wearing masks in Pazuello ’s hotel room , seen in a video posted on social media by the president , who recovered from a bout of Covid 19 in July . 
Bolsonaro , who has minimised the gravity of the coronavirus and opposed lockdown measures by governors and mayors in Brazil , used the meeting to advocate the early use of anti malaria drug chloroquine , even though scientists say it is no cure and in clinical trials chloroquine and the related drug hydroxychloroquine have failed to show a benefit in treating Covid 19 . 
" This is another concrete case of someone who took chloroquine and it worked , " Bolsonaro said . 
" This is an alternative , when doctors prescribe it . " 
Pazuello , an active duty army general , said he felt tired on Sunday , but went to work on Monday and felt worse that night , with headaches and fever . 
He was diagnosed with Covid 19 the next day . 
With Pazuello , roughly half of Bolsonaro ’s 23 member Cabinet have now caught Covid 19 , besides the president and the first lady .
