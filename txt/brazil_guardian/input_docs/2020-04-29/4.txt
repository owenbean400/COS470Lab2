Slovenia is to lift a restriction prohibiting citizens from traveling outside their local community , the prime minister Janez Janša has said . 
The country has confirmed 1,418 cases and 89 deaths . 
Janša thanked citizens for following restrictions that have been imposed from the middle of March and told them : Thanks to you Slovenia is the most successful ( in curbing the virus ) among all neighbours of the focal country Italy . 
He claimed that Slovenia is also among countries that have suffered less economic and social damage than most due to the government ’s quick response , which included financial help of about € 3bn ( £ 2.6bn ) or some 6 % of GDP to companies and citizens hurt by the epidemics . 
He said more restrictions will be lifted on Monday but gave no details . 
The government said earlier hairdressers and beauty parlours , as well as outdoor bars and restaurants and a number of shops , will be able to open from Monday . 
Libraries and museums are also expected to open on Monday .
