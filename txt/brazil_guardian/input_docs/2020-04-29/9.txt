In the Amazon city of Manaus , where the overloaded health system has collapsed , reports from Yahoo News said many people were dying at home without being tested and others in ambulances as they drove around the city looking for beds in intensive care . 
Relatives of some victims were even opening the sealed coffins of relatives being buried in mass graves to ensure they were really inside . 
Talking privately , one Manaus doctor working in the public health sector said there are about 100 people on the waiting list for intensive care beds . 
Hospitals are also struggling to remove bodies . 
There â€™s no room and nowhere to put them . 
The refrigerated containers fill up occasionally . 
In Rio de Janeiro , a doctor also speaking anonymously said one hospital was running out of sedatives and neuromuscular blockers used for intubating and managing intubated patients . 
Local media has published photos of the vertical structures cemeteries are building to stack coffins up to eight high .
