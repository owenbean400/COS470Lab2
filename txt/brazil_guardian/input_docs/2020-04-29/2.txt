Venezuela is asking the Bank of England to sell part of the South American nation ’s gold reserves held in its coffers and send the proceeds to the United Nations to help with the country ’s pandemic efforts , Reuters is reporting . 
The agency cites two sources with knowledge of the situation . 
For decades , Venezuela has stored gold that makes up part of its central bank reserves in the vaults of foreign financial institutions . 
That included the Bank of England , which provides gold custodian services to many developing countries . 
But , since 2018 , the Bank has refused to transfer the 31 tonnes of gold to the government of the president Nicolás Maduro , whom the UK has refused to recognise as the country ’s legitimate leader after his disputed 2018 re election . 
Reuters reports that the effort signals Maduro is desperately seeking financial resources around the world as the country ’s economy struggles under low oil prices , crippling U.S . sanctions and a paralysing quarantine .
