Bolivia will extend its lockdown against the pandemic until 10 May , the government has announced , though it is planning to relax rules in less affected parts of the country from the following day . 
The president Jeanine Áñez has said Bolivia will move to a " dynamic " or " less rigid " quarantine on 11 May , allowing some people to return to work . 
Future policy will hinge on the country ’s success at containing the pandemic , which has killed 55 Bolivians so far with a total 1,053 cases confirmed . 
Opening the quarantine a little or closing it completely will depend on how the pandemic is being controlled in each region . 
The Ministry of Health will evaluate every seven days how the pandemic evolves in each region . 
On that basis , decisions will be taken to relax or harden the quarantine .
