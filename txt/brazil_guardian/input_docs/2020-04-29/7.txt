Another 31 people have died in Ireland and 376 more cases have been diagnosed , the country â€™s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said . 
One of the deaths reported on Wednesday involved a person in the 15-24 age group , the second in this category . 
Dr Holohan warned the number in intensive care units was too high as the prospect of a rapid easing of movement restrictions dwindles . 
That is simply too high and we need to get that down further not only because it is about protecting occupancy but the lower the figure is it is a reflection of better protection of the public and lower levels of spread of the infection .
