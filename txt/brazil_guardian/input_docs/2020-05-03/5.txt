South Africa ’s mining union has announced it has won a court case against the government that will force authorities to impose strict guidelines on mining companies to protect workers against Covid 19 . 
The union said in a statement on Facebook that it was " truly elated " with the court ’s ruling on Friday . 
" Now the lives and livelihoods of mineworkers can be protected , " South Africa ’s Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union ( AMCU ) president Joseph Mathunjwa said . 
South Africa , the world ’s largest platinum , manganese and chrome ore producer which has recorded 6,336 cases of the coronavirus , of whom 123 have died , is letting its mines run at half capacity during a national lockdown . 
But AMCU filed the court action to demand national safety standards for mines , including sanitisation procedures and minimum level of protective gear , before they go back to work . 
The miners fear being infected because social distancing is near impossible inside deep mine shafts . 
Workers in deep mines in Peru have also pushed back against returning to work without adequate protective gear and proper information about cases at sites . 
Such resistance could also spread to Chile , Burkina Faso , the United States and other countries , where mine workers are making similar demands .
