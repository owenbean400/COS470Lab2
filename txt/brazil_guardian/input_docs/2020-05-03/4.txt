Coronavirus test kits used in Tanzania have been dismissed as faulty by President John Magufuli because he said they had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw . 
Magufuli , whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away , said the kits had " technical errors " . 
The Covid 19 testing kits had been imported from abroad , Magufuli said during an event in Chato in the north west of Tanzania , although he did not give further details . 
The president said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits . 
They had randomly obtained several non human samples , including from a pawpaw , a goat and a sheep , but had assigned them human names and ages . 
These samples were then submitted to Tanzania â€™s laboratory to test for the coronavirus , with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins .
