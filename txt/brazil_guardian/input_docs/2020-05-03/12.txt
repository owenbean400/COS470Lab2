Healthcare staff working outside the NHS or on temporary contracts have had less access to coronavirus tests , a survey suggests . 
The Royal College of Nursing ( RCN ) UK wide survey of more than 22,000 health and care workers was conducted over the weekend before the government â€™s announcement of testing expansion . 
At that time , 76 % of all those surveyed said they had not been offered a test . 
Of those , 44 % said they did not know how to access testing . 
The RCN also found more than four in five temporary staff had not been offered Covid 19 testing , compared to three quarters of permanent staff . 
The survey found 79 % of those working outside of the NHS had not been offered a test , compared with 75 % in the health service . 
It found that in care homes and prisons , about 50 % did not know how to access tests . 
With temporary staff , this figure was 60 % . 
Of the staff who were offered testing , 90 % were able to access it .
