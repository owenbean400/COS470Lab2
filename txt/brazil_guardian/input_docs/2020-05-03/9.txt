More than 2,000 rural migrant workers blocked from returning home pelted Indian police with stones , officials in Gujarat said , as millions more stranded in the state readied to return to villages . 
Poor migrant workers across the country lost their jobs during the world ’s biggest pandemic lockdown , which began in late March to guard against the spread of new coronavirus . 
Saturday ’s clash in western India ’s Gujarat is the latest in a spate of such protests across India . 
It happened when officials stopped the workers , who had rented vehicles , from crossing into neighbouring Madhaya Pradesh , Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh states , because they did not have sufficient paperwork for entry , officials told AFP .
