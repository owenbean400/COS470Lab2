Self employed people have claimed they are " falling through the cracks " after new measures were announced on Friday to bolster the Jobs Support Scheme , PA news agency reports . 
Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that workers in pubs , restaurants and other businesses which are forced to close under new coronavirus restrictions will have two thirds of their wages paid by the government , up to a maximum of 2,100 a month . 
Ministers will also increase cash grants to businesses in England which have been legally required to close , while a 1.57bn fund for the creative industries was launched . 
With no change to the support for self employed people , however , freelancers have expressed that their finances throughout the pandemic have been a " struggle " . 
Campaigners believe as many as three million freelance and self employed workers have been unable to claim on the government â€™s support schemes due to various restrictions .
