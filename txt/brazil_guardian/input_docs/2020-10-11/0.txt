Demand for food relief has risen by 47 % on average during Covid 19 , Australian charities say , with the trend driven by growing numbers of international students and casual workers asking for help . 
In a report to be released on Monday , Foodbank surveyed about 500 charities once a month between April and September , as well as 1,000 Australians aged 18 and older who had experienced food insecurity in the past 12 months . 
Despite the doubling of the jobseeker payment and the introduction of the jobkeeper subsidy , Foodbank said casual workers and international students were among two " newly food insecure groups emerging as a result of the pandemic " .
