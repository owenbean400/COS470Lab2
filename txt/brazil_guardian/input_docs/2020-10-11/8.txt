Dr Anthony Fauci , the US ’s top infectious disease expert , responded to his misleading appearance in a new ad for Donald Trump ’s campaign , saying that he was taken out of context by the spot . 
In the ad , Fauci can be heard saying " I ca not imagine that … anyone could be doing more " . 
The expert , however , was referring to the efforts of federal public health officials – not the president . 
More on this over on the US blog .
