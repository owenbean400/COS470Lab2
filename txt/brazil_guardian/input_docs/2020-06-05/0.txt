Brazil â€™s president Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) unless it stops being a " partisan political organisation . " 
In comments to journalists broadcast on CNN Brasil , Bolsonaro also said hydroxychloroquine " is back " after " sham " studies regarding its efficacy were retracted . 
Bolsonaro has touted the drug as a treatment for the novel coronavirus despite a lack of scientific evidence about its effectiveness . 
The Lancet paper that halted global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid 19 because of fears of increased deaths was retracted on Thursday after a Guardian investigation found inconsistencies in the data .
