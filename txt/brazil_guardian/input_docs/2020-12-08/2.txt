Mexico plans to begin vaccinating its people against Covid 19 at the end of the third week of December , starting with health workers , the government announced Tuesday . 
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the vaccines will be " universal and free " — and also voluntary — and he hopes the full population will be vaccinated by the end of 2021 . 
Officials said that starting in February , those over 60 will receive vaccinations , followed by those over 50 in April and over 40 in May . They urged people with risk factors to get vaccinated first . 
The 67 year old president himself said he would get vaccinated in February , along with his age group . 
The government already has contracted for 34.4 million doses of the Pfizer Bio NTech vaccine and it said earlier that 250,000 of those are expected to arrive around 17 December . 
The armed forces will distribute them to vaccination sites , initially in Mexico City and the northern border state of Coahuila . 
Mexico has reported 1.18 million confirmed infections with the new coronavirus and at least 110,074 deaths from Covid 19 , though both are acknowledged to be undercounts .
