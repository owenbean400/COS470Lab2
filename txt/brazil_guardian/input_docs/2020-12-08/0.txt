The number of cases rose by 4,262 cases to 358,568 , it said . 
The government also plans to order restaurants , shops and markets to close at 7pm through 20 January in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus . 
It also aims to restrict the number of people who could meet in households to five . 
" The number of new infections is high and is rising again , beds in intensive care units are stretched , " the government said .

After getting feedback from the cantons , the Swiss government plans to meet again on Friday , ahead of a decision on the new measures due to start at the weekend . 
" The numbers are increasing exponentially - too quickly and too strongly . 
We want reduce contact and the number of infections , " Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga said . 
" If we do not act quickly enough , the worst of the pandemic is still to come , " she added .
