Tens of thousands of impoverished migrant workers are on the move across India , walking on highways and railway tracks or riding in trucks , buses and crowded trains in blazing heat , Associated Press reports . 
Some are accompanied by pregnant wives and young children , braving threats from the coronavirus pandemic . 
They say they have been forced to leave cities and towns where they had toiled for years building homes and roads after they were abandoned by their employers casualties of a nationwide lockdown to stop the virus from spreading . 
On Saturday , at least 23 laborers died in northern India when a truck they were traveling in smashed into a stationary truck on a highway . 
Last week , a train crashed into a group of tired workers who fell asleep on the tracks while walking back home in western Maharashtra state , killing 16 . 
The government and charities have tried to set up shelters for them , but their numbers are simply overwhelming , leaving them little choice but to head on a perilous journey home .
