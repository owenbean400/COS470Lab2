Questions have begun . 
Trump is asked whether he heard from any governors today that they are ready to re open . 
He did , Trump replies . 
There will be " good news " in the next few days , Trump says . 
Trump says he spoke to the commissioners of " every sport " yesterday , which seems far fetched . 
He ’s talking about whether sporting venues can be re opened - Dr Fauci has just spoken about this saying eventually it will be possible – in phase 3 – but not at the same time for everyone . 
Trump echoes this , but in a less measured way : Trump : I spoke to sports commissioners , and many of them will start without fans ; 
" Made for television . 
The good ole days . " 
(?) He says there 'll then be space between fans ; then , " when the virus is gone , we 'll be back to normal . " 
( We have not heard this stuff from the commishes )
