Dr Deborah Birx , Coronavirus Response Coordinator , is speaking now ( so far , this morning ’s briefing has been fairly tame – compared to the extraordinary performances from Trump seen earlier this week ) . 
Pence spoke just before Dr Birx – this was the gist : Pence : We made clear to governors that these guidelines can be implemented statewide or county by county .
