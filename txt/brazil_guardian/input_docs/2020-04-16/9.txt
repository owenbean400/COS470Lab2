Trump is asked about the thousands of protesters in cars and on foot who have flouted Michigan ’s stay at home orders to demand the state reopened . 
Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer was the main target of armed pro Trump protesters , with some chanting ‘ lock her up ’ on the steps of Lansing ’s town hall . 
Whitmer responded hours after the protest saying she understood the frustration but the ‘ sad irony ’ about the demonstration was that it could have further spread the virus and therefore created the need to extend Michigan ’s stay at home order . 
So far , 1,900 Michigan residents have died due to the coronavirus . 
Trump ’s response : JON KARL : Should not the anti stay at home protesters in Michigan listen to local authorities ? TRUMP : " I think they 're listening . 
I think they listen to me . 
They seem to be protesters that like me . "
