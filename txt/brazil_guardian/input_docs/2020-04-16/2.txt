Dr Birx says the task force will be doing " sentinel surveillance " in nursing homes , inner city clinics , and indigenous populations to find early alerts for asymptomatic and syndromic cases . 
As far as I ’m able to understand it at the moment , sentinel surveillance means testing and other measures to ensure early detection among vulnerable populations . 
But it ’s not immediately clear : me listening to Dr . Birx talking about " sentinel surveillance " and " syndromic surveillance "
