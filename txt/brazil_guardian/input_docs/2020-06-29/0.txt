Canada is over the worst of the coronavirus outbreak but a spike in cases in the United States and elsewhere shows Canadians must remain vigilant as the economy reopens , prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday . 
" After a very challenging spring things are continuing to move in the right direction , " Trudeau told a daily briefing . 
By contrast , some southern US states are reporting huge jumps in daily cases . 
Authorities in Mexico , Brazil and Russia are also struggling to control outbreaks . 
" What the situation we â€™re seeing in the United States and elsewhere highlights for us is that even as our economy is reopening , we need to make sure we are continuing to remain vigilant , " Trudeau said . 
The province of Alberta , home to the world*s third largest oil reserves , said it would accelerate a corporate tax cut and invest C$10 billion ( $ 7.31 billion ) in infrastructure projects to jump start its spluttering economy . 
Canadian medical officials released their latest forecasts on Monday , showing the number of overall deaths could be between 8,545 and 8,865 by 12 July . 
The current death toll is 8,522 . 
The United States and Canada have banned non essential travel between the two nations . 
The measures are due to expire on 21 July , and Trudeau said discussions were taking place about what to do next . 
He also said Ottawa had the fiscal room to respond if a second wave of the coronavirus struck later this year .
