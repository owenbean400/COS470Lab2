Brazil ’s supreme court has given the country ’s health minister 48 hours to set the starting date for a national vaccination program to fight the world ’s second deadliest outbreak of coronavirus . 
A member of the court ordered health minister Eduardo Pazuello to tell the country when the plan to vaccinate against Covid 19 announced on Saturday will be launched , the court said in a statement . 
President Jair Bolsonaro ’s right wing government has been criticised by state governors and public health experts for being unprepared to deal with the pandemic and coming up with a hastily put together and deficient plan . 
The plan sets an initial goal of vaccinating a quarter of the population , in the first half of 2021 , but it does not say when it will go into effect . 
Priority will be given to the most vulnerable such as health workers , elderly people and indigenous communities .
