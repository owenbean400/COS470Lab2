Brazil ’s far right president , Jair Bolsonaro , is continuing to play down the pandemic , saying it is " not all it ’s being made out to be " and denying that any hospital in the country has reached its full capacity due to the outbreak . 
Speaking to church ministers outside his official residence in Brasilia , he has urged state governors not to be so " radical , " warning that their confinement and quarantine measures are taking a heavy toll on the economy . 
He estimated that 60 % to 70 % of Brazilians will eventually contract the virus .
