Peru is poised to surpass 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus as concerns about a potential second wave of infections begin to grow in the hard hit Andean nation . 
The country had logged 998,475 cases as of Monday , and 37,173 deaths . 
The daily tally of new cases in Peru has fallen sharply in recent months , from a peak of 10,000 cases per day at the end of August to about 1,000 new infections on Monday . 
But many in Peru fear the country â€™s ailing healthcare system and overcrowded hospitals would struggle to revive amid another rise in cases . 
That concern has prompted authorities to implement restrictions around the year end holidays to ward off a second outbreak . 
" Right now we are not experiencing a second wave , but we are taking these measures to be [ vigilant ] , " the health minister , Pilar Mazzetti , said . 
Peru is lagging behind some of its neighbours in efforts to ensure vaccines for its citizens . 
The country has signed a preliminary agreement with Pfizer to buy 9.9m doses of its vaccine , and has inked a deal with the Covax Facility , an alliance led by the World Health Organization , to acquire another 13.2m doses . 
But the government of president Francisco Sagasti said last week it did not know when the first doses would be arriving , nor how many would be included in the first shipment . 
Latin American regional neighbours Brazil , Argentina , Colombia and Mexico have each exceeded 1 million cases of the virus .
