Brazil ’s total number of confirmed deaths has now overtaken the WHO ’s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America ’s biggest country . 
On Tuesday , the Brazilian health ministry reported 474 deaths over the previous 24 hours , taking the total to 5,017 – more than China , where the virus was first reported and which has seen 4,643 deaths so far , according to the WHO . 
Brazil now has 71,886 confirmed cases after adding 5,385 in the last 24 hours , though widespread underreporting and a generalised lack of tests means numbers are almost definitely much higher . 
The G1 news site reported on Tuesday that deaths in São Paulo are 168 % more than the official number of 2,049 .
