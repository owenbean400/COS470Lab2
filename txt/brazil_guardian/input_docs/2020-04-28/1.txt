Doctors on the frontline also widely believe that the real numbers are much higher – one factor being people dying at home . 
Speaking on condition of anonymity , one medic in Rio de Janeiro state said three patients who were intubated after testing positive using faster , less accurate serological tests died during his overnight shift last weekend at a public hospital in the town of Nova Iguaçu . 
If one doctor saw this ( in one night ) I think it ’s unlikely the number for the whole of Brazil is 474 .
