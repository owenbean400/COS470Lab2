Nigeria will resume domestic flights from 8 July , the government has said , as Africa â€™s most populous country relaxes restrictions despite mounting cases and deaths . 
The airports for the capital Abuja and Lagos will open that day , while a handful of others are set to open three days later and the rest after another four days , the government said on its official Twitter account . 
No date was given for the resumption of international flights . 
Nigeria had confirmed more than 25,000 cases and almost 600 deaths as of Wednesday , with little sign of the outbreak slowing . 
Officials have expressed their concern that the outbreak there might become much worse . 
Yet the government is keenly aware of the economic toll , which has crushed the price of oil , on which Nigeria depends . 
Officials have steadily eased measures aimed at curbing the outbreak , believing the economic damage of a stringent lockdown could be worse than the harm done by the pandemic .
