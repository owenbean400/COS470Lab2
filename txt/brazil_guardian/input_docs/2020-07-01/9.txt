In the UK , the British Medical Association has criticised the government over reports that millions of items of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) were found to be faulty . 
The country ’s Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) has issued safety warnings , notices for disposal and distribution stoppages for some 85m masks and respirators , according to an investigation by Channel 4 News . 
The broadcaster reports that the masks and respirators were stored in the government ’s pandemic stockpile and have been distributed to hospitals , care homes and GP surgeries since March . 
Dr Chaand Nagpaul , the chairman of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) Council , said it was a " dereliction of duty " if healthcare workers had been supplied with faulty PPE during the epidemic . 
These reports , if true , are nothing short of a national scandal . 
If doctors and health and care workers have been supplied with , and worn , faulty , re dated masks , this is clearly a dereliction of duty to ensure the safety of NHS staff and patients . 
Wearing substandard PPE places doctors at risk of becoming infected and also spreading the illness to patients . 
We know that doctors and healthcare staff have become infected and died from this virus and therefore nothing short of 100 % fit for purpose PPE should have been supplied from the outset . 
A Department for Health and Social Care spokeswoman told the broadcaster : The quality of PPE released to the frontline is critically important to us . 
Rigorous checks were made to ensure products were safe before being distributed to the frontline and all products purchased for the stockpile in 2009 met the essential safety requirements required by law . 
As soon as we are alerted to any potential issues we take immediate action to ensure the safety of our health and care staff , and work to resolve those issues as quickly as possible .
