Alitalia has resumed international flights from Milan as Italy gradually reopens its airports to foreign travellers and scraps restrictions imposed to contain the outbreak . 
The carrier , which is in the process of being nationalised after 11 years of troubled private management , will fly from Milan Malpensa airport to Amsterdam , Brussels , Paris and London .
