Israel ’s parliament has voted to allow the country ’s domestic intelligence agency to track the cellphones of coronavirus carriers for the next three weeks amid a resurgence in new cases , Reuters reports . 
The Shin Bet surveillance technology has been used on and off to track carriers since March , when the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s cabinet circumvented parliament and approved the program through emergency regulations as cases first spiked . 
Those emergency measures drew challenges from privacy watchdog groups and the supreme court cited worries over dangers to individual liberty in demanding Netanyahu ’s government regulate the surveillance through legislation . 
The new law allows the Shin Bet to access carriers ’ phone location data for 14 days before they were diagnosed . 
That data is used to identify anyone they came into contact with , which proponents say is crucial to identify new cases .
