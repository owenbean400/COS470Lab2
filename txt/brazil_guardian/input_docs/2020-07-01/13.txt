The response here is very , very Australian . 
Some context : Melbourne , Australia â€™s second largest city , has seen a spike in community transmission cases ( albeit from a very low base ) so 10 suburbs across the city have been forced back into lockdown . 
But the measure has had some perverse outcomes , including in Summerhill Road , where one side of the street is locked down , the other is not . 
As our interlocutor here says : " what a stitch up " . 
" What a bloody stitch up ! " says Cal , when he learns his neighbours across the street wo not be forced to stay at home . 
" Mate , the other side is Footscray , they are not locked down ! " he calls out to his roommates . by @ Matilda Boseley
