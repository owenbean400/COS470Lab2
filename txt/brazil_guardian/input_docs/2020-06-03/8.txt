Unrest has swept across the United States since George Floyd , a 46 year old black man , was killed in custody of Minneapolis police . 
Since then , protests have swelled in dozens of towns and cities across the country . 
Tens of thousands of people have been standing shoulder to shoulder as they protest against the killing of George Floyd , after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes despite his cries that he could not breathe . 
But the public health emergency that engulfed the nation â€“ Sars Cov 2 , the virus which causes Covid 19 - has not disappeared . 
Where are cases of coronavirus increasing ? 
More cases are being detected in a number of southern states , including Alabama , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina and Tennessee . 
But cases are not increasing only in southern states . 
Alaska , Montana and California have also seen cases increase . 
In total , 17 states are seeing increases . 
These increases reflect infections that may have taken place weeks ago . 
The novel coronavirus has a long incubation period , and people may not get tested until they feel ill .
