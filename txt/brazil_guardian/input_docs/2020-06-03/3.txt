The crisis is an opportunity for " a new beginning " , Italy ’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has said , as he outlines plans for the country ’s economic recovery . 
" The acute phase of the health emergency is behind us but now we have to deal with the economic emergency , " Conte said , adding that Italy had earmarked € 80bn ( £ 71.4bn ) worth of measures to help companies and workers affected by the lockdown . 
Conte admitted that there have been " delays " in people receiving social benefits , due to the " state apparatus " not being prepared . 
" But we will improve , " he promised . 
The aims of Italy ’s " recovery plan " over the next few months include investing in infrastructure , relaunching public and private investments , ensuring broadband availability across the country and encouraging electronic payments to tackle the shadow economy . 
Conte said the justice and taxation systems also needed to be reformed . 
Restrictions on inter regional travel were lifted on Wednesday and borders opened up to European travellers as Italy tries to revive tourism , a sector crucial to its national economy . 
The further easing of restrictions coincides with the sustained fall in deaths and infections since 4 May , when construction and manufacturing activity across the country resumed . 
Italy registered 71 news deaths on Wednesday , up from 55 on Tuesday , and 321 new infections , compared to 318 on Tuesday . 
However , Conte warned citizens to maintain physical distancing and wear face masks . 
The numbers are encouraging and we deserve to smile after months of sacrifice … but the virus has not disappeared .
