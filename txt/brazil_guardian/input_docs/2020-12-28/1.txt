The Brazilian president , Jair Bolsonaro , said a Covid 19 vaccine would be available in the country within five days of being approved by federal health regulator Anvisa . 
The president told journalists the health ministry would only buy a vaccine with a strong recommendation from Anvisa and it would be distributed equally among Brazil â€™s states . 
Bolsonaro , who was infected with Covid 19 in July , has sought to downplay the severity of the virus and said he will not agree to be vaccinated .
