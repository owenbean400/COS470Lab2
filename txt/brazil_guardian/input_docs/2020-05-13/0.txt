Brazilian media outlets have published the results of negative coronavirus tests taken by the country ’s president Jair Bolsonaro following a Supreme Court ruling . 
The result backs up the president ’s previous claim of a clean bill of health , but doubts lingered over the results after it was revealed that the three tests also were carried out nearly two months ago – since when Bolsonaro has repeatedly flouted social distancing advice and mixed with crowds of supporters and ordinary Brazilians . 
The tests were performed on 12 , 17 and 18 March , the O Globo newspaper reported . 
In the following weeks , Bolsonaro greeted demonstrators and ordinary Brazilians without a mask , posed for selfies , visited a supermarket and a bakery and even shook hands with an elderly woman after wiping his nose on his wrist . 
Last weekend he rode a jet ski and stopped by a floating barbecue . 
Bolsonaro initially refused to release his tests results after 23 people who were on his trip to the United States in March tested positive . 
He has dismissed the rising Covid 19 death toll in Brazil with a casual " so what ? " 
Brazil ’s Health Ministry reported a record 881 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday night and the country has 177,589 confirmed cases . 
In March , Bolsonaro said his athletic background meant that , if he did catch Covid 19 , he would barely feel it . 
Yet his government turned down a Freedom of Information request from the UOL news site , arguing the information was " secret " . 
The tests were made public on Wednesday by the Supreme Court judge Ricardo Lewandowski following a request from the Estado de S . Paulo newspaper . 
It won rulings in lower courts but was overruled by a High Court judge . 
Lewandoski overturned that decision .
