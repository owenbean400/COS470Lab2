Standing in a graveyard on the outskirts of Mexico City , guitar player Eberardo Vargas this week had fewer funerals to play at than he has for most of the coronavirus pandemic , Reuters reports . 
Even as Mexico approaches a grim new milestone in its battle with the pandemic - 60,000 fatalities - signs of relief are beginning to emerge in the country that has registered more dead than any other bar the United States and Brazil . 
Vargas , 49 , said May , June and July were the busiest months he could recall as a musician as mourners in the municipality of Ecatepec northeast of Mexico City paid him and his band to hear favorite songs of lost loved ones during their last goodbyes . 
But that demand has eased lately as public life gradually returns to normal in the sprawling Mexican capital , prompting the government to declare this week that the coronavirus scourge is in " sustained decline " in Mexico . 
" We sometimes had 10 or 15 performances a day at the peak of the pandemic , but it ’s come down , " he said , who had little to do at the Ecatepec graveyard for much of Friday . 
" Now , it ’s more like three , or sometimes five . " 
Deaths due to coronavirus are on track to hit their lowest weekly total for two months , and new cases have eased since reaching a record daily number at the start of August . 
" Our whole band used to wait here , there was always work , " said Vargas . 
" Now , we take turns because it ’s become so quiet . " 
Still , the country is almost certain to cross the threshold of 60,000 dead this weekend . 
Earlier in the pandemic , Mexico ’s coronavirus czar and deputy health minister Hugo Lopez Gatell had cast such a figure as a " catastrophic " outcome . 
Despite the improving news , Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday there was no cause for complacency . 
" This week we lost some momentum in the trend of falling number of infections and hospitalisations , " she said .
