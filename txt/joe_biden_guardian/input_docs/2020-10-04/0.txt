His campaign said he tested negative for Covid twice on Friday . 
Bates said in the statement that Biden was not in close contact with Trump , his family members or his aides during their debate Tuesday night . 
Several people in Trump ’s orbit have tested positive in recent days .

At the same time , Trump has held large public rallies without requiring masks or enforcing social distancing .
