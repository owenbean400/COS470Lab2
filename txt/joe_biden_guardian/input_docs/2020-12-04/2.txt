More on US president elect Joe Biden ’s address , from AP : President elect Joe Biden says the Trump administration ’s plan for distributing an approved coronavirus vaccine to the public lacks important detail . 
Biden said Friday that " there ’s no detailed plan that we ’ve seen " for how to get vaccines out of a container , into syringes and into people ’s arms . 
He says more equitable distribution is also needed to get the vaccine into underserved communities , not just to drugstores and large retailers . 
Biden noted that Black people and Latinos are more likely to die of COVID 19 than white people are . 
Biden says the " equity side " is an important part of the process , too . 
He says he ’s working on an " overall plan " and adds that ’s why he asked government infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci to be part of Biden ’s Covid 19 team and to serve as his chief medical adviser . 
Fauci , the nation ’s chief infectious disease expert , says there was never a question that he would accept Biden ’s offer to serve . 
Fauci told NBC ’s Today show " I said yes right on the spot " after Biden asked him to serve during a conversation on Thursday . 
As the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , Fauci has served several presidents , Republican and Democratic . 
But during President Donald Trump ’s administration , he has been largely sidelined as Trump gave rosy assessments of the virus and insisted it would fade away . 
Fauci has urged rigorous mask wearing and social distancing , practices that have not often been followed at the White House . 
On Thursday , Biden said he will ask Americans to commit to 100 days of wearing masks as one of his first acts as president . 
" I told him I thought that was a good idea , " Fauci told NBC .
