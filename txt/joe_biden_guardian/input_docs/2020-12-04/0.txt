US President elect Joe Biden said Friday â€™s " grim " jobs report showed the economic recovery was stalling and warned the " dark winter " ahead would exacerbate the pain unless the US Congress passed a coronavirus relief bill immediately . 
Biden said in a statement : The situation requires urgent action . 
Americans need help and they need it now . " 
A government report earlier in the day showed the labour market slowing in November amid a surge of Covid 19 cases . 
Biden , the Democratic former vice president , offered support for an emerging bipartisan package of around $ 908bn that has drawn tentative support from members of both parties in Congress . 
But he said the bill would be " just the start " and vowed to press for additional relief once he takes office in January .
