White House scientific adviser Dr Deborah Birx warned the United States is entering a new " deadly phase " of the coronavirus pandemic , and urged an " aggressive " approach to containing its spread , Jessica Glenza reports . 
Birx gave the warning in a written memo delivered to top administration officials on Monday . 
It is a direct contradiction of one of Donald Trump ’s central , and false , closing campaign messages – that the US is " rounding the corner " on the pandemic . 
" We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic , " Birx wrote in the memo , first reported by the Washington Post . 
She continued : Cases are rapidly rising in nearly 30 % of all USA counties , the highest number of county hotspots we have seen with this pandemic . 
Half of the United States is in the red or orange zone for cases despite flat or declining testing . 
The memo came as Trump gathered hundreds at in person rallies in key swing states , and warned that his political rival Joe Biden would lock down the country again . 
" This is not about lockdowns – it has not been about lockdowns since March or April , " Birx said . 
" It ’s about an aggressive , balanced approach that is not being implemented . " 
Americans need " consistent messaging about uniform use of masks , physical distancing and hand washing , with profound limitation on indoor gatherings especially with family and friends , " she wrote .
