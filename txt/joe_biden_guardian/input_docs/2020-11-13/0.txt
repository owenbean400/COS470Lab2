Joe Biden ’s win in the US election is raising hopes in Latin America that a war over medical supplies at the start of the COVID 19 outbreak will not be repeated once vaccines are approved for use , Chile ’s health minister told Reuters . 
Enrique Paris said he believed Biden ’s leadership would allow for countries to present a more " united " front against the pandemic , avoiding the commercial battles by nations including the United States to secure ventilators , masks and personal protective equipment seen earlier this year . 
" There was a trade war in which those who could pay more got more and those who could take things out of or even rupture distribution chains did so , " Paris told Reuter . 
" It was horrible and I hope it does not happen again , " Paris said . 
" I believe that Mr Biden has another vision of what is diplomacy and global understanding between countries . "
