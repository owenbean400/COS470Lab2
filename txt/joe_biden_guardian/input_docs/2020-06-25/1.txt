In his speech on healthcare , Joe Biden also criticised President Trump for calling coronavirus testing a " double edged sword " during his Saturday rally in Tulsa . 
" Testing unequivocally saves lives , and widespread testing is the key to opening up our economy again — so that ’s one edge of the sword , " Biden said in Pennsylvania . 
" The other edge : that he thinks finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad . 
And that ’s what he ’s worried about . 
He ’s worried about looking bad . " 
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also urged Americans to socially distance and wear masks to limit the spread of coronavirus . 
" We ’re going to have to wear masks . 
And I know as Americans it ’s not something we ’re used to . 
But it matters , " Biden said . 
" We ’re going to have to socially distance . 
It ’s not easy . 
It seems so strange to us . ... 
But for now , we have to socially distance . 
It matters . "
