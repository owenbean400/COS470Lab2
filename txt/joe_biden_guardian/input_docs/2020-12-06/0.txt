Businesses that made fortunes selling PPE during the UK ’s Covid 19 crisis should be taxed to fund a £ 500 bonus for frontline workers who are facing burnout , a thinktank has said . 
" Pandemic profiteers " , including the online retailer Amazon , which saw sales soar in lockdown , should pay a 0.5 % sales levy , according to the RSA , which is warning that 49 % of frontline staff think they will soon burn out , including 63 % of NHS staff . 
The thinktank ’s suggestion of a " new deal " for key workers , including a £ 500 thank you bonus , extended sick pay and paying the real living wage , follows the lead of the US president elect , Joe Biden , who has promised to give workers at a range of employers – from hospitals to supermarkets – an emergency pay boost . 
Last week , the Scottish first minister , Nicola Sturgeon , announced £ 500 a head bonuses for Scotland ’s 300,000 health and social care workers .
