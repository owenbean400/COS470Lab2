The US president elect Joe Biden on Monday received his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine on live television as part of a growing effort to convince the American public the inoculations are safe . 
The president elect took a dose of Pfizer vaccine at a hospital near his Delaware home , hours after his wife Jill Biden . 
The injections came the same day that a second vaccine , produced by Moderna , will start arriving in states . 
" I ’m ready , " said Biden , who was administered the dose at a hospital in Newark , Delaware , and declined the option to count to three before the needle was inserted into his left arm . 
I ’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it ’s available to take the vaccine . 
There ’s nothing to worry about . 
Other top government officials last week joined the first wave of Americans to be inoculated against Covid 19 as part of the largest largest vaccination campaign in the nation ’s history . 
The vice president Mike Pence , the house speaker Nancy Pelosi , the Senate majority leader Mitch Mc Connell and other lawmakers were given doses on Friday . 
They chose to publicise their injections as part of a campaign to convince Americans that the vaccines are safe and effective amid skepticism , especially among Republicans . 
The vice president elect Kamala Harris and her husband are expected to receive their first shots next week .
