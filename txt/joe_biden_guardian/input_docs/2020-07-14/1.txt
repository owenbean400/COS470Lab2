US president Donald Trump is delivering a prepared campaign speech at the White House Rose Garden currently . 
My colleagues on the US blog are covering that live – and it is mostly an attack on Joe Biden and the Democrats – but here is a coronavirus related fact check by my colleague Maanvi Singh : Trump : " Think of this : If we did not do testing — instead of testing over 40 million people , if we did half the testing we ’d have half the cases . " 
Fact : This is an obvious one , but testing fewer Americans does not mean that we ’d have fewer coronavirus cases , we ’d just be reporting fewer of them . 
People with the infection who are not able to get tested could unknowingly spread the infection to others , exacerbating the crisis .
