As the next Democratic debate is about to begin , Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have sought to underscore the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic , while Trump consistently downplayed the health threat . 
Earlier this evening , at a White House press conference , Trump said the government has " tremendous control " over the virus . 
In contrast , Dr Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said moments later that the worst of the crisis was still yet to come in the US . 
In contrast , Joe Biden delivered a speech Thursday afternoon saying Americans need to take serious steps and listen to medical experts to help combat the virus . 
The coronavirus will not discriminate based on national origin , race , gender , or zip code . 
It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society . 
We need to take action to combat it . 
" We lead by science , " Biden said . 
" Downplaying it , being overly dismissive , or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease . " 
Bernie Sanders said in a Friday speech that the crisis demonstrated the need for the Medicare for all healthcare system he has championed , arguing the policy could save lives during the pandemic . 
" We cannot live in a nation where if you have the money you get the treatment you need to survive , but if you â€™re working class or poor , you get to the end of the line , " Sanders said . 
" In my view , the most cost effective way to reform our dysfunctional and cruel system is to move to a Medicare for all , single payer healthcare system . ... 
And I think in the midst of this crisis , more and more Americans understand the truth of that . " 
Our country is facing a medical and economic crisis the likes of which we 've not seen in generations . 
Our response must meet the enormous scale of the pandemic . 
Now is the time for solidarity , and robust action .
