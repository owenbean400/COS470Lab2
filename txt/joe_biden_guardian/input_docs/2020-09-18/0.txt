Joe Biden began his speech in Minnesota by talking about the importance of union jobs , but the Democratic nominee quickly pivoted to criticising Trump â€™s response to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Biden said if Trump had acted earlier to mitigate the spread of the virus , tens of thousands of Americans would not be dead and would instead be " sitting at the dinner table tonight " . 
During his press conference , the president was asked if he believes he knows better than the experts in his administration , after Trump contradicted the directors of the CDC and the FBI this week . 
" Yeah , in many cases , I do , " Trump replied .
