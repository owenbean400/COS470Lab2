An official study of patients in the US city Atlanta has found that black patients are more likely to be hospitalised than white patients , highlighting racial disparities in the country â€™s healthcare system . 
Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said about 79 % of black patients were hospitalised , against 13 % of white patients across six metropolitan hospitals and outpatient clinics between March and April 2020 . 
The researchers found such an association even when they controlled for underlying conditions such as diabetes . 
This suggested that other factors like healthcare access or the possibility of bias might explain the higher rates . 
Hospitalised patients tended to be older , male , black , and have underlying conditions , said the researchers . 
They added that black Americans were more likely to be frontline industry or essential workers , raising their risks for infection . 
Apart from age , race and underlying conditions , lack of insurance , smoking and obesity were independently associated with the likelihood of hospitalisation for the 531 Atlanta patients studied , researchers said .
