In the US , discrepancies in how different states are reporting testing and infection figures is causing " frustration and confusion " , AP reports . 
Elected officials , businesses and others are depending on coronavirus testing and infection rate data as states reopen so that they will know if a second wave of contagion is coming and whether another round of stay at home orders or closings might be needed . 
But states are reporting those figures in different ways , and that can lead to frustration and confusion about what the numbers mean . 
In some places , there have been data gaps that leave local leaders wondering whether they should loosen or tighten restrictions . 
In others , officials are accused of spinning the numbers to make their states look better and justify reopening . 
In a continuing theme for the outbreak in the United States , a lack of federal leadership persists . 
Even the U.S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been lumping together tests that measure different things . 
Such errors render the CDC numbers about how many Americans are infected uninterpretable , creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data , said Ashish Jha , director of Harvards Global Health Institute . 
" It is incumbent on health departments and the CDC to make sure they â€™re presenting information thats accurate . 
And if they cant get it , then do not show the data at all , " Jha said . 
" Faulty data is much , much worse than no data . "
