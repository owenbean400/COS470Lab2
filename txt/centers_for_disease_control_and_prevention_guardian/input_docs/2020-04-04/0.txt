Just shortly after Donald Trump undermined recommendations that Americans should wear masks , Melania Trump has urged people to " take social distancing & amp ; wearing a mask/face covering seriously " . 
As the weekend approaches I ask that everyone take social distancing & amp ; wearing a mask/face covering seriously . 
# COVID19 is a virus that can spread to anyone - we can stop this together . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) is now recommending Americans cover their faces when outside . 
But , at his daily press briefing , the US president Donald Trump said he would not be following the guidance . 
" I â€™m choosing not to do it , " he said , repeatedly noting that wearing non medical grade masks is a " voluntary " option .
