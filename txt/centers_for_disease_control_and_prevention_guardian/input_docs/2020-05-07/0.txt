A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) was abruptly shelved by the White House , according to AP News . 
The document includes step by step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal . 
The 17 page report was scheduled to be published on Friday but now the guidance " will never see the light of day , " a CDC official told AP . 
It urges businesses to slowly reopen while continuing to observe social distancing , while the president has pushed for a rapid reopening despite fears of a surge in coronavirus cases . 
The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak rather than the CDC , which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics .
