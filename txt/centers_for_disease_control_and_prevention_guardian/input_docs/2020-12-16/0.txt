Amazon has asked the US government to prioritise essential workers including its warehouse , grocery store and data centre staff for receipt of the Covid 19 vaccine , according to a letter seen by Reuters . 
The request underscores how the second biggest US private employer , with 800,000 workers in the US , views a vaccine as important to keeping its staff safe and its facilities open . 
The US National Retail Federation made a similar request on the industry ’s behalf Wednesday as well . 
Administration of the vaccine began on Monday in the US , following emergency use authorisation last week . 
Early doses have been set aside for healthcare workers and nursing home residents . 
Dave Clark , Amazon ’s senior vice president of worldwide operations , said the company supports giving the vaccine to healthcare professionals and that essential workers should come next , in line with a government vaccine playbook from October . 
His letter was addressed to the head of an advisory panel at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , called ACIP . 
" We request that ACIP continue to prioritise these essential workers who cannot work from home , like those working at Amazon fulfilment centres , AWS data centres and Whole Foods Market stores , to receive the Covid 19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time , " he wrote . 
Amazon owns the grocery chain Whole Foods and operates the cloud computing business AWS . 
The letter was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal [ paywall ] .
