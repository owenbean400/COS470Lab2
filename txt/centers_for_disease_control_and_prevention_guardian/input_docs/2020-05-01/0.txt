The US president Donald Trump has offered an increasingly bleak picture for the US , telling a White House event : Hopefully , we â€™re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost , which is a horrible number , nevertheless . 
Trump , who initially dismissed the outbreak as a " hoax " , has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as light as 60,000 or 70,000 . 
According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began .
