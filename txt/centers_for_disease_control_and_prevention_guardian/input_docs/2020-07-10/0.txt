Coronavirus deaths among Americans aged 65 years and younger are less common among white people than any other group , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported . 
Overall , 34.9 % of Hispanic patients who died were younger than 65 , while 29.5 % of people belonging to an ethnic group other than white who died were younger than 65 , compared to only 13.2 % of white , non Hispanic decedents , Reuters reported . 
Researchers analysed 10,647 deaths between 12 February and 24 April 2020 from 16 public health departments in 15 states . 
Most of the deaths were in New York City , as well as New Jersey and Washington states ; three areas hit early on . 
Most of those who died were older than 65 years and had underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes , according to the report in the CDC ’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . 
All ethnic groups other than white were disproportionately affected when compared to their share of the US population , the report said . 
While underlying medical conditions are known to be risk factors in coronavirus related deaths , researchers were not able to assess how race or ethnicity contributed . 
The researchers noted that a larger proportion of people of colour work in occupations or essential activities that do not allow physical distancing . 
In June , the US Department of Health and Human Services asked laboratories to report a patient ’s age and ethnicity along with Covid 19 test results , to better understand why the respiratory illness affects certain demographics more severely . 
While further studies are needed , the researchers said understanding factors contributing to mortality differences may help improve communication to encourage at risk groups to promptly seek care if they fall ill .
