A coronavirus test developed by a US diagnostics company will be available for healthcare providers to order later today . 
The US government is ramping up efforts to increase its ability to identify the coronavirus and an ongoing struggle to expand local testing has led to criticism . 
Health officials said earlier today they expect to deliver enough coronavirus tests to public laboratories this week to test about 400,000 people . 
Officials expect to ship additional test kits to cover up to 1.7m people by the end of next week , US health and human services secretary Alex Azar said . 
The news of Laboratory Corp of America Holdings ( Lab Corp ) tests comes as Quest Diagnostics and OPKO Health also said they would be able to begin testing for the virus from next week . 
The FDA has said it will allow some laboratories to immediately use the tests they have developed and validated while they await emergency use authorisation from the US health regulator . 
Co Diagnostics Inc said it was seeing a surge in demand for its coronavirus test kits following the FDA policy change . 
Previously , only testing kits developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , many of which were found to be faulty , could be used in public health labs , Reuters reported . 
Analysts at Evercore ISI expect the lab tests developed by Quest and Lab Corp to be priced around $ 45 to $ 50 , similar to a flu test .
