More than 1.5 million people have lost their lives due to Covid 19 with one death reported every nine seconds on a weekly average , as vaccinations are set to begin in December in a handful of developed nations . 
Reuters reports that half a million deaths occurred in just the last two months , indicating that the severity of the pandemic is far from over .

In the last week alone , more than 10,000 people in the world died on average every single day , which has been steadily rising each passing week . 
Many countries across the world are now fighting second and third waves even greater than the first , forcing new restrictions on everyday life . 
The coronavirus caused more deaths in the past year than tuberculosis in 2019 and nearly four times the number of deaths due to malaria , according to the World Health Organisation .
