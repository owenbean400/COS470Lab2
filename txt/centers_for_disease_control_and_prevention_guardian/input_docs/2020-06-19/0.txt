The Brazilian government on Friday published new guidelines for meatpackers after a spike of Covid 19 cases at food plants , including keeping workers at least one metre apart , but labour prosecutors criticized the steps as inadequate . 
No testing is required under the ministry of agriculture ’s new rules , which were issued after consultations with the labour prosecutor ’s office . 
A prosecutors ’ representative said the guidelines ignored key recommendations made by the office that specified minimum distancing of 1.5 metres between workers in common areas of the plant , as well as mass testing . 
The prosecutors ’ recommendations also addressed the quality of face masks required for use , physical distancing and testing protocols . 
The CDC in the US has recommended that meatpacking workers be spaced at least six feet ( two metres ) apart .
