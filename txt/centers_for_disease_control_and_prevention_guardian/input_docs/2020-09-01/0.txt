The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an order temporarily halting residential evictions on public health grounds . 
The order lasts through 31 December and applies to individual renters earning no more than $ 99,000 in annual income . 
The CDC said an eviction moratorium " can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease " like Covid 19 . 
Renters still owe rent and the order does not prevent the " charging or collecting of fees , penalties , or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis , " the CDC said . 
US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told a US House of Representatives panel earlier the measure was to ensure people " do not get thrown out of their rental homes " as a result of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Mnuchin said the actions affect about 40 million renters . 
He said Congress should still approve rental assistance . 
In July , a firm estimated more than $ 21.5bn in past due rent is owed by Americans . 
Over the spring and early summer , as unemployment surged to levels unseen since the aftermath of the 1930s Great Depression , a patchwork of federal , state and local eviction bans kept renters who could not make payments in homes . 
The Democratic controlled House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would extend enhanced jobless aid through January and allocated $ 100bn for rental assistance . 
It would also have extended the federal ban on evictions for up to one year . 
The bill has not been approved in the Senate .
