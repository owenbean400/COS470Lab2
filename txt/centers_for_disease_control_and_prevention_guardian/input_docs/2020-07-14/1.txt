Most people in the US wore cloth face coverings after Washington recommended it in April , an official study has suggested . 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) researchers analysed data from more than 800 adults in two internet surveys in April and May who reported going outdoors in the past week . 
Data published in CDC â€™s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report showed that , within days of the first national recommendation , 61.9 % people reported using cloth face coverings when they left home . 
This number rose to 76.4 % a month later . 
While more research is needed to understand why some people still do not wear cloth masks , the CDC said public health authorities should continue communicating the importance of covering the mouth and nose .
