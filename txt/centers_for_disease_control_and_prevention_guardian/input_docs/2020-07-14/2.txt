The rising number of cases in the US could be under control within four to eight weeks if everyone wore a mask , the director of the CDC has said . 
Robert Redfield was speaking in an online interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association , or JAMA , a medical publication . 
He also said wearing a mask was a public health issue and that he was " sad " to see it become politicised . 
I am glad to see the president and vice president wear a mask . 
Clearly , in their situation they could easily justify they do not need to ... but we need for them to set the example . 
The CDC said in a publication released on Tuesday that most Americans wore cloth face coverings after the government recommended their use in April .
