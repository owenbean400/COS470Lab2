The US Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) has published an advisory on its website recommending that " for the next 8 weeks , organisers ( whether groups or individuals ) cancel or postpone in person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States . " 
The note continues : The Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations , hand hygiene , and social distancing . 
When feasible , organisers could modify events to be virtual . 
This recommendation does not apply to the day to day operation of organisations such as schools , institutes of higher learning , or businesses .
