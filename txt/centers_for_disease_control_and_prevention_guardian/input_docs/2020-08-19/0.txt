American Indians and Alaska Natives have been hit harder by Covid 19 than the white US population and have been more likely to become infected by coronavirus at a younger age , a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report showed on Wednesday . 
The incidence of laboratory confirmed Covid 19 cases among people identified as American Indians or Alaska Natives was 3.5 times that of non Hispanic whites , making them one of the racial and ethnic minority groups at highest risk , according to the study based on data from 23 US states from 22 January to 3 July . 
The data also showed that those testing positive for coronavirus tended to be younger than white non Hispanic people with Covid 19 . 
The researchers found that 12.9 % of infections among American Indians or Alaska Natives were in people under age 18 , compared to 4.3 % among non Hispanic whites . 
The study added to a growing body of evidence that long standing health and social inequities have resulted in increased risk for infection and death from Covid 19 among American Indian and Alaska Native populations , the CDC researchers said . 
Other factors such as reliance on shared transportation , limited access to running water and household size could increase risk for virus transmission , the researchers added . 
" American Indian and Alaska Native people have suffered a disproportionate burden of Covid 19 illness during the pandemic , " CDC director Robert Redfield said in a statement . 
The CDC said it has provided $ 200 million in funding to support tribes and tribal organizations in carrying out Covid 19 preparedness and response activities .
