Meanwhile , AP reports , missing from the action has been the US president Donald Trump , who has spent the last week largely out of sight as he continues to stew about his election loss . 
Trump , who in the past has spread misinformation about vaccine risks , has not said when he intends to get the shot . 
He tweeted earlier this month that he was " not scheduled " to take it , but said he looked " forward to doing so at the appropriate time . " 
The White House has said he is still discussing timing with his doctors . 
Trump was hospitalised with Covid 19 in October and was given an experimental monoclonal antibody treatment that he credited for his swift recovery . 
A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory board has said people who received that treatment should wait at least 90 days to be vaccinated to avoid any potential interference . 
" When the time is right , I ’m sure he will remain willing to take it , " White House spokesperson Brian Morgenstern said on Friday . 
White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany , however , offered a different explanation for the delay . 
She told reporters last week that Trump was holding off , in part , " to show Americans that our priority are the most vulnerable . " 
Dr Anthony Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious diseases expert , have recommended that Trump be vaccinated without delay . 
He told ABC News : Even though the president himself was infected , and he has , likely , antibodies that likely would be protective , we ’re not sure how long that protection lasts . 
So , to be doubly sure , I would recommend that he get vaccinated .
