More than a third of Americans misused cleaners and disinfectants to try to prevent infection by the coronavirus , according to a survey taken shortly after Donald Trump publicly asked whether injecting such products could treat Covid 19 , reports Reuters . 
Washing food with bleach , using household cleaning or disinfectant products on bare skin , and intentionally inhaling or ingesting the products were some of the most commonly reported " high risk " practices in a 4 May online survey of 502 US adults , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported . 
The survey â€™s lead author said it was undertaken following a " sharp increase " in calls to poison control centres . 
In late April , Trump asked scientists during one of his coronavirus task force briefings whether inserting disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with the virus might help clear the disease , horrifying health experts . 
Makers of household cleaners were compelled to urge people not to drink or inject their products . 
Some 39 % of people surveyed reported intentionally engaging in at least one high risk practice , including using bleach to clean food or misting the body with a disinfectant spray . 
Four per cent drank or gargled with diluted bleach solutions , soapy water or disinfectants .
