Covid 19 patients who received cancer treatments that suppress their immune system may remain contagious and able to spread the coronavirus for two months or more , according to a study published on Tuesday . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) currently recommends that when patients have compromised immune systems , healthcare workers follow extra precautions such as wearing respirators instead of face masks and isolate patients for up to 20 days after symptoms appear . 
In the new study , researchers analysed sputum and swab samples from 20 immunosuppressed cancer patients infected with the coronavirus . 
They found three were contagious for more than three weeks after their symptoms began , including one who remained contagious for 61 days . 
The three patients had received either a stem cell transplant or therapy with genetically engineered immune cells called CAR T cells within the previous six months . 
Two of the three had developed severe Covid 19 . 
None of them had antibodies to the virus . 
Current public health recommendations for Covid 19 patients with weak immune systems are based on limited data and may need to be revised , the researchers said in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine . 
" We know from several studies that if you ’re ... healthy , you are no longer infectious after the first week of illness . 
But there is very little we know about immunocompromised patients , " said Mini Kamboj , one of the study ’s authors from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . 
" Is that 20 days enough or do we need to exercise precautions for longer than that ? " 
While only a small proportion of cancer patients with Covid 19 are likely to remain contagious for prolonged periods , " it ’s a residual risk that we need to address , " Kamboj said . 
" We need to keep an open mind about how ( much ) longer immunocompromised patients could pose an infection risk to others . "
