Sydney residents will learn on Wednesday whether Covid 19 restrictions will be eased ahead of the Christmas holidays and if the northern seaside suburbs can come out of a lockdown after a fresh virus cluster was detected there last week . 
About a quarter of a million residents in Australia ’s largest city have been asked to stay home for five days from Saturday as authorities rushed to contain the cluster , which had grown to 90 cases as of Tuesday . 
Residents in the affected areas were asked to go outside only for one of four essential reasons - grocery shopping , work , emergency medical treatment or visiting an isolated relative . 
Current restrictions are due to expire at midnight on Wednesday . 
New South Wales ( NSW ) , of which Sydney is the capital , reported on Tuesday its lowest rise in new local coronavirus cases in almost a week after record testing numbers , stoking optimism the cluster has been contained . 
NSW authorities have added dozens of venues across the city linked to the cluster and urged Sydney ’s 5 million residents to remain vigilant . 
Australia has reported just over 28,200 coronavirus cases and 908 deaths since the pandemic began .
