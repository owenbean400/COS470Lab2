Australia ’s treasurer Josh Frydenberg has conceded that some businesses will inevitably fail due to the Covid 19 recession and the end of wage subsidies in March 2021 . 
Australia is shifting from a $ 70bn subsidy to keep people employed in their current roles ( jobkeeper ) to a $ 4bn hiring credit for businesses to hire workers aged under 35 ( the jobmaker hiring credit ) . 
Frydenberg told ABC ’s Insiders : Some business will not survive and obviously some jobs will be lost ... 
But what we are focused on is giving every business and every job the best possible chance of getting to the other side , and there will be a restructure across the economy . 
Interestingly , when treasury did their review of the jobkeeper program , they did say it had some adverse incentives which became more pronounced as the recovery picked up , namely it prevented the reallocation of workers to more productive roles across the economy . 
So we want to ensure there is enough dynamism in the labour market .
