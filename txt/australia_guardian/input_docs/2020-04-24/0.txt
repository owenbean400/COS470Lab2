Hi , this Helen Davidson here to take you through the next few hours of updates . 
Thanks to Kevin Rawlinson and my other colleagues in London for their work . 
In Australia and New Zealand it is Anzac Day , the annual day of remembrance for armed forces . 
With both countries under lockdowns or strict social distancing rules , there was not the usual parades or public dawn services . 
Instead , people were encouraged to stand at the ends of their driveways for moments of silence . 
New Zealand ’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern was one of many thousands of Kiwis who spent at least a minute of their mornings in contemplation by their letterbox . 
She issued a message , addressing both the unique nature of the 2020 commemoration and the ways that war have shaped her modern nation . 
" While we cannot gather in person , we join in spirit as we remember the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders in times of war and crisis , " she said . 
" Many New Zealanders have been affected by war or know somebody who has . 
" Returned and current service personnel , friends and families of the fallen , New Zealanders who have come to start a new life here as refugees - through Anzac Day we are all connected . " 
At the Australian War Memorial in Canberra , prime minister Scott Morrison attended a service which was closed to the public but filmed by media . 
He reflected on a 1919 gathering in Gallipoli . 
" A small group of Anzacs who ’d been arranging and tending the graves of their mates gathered and there was no pomp at that little service , there were no dignitaries , no band , just the sound of lapping water on the lonely shore , " he said . 
" One said of that little service , ‘ It was the real thing ’ . 
" And so our remembrances today , small , quiet and homely will be . "
