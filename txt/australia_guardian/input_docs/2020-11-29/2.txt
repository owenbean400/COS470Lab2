New South Wales recorded no new cases of locally acquired Covid 19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night , meaning the state has now gone 22 days without any local transmission . 
Four cases were reported in overseas travellers . 
This brings the total number of cases in NSW to 4,379 since the start of the pandemic . 
Health officials said there still may be transmission among people who have unrecognised infections with mild or no symptoms , and that anyone with symptoms was encouraged to come forwards for testing . 
There were 10,256 tests reported to 8pm last night , compared with 12,106 in the previous 24 hours . 
As large parts of the state swelter in 40C temperatures , NSW Health urged people who can cool their homes to stay there so as not to overcrowd public indoor spaces where people seek respite from the heat . 
Those heading to the beach or pool were also urged to keep 1.5 metres from people , and to swim and leave .
