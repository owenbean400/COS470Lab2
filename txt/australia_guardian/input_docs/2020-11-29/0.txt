Australians are wasting more food during the coronavirus pandemic , mainly because of panic buying and food delivery services . 
The annual bill for the country ’s wasteful food choices has surged to $ 10.3 billion since the pandemic reached Australia , according to Rabobank ’s 2020 Food Waste Report – up from $ 8.64 billion . 
That is an all time annual high of $ 1,043 per household , and an increase of around $ 170 each . 
" It ’s to be expected that food waste has been de prioritised by Australians during this stressful year when our attention has been focused on other urgent issues , " Rabobank ’s Glenn Wealands said in a statement on Monday . 
" ( But ) the average household is now wasting nearly 13 % of the groceries they buy and also spending more on food delivery and self prepare food services . "
