Tasmania is going into quarantine to prevent mainland Australians from spreading the virus . 
It is the first time border controls have been introduced between Australian states , and a particularly extreme measure in a state whose economy relies heavily on tourism . 
The Tasmanian premier , Peter Gutwein , told reporters in Hobart on Thursday that from midnight on Friday ( AEDT ) , all arrivals to Tasmania — including Tasmanians returning home — will have to go into a 14 day mandatory self isolation . 
The only exception is for essential services , like health workers . 
The penalty for breaching this mandatory self isolation is a fine of up to AUD$16,800 ( £ 8,366 ) or six months jail . 
Gutwein said : I think it is an extra layer of protection on Tasmanians . 
This will be , in Tasmania , the strongest border measures in the country in terms of the states and territories ... 
But I want to make it clear as well : any Tasmanian can still come home . 
If they come home after midnight on Friday , they will need to go into a two week quarantine . 
This is an extension of the rules on quarantine for people returning to Australia from overseas , which have applied nationally since Monday .
