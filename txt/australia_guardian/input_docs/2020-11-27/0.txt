# Stay Safe Stay Open # COVID19Vic The other big news out of Victoria is the continuing fallout from the inquiry into hotel quarantine . 
Late on Friday afternoon , the inquiry released hundreds of pages of emails , call records , meeting notes and affidavits obtained in the two months since the inquiry held its last hearing . 
The Victorian chief medical officer , Brett Sutton , said in an affidavit released on Friday that he was aware that the emails showed an " apparent inconsistency " with his earlier evidence . 
But he maintained he was unaware of the use of private security guards in hotel quarantine until late May . Former police commissioner Graham Ashton told the inquiry it was top Victorian bureaucrat Chris Eccles who led him to believe private security would be used . 
The ex police chief ’s recollection of a phone call at 1.17 pm on March 27 was detailed in a fresh sworn statement tendered to the inquiry on Friday . 
Ashton wrote that he and Eccles spoke for 136 seconds following a meeting of the national cabinet . 
" At least part of this conversation involved Mr Eccles informing me regarding the potential use of the ADF to guard returned travellers during the transfer from their flights and the use of private security to guard them at the hotels , " he wrote . 
" But my belief as to what he told me in this regard is based only on the inference which I draw from the contents of the text message which I sent to AFP Commr Reece Kershaw . " 
This text to Ashton ’s AFP counterpart was sent just minutes after the call with Eccles , saying he had been advised private security would be used . 
Eccles maintained he could not recall the content of the conversation with Ashton and was adamant he had " no knowledge " of any decision to use police , the ADF , the AFP or private security .
