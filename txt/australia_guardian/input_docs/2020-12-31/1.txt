A Brazilian lab said it has detected two cases of the new coronavirus variant that has spread rapidly in Britain , and urged reinforcement of quarantine measures for travellers coming from Europe . 
Diagnostic medicine company Dasa said it had detected the SARS Co V 2 strain B.1.1.7 through genetic sequencing done in partnership with Sao Paulo university â€™s tropical medicine institute . 
" Sequencing confirmed that the new strain of the virus has arrived in Brazil , " said researcher Ester Sabino at the tropical medicine institute . 
The new variant has rapidly become the dominant strain in cases of Covid 19 in parts of southern England , and has been linked to an increase in hospitalisation rates . 
Australia , Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain . 
Scientists say that , while it is not more lethal than the original strain , it is significantly more transmissible . 
" Given its high transmission power , this result reinforces the importance of quarantine , and of maintaining isolation for 10 days , especially for those who are coming or just arrived from Europe , " Sabino said .
