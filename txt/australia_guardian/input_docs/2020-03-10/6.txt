The Australian government is expected to announce a stimulus package on Thursday to bolster an economy that has taken a battering over the coronavirus . 
It ’s expected to include details of financial support for casual and low paid workers who may not have good sick leave provisions , to support people who are asked to go into self isolation . 
The prime minister , Scott Morrison , was asked about comments from the NSW business council suggesting employers should not pay sick leave unless their employees are actually sick — so not if they are asked to go into precautionary isolation . 
Morrison said he would encourage workers to be " flexible " . 
Where people are in a position where they have to isolate , either have an obligation to or otherwise , I ’d be encouraging employees to take a flexibility and forward leaning approach in supporting their employees during this process ... . 
Businesses , particularly large businesses , you know , they will be watched closely , I think , through the months ahead . 
You know , businesses spend a lot of time talking about the value and integrity of their brands . 
Well , their brands will be defined in these months ahead . 
He said the stimulus package to be announced tomorrow would be " well balanced , " and that the crisis would have " a finite impact on the economy . " 
So there is a need for the response to be " proportionate " . 
Interpret that as you will .
