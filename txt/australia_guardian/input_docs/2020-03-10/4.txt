Australia ’s chief medical officer , professor Brendan Murphy , is urging people who have not recently been overseas not to seek testing for coronavirus , saying they are putting " a burden on the system . " 
Murphy says : We have seen over recent days a number of people seeking testing who do not need it . 
It ’s clear that there is some anxiety in the community with over 100 cases , but I say — as I have said on many occasions — a couple of things : Most of these cases are related to imports from overseas . 
There is only one element of significant community transmission and that ’s small and controlled in Sydney . 
There is no point being tested at the moment if you have not travelled or if you ’ve not been in contact - even if you have flu like illnesses . 
We are not saying to people who get acute respiratory symptoms , a cold or a flu , to go and get tested for COVID 19 . 
We are saying that if you ’ve come back from overseas , if you ’re a returned traveller or you ’ve been in contact with someone who has been a confirmed case , then you should be tested . 
But other Australians do not need testing and all they ’re doing is putting an unnecessary burden on the testing .
