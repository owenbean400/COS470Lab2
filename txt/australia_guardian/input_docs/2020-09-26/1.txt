Here is some of the reaction to the resignation of Victoria ’s health minister Jenny Mikakos less than an hour ago , including from the former state liberal party leader Matthew Guy and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett . 
We still have not been given a time for the daily press conference from the premier , Daniel Andrews . 
2 Days ago Premier Andrews was supporting Health Minister Mikakos , yesterday he decided to throw her and senior Victorian public servants under the bus . 
The buck always stops at the top . 
He has demonstratively failed . 
He should resign immediately . 
And watch the leaking start now . 
In her statement Mikakos said while she is " deeply sorry for the situation Victorians find themselves in " it also says " in good conscience , I do not believe that my actions led to them " . 
It follows comments from Andrews to the hotel quarantine inquiry on Friday that he regarded Mikakos as " accountable for the program " that ultimately led to Victoria ’s virus second wave . 
Because Andrews is clearly lying . 
He is the one that should be resigning .
