Australia ’s attorney general Christian Porter said the laws used to detain people at airports and other entry points could also be used to stop people elsewhere , as the government attempts to keep a lid on the coronavirus spread in Australia . 
" It ’s very likely that these laws will get used on a larger scale , " Porter told ABC radio RN on Tuesday morning . 
" And it ’s very likely that Australians will encounter practices and instructions and circumstances that they have not had to encounter before , " he said .
