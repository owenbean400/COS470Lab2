Australia ’s top medical officers will meet on Tuesday to consider whether mass gatherings such as sporting events should be cancelled as the country grapples with the first two cases of community transmission of coronavirus . 
The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee – made up of Australia ’s chief medical officers – will meet to consider whether it was necessary to introduce bans on mass gatherings including large sport and entertainment events . 
It comes after officials in New South Wales on Monday confirmed a 53 year old health worker and 41 year old woman as the first two cases of patient to patient transfer in the country . 
The woman was believed to have contracted the virus from her brother , who had recently returned from Iran . 
However officials expressed concern about the origin of the health worker ’s illness ; he had not recently travelled to an affected country and had not knowingly been in contact with an infected person . 
Previously , the only people with the virus in Australia were those who had contracted it in other countries .
