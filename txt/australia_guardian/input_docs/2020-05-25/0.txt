Reuters reports that New South Wales , Australia ’s most populous state , has urged locals to continue working from home despite schools reopening as the number of coronavirus cases slows . 
The country has reported just over 7,100 infections and 102 deaths , well below figures reported by other developed countries , and with fewer than 20 new cases most days , states are pressing ahead with a three stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July . 
In New South Wales , which includes the city of Sydney , children returned to full time face to face learning on Monday , allowing many parents to return to offices – although lawmakers urged those who could to stay home to avoid putting pressure on the transport network . 
" I am very pleased that the system has not been overwhelmed , " the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney . 
" People are listening , making informed decisions , and that is the way we would like it to continue . "
