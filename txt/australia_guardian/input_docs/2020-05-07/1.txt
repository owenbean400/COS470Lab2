Australia ’s national Cabinet was on Friday expected to ease some social distancing restrictions as the number of new coronavirus infections slows . 
With fewer than 20 new infections each day , Australia ’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week said he would meet with state and territory leaders to decide which restrictions will be eased . 
Australia ’s Minister for Health Greg Hunt said he expected the Cabinet to detail a timetable for easing those restrictions . 
" What I expect is a clear roadmap out , with clear stages , " Hunt told reporters in Melbourne .
