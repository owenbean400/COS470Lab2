The Australian state of Victoria is mulling further coronavirus restrictions after recording more than 1,300 new cases over the past two days . 
As the crisis in Victoria worsened , it emerged that a growing number of doctors were in intensive care after contracting Covid 19 , including an emergency doctor in his 30s and a GP in his 60s . 
Meanwhile , St Basil â€™s , a Melbourne aged care home where several residents have died , has been evacuated because six replacement workers sent in under an emergency government takeover have also tested positive . 
In New South Wales , 21 new cases were recorded on Friday . 
On Friday night , a grocery store at Leichhardt in Sydney , Harris Farm Markets , announced a customer had tested positive , but it will remain open following deep cleaning .
