In Australia , Victorian protesters are being urged to stay at home as police vow to shut down anti lockdown rallies planned for Saturday . 
Early on Saturday , police raided the home of James Bartolo , who runs conspiracy website The Conscious Truth Network , and charged him with incitement . 
Bartolo , who posted footage of his arrest online , is the fifth Victorian arrested over plans for the illegal " Freedom Day " rally . 
" Woke up this morning , jumped on the dunny , heard some knocks on the door , " Bartolo wrote on social media . 
" It was all the cops , they broke down the door , arrested me , they took computers , laptops ( and my ) phone . 
" It is a bit of a pain in the ass . 
They stole my shit . 
Whatever . 
I ’m fine . " 
Bartolo told supporters to not attend today ’s rally because he believed it was " a trap " " It is the worst possible thing to do . 
It is a set up from the get go . 
It is all just terrible . 
Do not go to that one . 
What is going to happen , Dan Andrews will blame the protest for the lockdown extension . 
Do not go to the protest . "
