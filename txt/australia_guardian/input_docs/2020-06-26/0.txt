Australia is bracing for the likelihood of more coronavirus cases as hundreds of return travellers land in the coming days , and a worrying surge in infections continues in the state of Victoria . 
Although the virus has been all but eliminated in large swathes of the country , the Victorian capital Melbourne continued its run of double digit case increases with 30 new cases on Friday , while the city also recorded the first Covid related death in many weeks on Wednesday . 
Despite authorities ’ concerns in Victoria , others states where community transmission is negligible are beginning to open up their economies . 
Western Australia ’s nightclubs , for example , are among a large list of businesses allowed to reopen this weekend . 
Still , Australia ’s outgoing chief medical officer , Brendan Murphy , said Friday night he was sure that the country ’s borders would not fully reopen until a vaccine is found . 
It followed a prediction from the national carrier , Qantas , that international travel would not resume for Australians until July next year .
