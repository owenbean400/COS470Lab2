Staying in the US , Reuters reports that the White House is yet to commit to temperature checks for airline passengers . 
The vice president , Mike Pence , met with the chief executives of United Airlines , Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , Jet Blue Airways and the president of Southwest Airlines at the White House alongside Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao , Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) director Mark Redfield , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other officials . 
Airlines want the US government to administer temperature checks to all passengers in a bid to reassure the public . 
The Trump administration is open to the idea of having the Transportation Security Administration conduct the tests , but there are still many unanswered questions , including what would happen to passengers who had high fevers and were denied boarding and how to pay for the screening . 
Reuters said the CDC does not want to be responsible for travellers with high fevers , according to two people briefed on the meeting .
