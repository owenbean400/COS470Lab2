There are growing concerns about a surge in cases in Melbourne , where increasing community transmission has put the city at odds with the rest of Australia , where the virus is mostly contained . 
Australia has not sought to eliminate the virus – as its neighbours New Zealand have attempted – but its suppression strategy relies heavily on the ability to effectively test and trace . 
While testing in Melbourne is at globally impressive levels , The Age newspaper reports that cases with an unknown source are at their highest levels since the pandemic reached Victoria . 
The newspaper said more than one third of new cases confirmed between 17 June and 23 June were thought to have been picked up somewhere in the community not linked to identified outbreaks .
