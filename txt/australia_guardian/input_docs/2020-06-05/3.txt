Again on the China travel warning regarding Australia , Australian opposition spokesman for housing Jason Clare , told the ABC there had been a " spike in racist abuse " but said Australia is one of the safest countries in the world . 
" The borders are shut . 
They ’ll probably be shut for some time until we ’ve got a treatment or a vaccine . 
But I ’m sure I speak on behalf of all of the tourist operators up and down and right across Australia when I say that we want to get tourists back when it ’s safe to do so . 
So I hope that the government is working with the Chinese government to ensure that when we can open the border again , we can get Chinese tourists back.9:36 AM Government MP Jason Falinski said the relationship with China was " strained " and there had been unfortunate incidents in Australia , and it was something Australia and China needed to resolve .
