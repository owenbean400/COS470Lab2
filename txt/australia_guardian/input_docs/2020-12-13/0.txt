Australia ’s three oil refineries are being thrown an economic lifeline as the pandemic pushes them to the brink of collapse due to travel and business restrictions triggering a plunge in demand . 
The country ’s energy minister , Angus Taylor , has offered the refineries $ 83.5m of taxpayer . 
The payment is contingent on refineries keeping their doors open and agreeing to an " open book " policy with the government to continually assess their financial standings . 
" The Covid 19 pandemic continues to place immense pressure on our refineries and the many Australians employed in the fuel sector , " Taylor said on Monday . 
" We have worked closely with the sector to design and implement our comprehensive fuel security package . "
