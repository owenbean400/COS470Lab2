Dan Tehan , Australia ’s minister for education , has also spoken about the government wanting to shake up the university sector including doubling the cost of an arts degree . 
He told : ABC News Breakfast : What we want to do is first make sure that we ’ve got additional places in the system because we know as a result of the coronavirus pandemic we ’re going to see more demand for places in the higher education system and also we want to incentivise students to undertake courses that will give them the skills to take the jobs of the future . 
" We need young Australians to help us grow our economy through the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic and what this is all about is incentivising people to look at teaching , to look at nursing , to look at allied health , to look at engineering and to look at IT because we know that the jobs of the future will be in those areas .
