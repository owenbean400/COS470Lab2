Morning/afternoon/evening , wherever these words find you . 
This is Ben Doherty here in Sydney , Australia , taking over our continuing live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic . 
My many thanks to my colleagues for their stewardship thus far . 
As ever , comments , contributions and correspondence all welcomed at ben.doherty@theguardian.com or by twitter @ Ben Doherty Corro . 
The city where I sit is braced for further lockdowns or restrictions , with a new cluster of infections , still small in number , discovered after a long period of no community transmission . 
We will have more details on that in about an hour , and I shall bring you those .
