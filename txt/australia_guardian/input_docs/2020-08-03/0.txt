With not enough workers to pick the upcoming harvest , Australia faces potential food shortages , and its farmers face economic devastation , writes Michael Rose , a research fellow and anthropologist at the Australian National University . 
We are sailing into a food shortage and few are talking about it . 
This needs to change . 
In essence the issue is this : a large proportion of Australia â€™s harvest labour is done by people from abroad who are unable to travel . 
As the months tick down towards the summer harvest there are simply not enough people to pick the fruit . 
If this does not change the result is likely to be shortages and price rises for horticultural products and , even more seriously , devastating hardship for our primary producers .
