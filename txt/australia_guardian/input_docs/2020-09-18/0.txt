Back in Australia , three people who tested positive for Covid 19 in a cluster in the Melbourne suburb of Casey have been hospitalised . 
There are 34 cases in the cluster , with authorities saying the households breached Melbourne â€™s lockdown restrictions . 
As contact tracers work to contain the outbreak , anti lockdown protesters are preparing to defy restrictions .
