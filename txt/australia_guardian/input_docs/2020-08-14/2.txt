The Australian prime minister , Scott Morrison , has just been talking to Sydney radio station 2gb about the findings of that Ruby Princess special commission of inquiry , which cleared federal agencies of wrong doing in the saga . 
" It is as we said it was , " Morrison said . 
" We were being straight with people about what happened and I think the inquiry has borne that out . " 
On the New South Wales Health department , which was criticised in the final report for making " serious errors " in handling the debacle , Morrison said it had been " a very difficult time " . 
" Officials will make mistakes in a pandemic that none of us have had to manage before . 
I think there have been some humble learnings in NSW and I â€™ve seen NSW go from strength to strength . "
