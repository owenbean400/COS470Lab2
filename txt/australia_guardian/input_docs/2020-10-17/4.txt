Cyprus registered a daily record of 203 new coronavirus infections on Saturday , health authorities said , urging the public to stick to strict health protocols at a crucial point in tackling the pandemic . 
The east Mediterranean island had largely kept a lid on cases by introducing an early lockdown in March , which was eased from early May onwards , Reuters reports . 
After a relatively uneventful summer , cases started surging in the early part of this month . 
" We are at possibly the most crucial point in the pandemic , and a possible increase in cases will , unavoidably , lead to the worst case scenario ; that unfortunately we will start counting victims , which is of course something nobody wants , " the health ministry said in a statement . 
Authorities ordered that restaurants , bars and cafeterias in the populous Limassol district in the south close by 10.30pm from Sunday until at least 26 October . 
Cyprus has registered 2,581 coronavirus cases since March and 25 deaths .
