Scott Morrison , the Australian PM , has struck a stern tone in saying that the turnout of huge crowds at Bondi beach on Friday in contravention of social distancing rules was " not ok " . 
He said people had to be more responsible and said the government was considering localised suburban lockdowns . 
What that means is , what may be necessary in a part of Sydney may not be necessary at all in rural NSW or in Perth or other parts of the country but please be assured that what we are working on is to ensure there is a consistent , as far as possible , set of measures and tools that state premiers and chief ministers can use to apply in each of the cases so if you see it happening in one part of the country , that does not necessarily mean it has to apply in your part of the country . 
There are parts of the country , particularly in Sydney , where these outbreaks have been more severe and I know the Premier of NSW has been focusing on these very , very keenly , particularly over the course of recent days as we have seen the increase of the number of cases in NSW .
