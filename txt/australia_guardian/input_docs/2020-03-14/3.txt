In Australia there are now 197 confirmed cases of coronavirus , including three deaths . 
From Monday , gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned . 
The chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy has just said this has put Australia in a good position . 
We are starting these measures perhaps a little bit before some have said they are needed . 
We in Australia want to flatten that curve and keep this under really tight control . 
We do not want to see rapid increases like we have seen in some parts of the world . 
That is why we are moving early . 
We have modelling that says an infection could take some months to go right through the community with a flattened curve . 
But it depends on how it develops . 
It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it , if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks . 
At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it , and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day .
