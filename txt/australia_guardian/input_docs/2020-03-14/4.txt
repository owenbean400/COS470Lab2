On Saturday Australia ’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said school closures are not yet warranted , though mass gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned in Australia from Monday . 
He said not everyone should rush out and get tested if they had symptoms . 
Murphy said that in Australia , " Community transmission is so low at the moment that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are sympathetic . 
We do not want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to get tested . 
We need to preserve the testing for those who needed it . " 
Elsewhere in the world , the US president Donald Trump , after initially declaring coronavirus a " hoax , " has declared a national emergency , which he described as " two very big words " . 
He ’s freed up $ 50 billion in federal resources to the states to combat the virus , but refused to take responsibility for lack of testing availability and delays in rolling tests out . 
And in the UK , mass gatherings are set to be banned .
