In the Australian state of New South Wales , health authorities have in recent weeks been highly critical of pubs and venues refusing to implement proper contact tracing and social distancing measures . 
AAP reports that another NSW pub has now been closed for failing to adhere to Covid 19 health orders . 
The Shaws Bay Hotel in Ballina will be shut for a week from 5am on Saturday after police identified 12 breaches of the public health orders across two visits in late September and early October , which resulted in two $ 5000 fines . 
Police said the breaches included one drunk patron mingling between six different groups and tables in the venue . 
It is the third venue this week to be shut down , AAP reports .
