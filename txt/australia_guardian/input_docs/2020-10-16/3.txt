We ’ve just heard some excellent news from Victoria , the Australian state currently under strict lockdown . 
The state has only recorded a single new Covid 19 case in the past 24 hours , with no new deaths . 
The news will be music to the ears of Victorian residents and could help encourage the Victorian premier , Daniel Andrews , to ease restrictions on Sunday . 
The result takes the state ’s rolling 14 day average of Covid 19 cases to 8.1 . Victoria has been by far the hardest hit of any Australian state or territory during the pandemic , and has faced harsh restrictions , including restrictions on travelling more than 5kms from home and , at one point , a nightly curfew . 
But case numbers have eased considerably in recent weeks , giving residents hope . 
Yesterday there was 1 new case & amp ; the loss of 0 lives reported . 
The rolling 14 day average is down in metro Melb & amp ; regional Vic . 
Cases with unknown source is stable .
