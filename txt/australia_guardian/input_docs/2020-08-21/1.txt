The latest developments in Australia . 
The premier of the Australian state of Queensland , Annastacia Palaszczuk , has confirmed six more cases of Covid 19 at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre , and another three from crew members on ships . 
There are now seven active cases linked to the youth detention centre . 
As a result , people in Brisbane , Ipswich , Logan , Lockyer Valley and Moreton Bay and Redlands will only be allowed to have gatherings of 10 people indoors and outdoors . 
For the rest of the state it is limited to 30 people . 
Palaszczuk said she expects more cases could be linked to the cluster but they are waiting for the test results to come back . 
She says staff and children at the centre are " well looked after " . 
The state is still currently not accepting visitors from NSW , the ACT and Victoria . 
In the southern state of Victoria , there is hope the state has passed the peak of its second wave , with daily case numbers dropping below 200 for the first time since 13 July . 
Also a cause of hope was the fact that just 24 of those cases were so called " mystery cases " where the source of the infection is unknown . 
Authorities are not getting complacent , however , and this weekend marks just the halfway mark of stage four lockdown and curfew for Melbourne , and stage three for the rest of the state .
