Australia â€™s second most populous state of Victoria on Friday said 12 people died from the coronavirus in the last 24 hours and it reported 113 new cases . 
Victoria , which has become the virus hot spot of the country , a day earlier reported 23 deaths and 113 cases , its lowest daily rise in nearly two months . 
Strict lockdown measures have helped ease the daily rise of Covid 19 infections in Victoria after the state hit a one day high of more than 700 cases about three weeks ago .
