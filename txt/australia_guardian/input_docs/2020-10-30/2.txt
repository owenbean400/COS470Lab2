Residents in the Australian city of Melbourne are easing in to their first weekend since the end of one of the world â€™s longest lockdowns . 
Eased restrictions for the city of five million mean locals can now dine at cafes and restaurants , or grab a drink at bars and pubs . 
However , strict patron limits remain in place and venues have been encouraged to seat customers outside . 
Retailers are also open once again , and residents may now invite two adults from the same household into their homes . 
The restrictions were eased on Wednesday , with some venues opening their doors to customers from just past the stroke of midnight .
