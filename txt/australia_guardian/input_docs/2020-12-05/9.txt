Britain ’s Queen Elizabeth is expected to receive the Covid 19 vaccine within weeks , as public health experts believe this would encourage more people to take up the jab . 
Both the 94 year old Monarch and her husband Prince Philip , 99 , will not get preferential treatment , but will instead " wait in line " during the first wave of injections reserved for the over 80s and care home residents , the Mail on Sunday reports . 
Both are expected to accept the offer of the injection on the advice of their doctors . 
The move is hoped to help the government ’s attempts to combat misinformation about the vaccine spread by conspiracy theorists which could lead to a substantial proportion of the population refusing the jab .
