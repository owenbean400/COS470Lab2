Kuwaitis hoping for reform went to the polls on Saturday in a parliamentary election overshadowed by Covid 19 , with facilities laid on so citizens infected with the disease could vote in special polling stations . 
The oil rich emirate has enforced some of the strictest regulations in the Gulf to combat the spread of the virus , imposing a months long lockdown earlier this year . 
While some of those curbs have been eased , masks remain mandatory outdoors and temperature checks routine , AFP reports . 
On Saturday , authorities set up security barriers around the country â€™s 102 polling stations to prevent gatherings , with designated lanes for entry and exit . 
Mask clad voters , who were also forced to wear gloves , were subject to temperature checks before entering the facilities where election officials stood behind glass barriers . 
The polls were the first since the new emir , Sheikh Nawaf al Ahmad Al Sabah , took office in September following the death of his half brother , Sheikh Sabah al Ahmad Al Sabah , at the age of 91 . 
Unlike other oil rich Gulf states , Kuwait has a lively political life and its parliament , elected for four year terms , enjoys wide legislative powers . 
But with more than 144,000 novel coronavirus cases to date , including 889 deaths , the election campaign has been toned down . 
Yet the normal themes have remained : promises to fight corruption and address youth employment , along with debates over freedom of expression , housing , education and the thorny issue of the stateless " bidoon " minority . 
Some Kuwaitis have expressed their desire for change and reform in their country , where 70 percent of the 4.8 million population are foreigners .
