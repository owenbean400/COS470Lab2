The coronavirus pandemic has made life difficult for a lot of people in the Czech Republic – and that includes St Nicholas , writes the Associated Press . 
Every year on 5 December , Nicholas appears in costume on streets across the European country , joined by a winged angel and a masked devil rattling a metal chain . 
The trio goes door to door visiting children and giving them candy and small gifts , if they have been well behaved . 
If not , the devil threatens to put the girls and boys in his sack and take them directly to hell - unless the angel intervenes . 
The Czech health minister insisted the traditional trio needed to follow the government ’s infection control measures just like everyone else , which meant wearing masks and practicing social distancing . 
A new circus company in Prague offered another option on Saturday . 
The troupe set up an imaginary heaven and hell and invited families to come in cars to watch devils jumping , angels flying and Saint Nicholas waving . 
A long line of cars at the La Putyka Circus base in Prague formed an eager audience for the drive thru performance . 
The kids still hoped to find a stocking filled with chocolates , oranges and nuts on a window , but with the angel , devil and Nicholas in town , they know it wo not be long until Christmas .
