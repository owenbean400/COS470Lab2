Australian Liberal MP Tim Wilson has defended the prime minister ’s decision to request the next fortnight of parliament to be cancelled . 
I ca not think of a single federal MP who does not want parliament to sit , including the prime minister , including the ministry , including backbenchers , including the opposition , including senators . 
But unfortunately the circumstances that we ’re presented with put us in a situation where it ’s the responsible thing to do at this time ... 
The advice is informed by an evolving situation . 
Actions that might have been acceptable a week ago are not necessarily acceptable today . 
What the prime minister ’s done is taken medical advice based on the circumstances in which we face . 
Parliament brings together people from all over the country and puts them in one place . 
If there is deemed a sufficient risk that Victorians and the evolving situation in New South Wales might lead to spreads elsewhere , the cost and consequences could be extraordinary .
