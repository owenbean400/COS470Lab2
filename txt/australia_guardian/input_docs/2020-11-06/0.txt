In Australia , Victoria has achieved a week without new cases or deaths . 
It follows the state ’s second virus wave , which resulted in more than 18,000 infections and 800 deaths , and resulted in the state being locked down . 
But steps towards normal living are about to gain pace with Covid 19 restrictions further easing and flights to resume from New Zealand . 
The Victorian premier , Daniel Andrews , is expected to announce another relaxation of rules on Sunday , including the removal of the " ring of steel " around Melbourne which currently prevents travel between metropolitan Melbourne and regional areas . 
The city ’s residents will no longer be confined to a 25 kilometre radius from home and allowed to travel to regional Victoria . 
Travel freedom will expand again when the New South Wales border reopens to Victorians on 23 November . 
Andrews said on Friday that his Sunday announcement would include a plan for the rest of the month."They will be big steps , they ’ll get us much closer to normal than we ’ve been for six or seven months , which is very significant , " he said .
