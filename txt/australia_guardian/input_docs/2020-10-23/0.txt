Health experts fear that the planned global eradication of potentially fatal polio has been delayed by Covid 19 , and a resurgence of the condition could be felt in Australia , AAP reports . 
The coronavirus pandemic has diverted polio resources in more than 55 countries , including Asia Pacific nations and Papua New Guinea , where the virus briefly reappeared in 2018 after almost two decades . 
The World Health Organisation backed global polio eradication initiative , estimated to have saved 1.5 million lives and prevented life long paralysis for 16 million others , was suspended in March and did not resume until July . 
The Australian director of poverty tackling group Global Citizen , Sarah Meredith , said the four month vaccination pause was a setback with the world on the brink of wiping out the infectious disease which attacks the central nervous system . 
" We ’re racing against time at the moment to try and reach every last child , " she said . 
Global polio cases have fallen by 99.9 % since 1988 , from about 350,000 to 176 last year . 
The last vestiges of wild polio virus are circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan where 129 cases have been detected to date this year – up from 88 at the same time in 2019 . 
" We are so close to eradicating this disease , " Meredith said . 
" The biggest challenge has been getting to the heart of parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan to get the vaccine out there . "
