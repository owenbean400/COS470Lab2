In Sydney , Australia ’s most populous city and the centre of the Australian outbreak of Covid 19 , the premier of New South Wales Gladys Berejiklian has just announced there are now 77 cases across that state , out of 128 in Australia . 
Most of the cases are patients who have travelled overseas or who have had close contact with a confirmed case in Australia . 
But NSW ’s chief health officer , Dr Kerry Chant , said there were cases presenting in the state without an obvious epidemiological link , suggesting the Covid 19 was spreading in the community undetected . 
What is more challenging is that we have had cases where we ca not find an epidemiological link . 
Overnight , we have seen cases being diagnosed in people without overseas travel . 
Those cases are being thoroughly interviewed to ensure that we can identify any links to other confirmed cases to build up our picture .
