This week in Australia , the Queensland government announced it would expand the border zone further into New South Wales to include councils taking in Byron Bay and other northern communities . 
There has been pressure on the Queensland premier , Annastacia Palasczuk , for weeks to ease border restrictions , but the state is keen to avoid cases in Victoria and NSW from entering . 
On Saturday the premier tweeted that the " solid health response " had kept Queenslanders safe . 
When you look at COVID 19 stats from around the world , it really brings home how well we ’ve done here in Queensland . 
Our solid health response has kept us safe , but it ’s important that we do not get complacent . 
Keep following the health advice and stay safe ❤ ️ # covid19
