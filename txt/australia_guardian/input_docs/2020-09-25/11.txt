AFP reports that on Friday the American credit rating agency Fitch Ratings left Britain ’s debt rating unchanged at AA - and the outlook at negative , after downgrading both in March on fears of economic damage from Covid 19 . 
The affirmed negative outlook " reflects the impact the coronavirus pandemic is having on the UK economy and the resulting material deterioration in the public finances , with Fitch forecasting the fiscal deficit to materially widen this year and government debt set to increase to well over 120 % of GDP over the next few years , " it said . 
Fitch saw Britain ’s deficit climbing to 17.7 % of GDP this year from 2.2 % in 2019 , an increase well above that seen during the 2008-10 global financial crisis , which the agency blamed on the slowdown in economic activity and government measures to fend off the pandemic . 
The deficit is predicted to drop back to about 12 % of GDP by next year and below 10 % of GDP in 2022 . 
The forecast comes after the British prime minister , Boris Johnson , announced a raft of new restrictions in England earlier this week , mirrored to varying extents in other UK nations , to try to curb a rise in coronavirus cases .
