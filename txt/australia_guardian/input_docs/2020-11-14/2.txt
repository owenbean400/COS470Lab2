Hi everyone , It ’s Christopher Knaus here , I ’ll be live blogging the latest Covid 19 developments for the next little while . 
Just staying with Australia , for the moment . 
A key problem facing the nation is the repatriation of stranded Australians abroad . 
The education minister has just made an announcement about a related issue : how to return international university students to the nation . 
Education minister Dan Tehan has instructed states and territories to draw up plans for the return of international students , while staying within their quarantine caps . 
Tehan spoke to Sky News a little earlier : Our priority is returning Australians and that will continue to be the case especially in the lead up to Christmas But we have asked state and territory governments to submit plans to us as to how they can bring in international students back . 
The loss of international students has crippled Australia ’s university sector , which is estimated to have lost up to 12,000 jobs .
