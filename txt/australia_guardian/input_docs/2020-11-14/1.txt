From Australian Associated Press : New South Wales contact tracers are racing to reach 455 travellers to Australia from New Zealand after a positive case was confirmed in Auckland . 
Those who have arrived in NSW from New Zealand since 5 November have been sent a message with NSW Health advice and are being contacted and alerted about a number of venues of concern in Auckland . 
NSW Health said in a statement no passengers arriving in Sydney from New Zealand on Friday evening reported having visited the locations and none had symptoms . 
" Airlines will ascertain if passengers have attended these venues before they leave New Zealand and if they have , they will be not allowed to travel , " the department said . 
NSW has now gone a week without a locally transmitted virus case but health authorities are still urging the community to keep getting tested . 
NSW will reopen its border with Victoria on 23 November . 
The southern state has recorded more than two weeks of consecutive zero transmission days .
