Australia ’s federal health minister Greg Hunt has just spoken in Canberra . 
He was asked about Australia ’s efforts to return stranded citizens from abroad . 
He says Australia is exploring " green lanes " with other nations , an arrangement already in place with New Zealand . 
Green lanes are agreements that allow travel without quarantine . 
Hunt : We have the green lane with New Zealand and there ’s the potential for other green lanes for countries where the medical advice is that they are considered overwhelmingly safe for bringing people to Australia without quarantine . 
That is something that will be used cautiously and carefully . 
He said Australia was working to begin to return international students also . 
But he said that would not be done in a way that displaces returning citizens . 
The prime minister has been absolutely clear that he would not detract from the ability to bring Australians home .
