Still in Australia : asked whether he would extend that travel advice to the general public , state chief health officer Dr . Sutton says : I think everyone needs to give consideration to information that is important to them . 
People have family around the world , people have different risk tolerance . 
But people should look at the WHO website ... 
It does depend on if you are in a vulnerable and high risk age group , it does depend on who you are travelling with , how long you will be there for , and the extent to which you can protect yourself in terms of from others . 
There are lots of complex things at play . 
For the Department of education they needed a definitive statement , but for everyone else , you need to look at all the information and make a judgement for yourself .
