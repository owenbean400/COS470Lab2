In Australia , Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity is working on a more efficient test for Covid 19 . 
They are working on a far more quick test . 
So at the moment it takes about three hours from the time that the swab sample arrives to get a result , and the travel time getting it there does add to the turnaround . 
They are looking at potentially a pin blood test that could mean that we could get a test result within 20 minutes .
