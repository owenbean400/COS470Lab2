In Australia , the majority of Victorians are waking up this morning to their first weekend back in lockdown , which came into effect on Thursday . 
Bordering states -- especially New South Wales -- are on high alert after the Victorian premier , Daniel Andrews , announced a record new 288 cases on Friday – the single highest daily rise in any state since the pandemic began . 
He warned those numbers would increase in the coming days . 
The lockdown led the government to announce a half a billion dollar stimulus package for affected businesses . 
Andrews also said Melbourne would stop taking international flight arrivals for at least two weeks , while it worked to get the outbreak under control . 
There are now 47 people in hospital in the state , including 12 in intensive care . 
The vast majority of the 288 new cases have been locally acquired . 
By comparison , New South Wales reported just 14 new cases on Friday , with 12 of those in returned travellers now in hotel quarantine . 
Meanwhile to ensure more cases of the virus are not imported while Victoria grapples to regain control , Australia ’s national cabinet , made up of the prime minister and state and territory leaders , decided to cap the number of incoming flights allowed in Australia . 
The change means at least 4,000 fewer Australians will return home each week . 
The prime minister , Scott Morrison , acknowledged the change meant " it will be more difficult " for Australians to return home . 
The New South Wales chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant urged the community to be extra vigilant following the closure of the Victorian / New South Wales border to stop spread of the virus on Wednesday . 
The border will remain shut for at least six weeks , the first time it has been closed in more than 100 years .
