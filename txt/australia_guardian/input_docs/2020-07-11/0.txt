Good morning , good evening , hello , wherever you might be . 
This is Helen Davidson taking the reins of the blog for the next few hours . 
Thanks to my colleagues for their coverage . 
We ’ll be starting a new blog shortly , but in the meantime here is some more news on the vaccine front . 
In Australia a potential vaccine developed by the University of Queensland is now ready to be tested on humans , Brisbane ’s Sunday Mail reports . 
The human testing of the " molecular clamp " vaccine candidate , to start on Monday , follows encouraging results from animal testing trials conducted in the Netherlands . 
Professor Robert Booy , head of Clinical Research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance , said the animal trials would have " ticked all the boxes " allowing the human testing to go ahead . 
" There is no way the research team would be able to progress from animals to humans without a complete guarantee of safety and they would likely have a confidence in its effectiveness , " he said .
