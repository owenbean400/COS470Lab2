Families and loved ones will be reunited when the first travellers from New Zealand since the Covid 19 crisis arrive in Queensland without the need to quarantine . 
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk opened the border to NZ residents from 1am on Saturday , with the first flight expected to land in Brisbane about 10.45am . " I know that is going to mean so much to families that have been missing loved ones for such a long time , " she said . 
The decision to lift travel restrictions for travellers from NZ came after the country clocked up 28 days without a locally acquired virus case . 
While people from NZ can now enter Queensland freely , they will still have to go into managed isolation or quarantine when they return home . 
Palaszczuk said she was optimistic the NZ government would soon remove mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals from Australia . 
Queensland is also set to open to travellers from Adelaide from 1am on Saturday , meaning all Australians will be able to freely enter Queensland for the first time since March . 
There were more than 200,000 Kiwis living in Queensland in the 2016 census , making them the largest group of foreign born residents in the state . 
With the easing of coronavirus health restrictions , Queensland will also allow socially distanced dancing at indoor venues from 1am on Monday .
