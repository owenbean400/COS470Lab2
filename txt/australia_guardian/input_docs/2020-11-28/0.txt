From Australian Associated Press : The Australian state of Victoria has recorded its 30th consecutive day without a new Covid 19 case , having last week reached the benchmark for eliminating the virus . 
The state recorded no new cases , no active cases and no lives lost on Saturday from just under 6,000 tests . 
The last Covid 19 patient in a Victorian hospital was discharged on Monday . 
Health authorities say 28 days with no new infections means the virus has been eliminated from the community , given that period represents two 14 day incubation periods . 
New South Wales lifted restrictions for Victorian travellers on Monday , while Queensland and South Australia will reopen their borders from 1 December .
