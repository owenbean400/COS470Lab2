As we reported earlier , the Australian airline Qantas has reduced its flights by a quarter in the wake of falling demand for flights . 
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce , who earned A$24m last year , will forgo his salary for the rest of the financial year . 
Staff will be asked to take unpaid annual leave to avoid job cuts as the business deals with the crisis . 
He is giving a media conference now and said that it ’s a question of " survival of the fittest " in the airline industry , which has been hit very hard by the outbreak . 
He insisted Qantas was well placed to deal with the crisis which has already accounted fior Flybe in the UK . 
Joyce said : We are in a position where we ’re one of the fittest airlines in the world . 
We ’rein a strong position to be able to come out of this and take opportunities . 
And this will be a survival of the fittest .
