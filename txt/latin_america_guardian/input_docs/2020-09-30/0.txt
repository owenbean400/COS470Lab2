Peru will restart international flights to some regional countries as it aims to lift coronavirus restrictions and reopen its economy . 
Flights to 11 destinations in Colombia , Ecuador , Chile , Bolivia , Paraguay , Uruguay and Panama will resume on 5 October , president Martin Vizcarra said , adding that health protocols including coronavirus tests for passengers arriving to Peru will be mandatory . 
Air traffic in Peru has been grounded since mid March after the government announced the first positive coronavirus case . 
The South American country was hit particularly hard by the pandemic , though infections and deaths have slowed in recent weeks . 
Peru , a nation of 32.6 million people , has recorded a total of 811,700 coronavirus cases , the second highest rate in Latin America , and 32,400 deaths . 
" The virus is still in our environment , " Vizcarra said . 
Peru began its " phase 4 " of reopening recently , which marked an increase in economic activities , including higher capacity in restaurants and shops . 
Bars , clubs and casinos remain closed .
