Ecuador has begun storing the bodies of those who have died from coronavirus in giant refrigerated containers , after hundreds of deaths in the city of Guayaquil , the epicentre of the country ’s outbreaks , have filled up morgues and hospitals . 
The government has installed three containers , the largest about 12 meters ( 40 ft ) long , at public hospitals to preserve bodies until graves were prepared , according to Guayaquil ’s mayor , Cynthia Viteri . 
Ecuador ’s death toll is currently at 318 , one of the highest tolls in Latin America . 
President Lenin Moreno warned this week that the real figure was higher , as authorities were collecting more than 100 bodies a day , many from relatives ’ homes , as a strict quarantine prevented them from being buried .
