Peru , which has the second greatest number of cases in Latin America , will continue to enforce social distancing , particularly in markets , banks and public transportation , Vizcarra said . 
In this last stage of the state of emergency , we have to ratify all the good that we have done , which is enough , and to correct the defects .
