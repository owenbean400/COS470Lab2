Brazil registered 627 new deaths from Covid 19 on Monday , the health ministry said , with a new total of 888,271 confirmed cases of coronavirus , after about 20,000 new infections were reported . 
The country continues easing restrictions in several states despite the severity of the outbreak , which is now the second worst in the world after the United States . 
Monday ’s new fatalities are down from an average of nearly 1,000 over the past week , though reporting of deaths typically slows over the weekend . 
Although Brazil ’s official death toll from the pandemic has risen to 43,959 , the true impact is likely far greater than the data show , health experts say , because of a lack of widespread testing in Latin America ’s largest country . 
Brazil ’s education minister , Abraham Weintraub , was fined for failing to wear a face mask on Sunday while attending a rally for president Jair Bolsonaro , who has himself repeatedly flouted the capital ’s masks in public rule . 
He shook hands and posed for pictures with demonstrators , many of whom also went without masks .
