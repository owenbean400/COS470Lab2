A large majority of Mexicans support the work done by president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to contain the coronavirus outbreak and agree with a decision to extend quarantine measures until the end of May , an opinion poll showed on Sunday . 
A telephone survey of 549 Mexicans between 17 and 21 April showed 73 % gave a positive appraisal of Lopez Obrador ’s efforts , with only 17 % of the opposite view . 
The remainder gave no assessment , Reuters reports . 
82 % of respondents said the government had done well in reducing the spread of coronavirus , which as of Saturday evening had led to nearly 14,000 confirmed cases of infection and over 1,300 deaths in Mexico . 
Deaths have doubled in the past week and Mexico ’s government on Tuesday said it was entering the most serious phase of the pandemic . 
Earlier , it extended quarantining until May 30 , a decision that some 72 % of survey respondents supported . 
Mexico ’s government has ordered schools and non essential businesses to close but it has not imposed a strict curfew , unlike some countries in Latin America . 
Mexicans were less sure about Lopez Obrador ’s economic management of the crisis , but the balance of opinion was still favorable . 
Some 62 % said the government had made good decisions to reactivate the economy , with 32 % disagreeing . 
The government is issuing millions of loans to businesses to help them through the pandemic , and has gradually stepped up relief measures . 
Still , their scope is modest compared with some countries . 
Early in the pandemic , Lopez Obrador came under fire for flouting government advice by continuing to hold large public events . 
However , since suspending those gatherings he has been insistent on the need to pursue social distancing . 
The survey showed the government had to strike a balance in satisfying public opinion .
