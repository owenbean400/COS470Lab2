As the outbreak in Ecuador ’s largest city of Guayaquil begins to stabilise , the government is bracing for worsening spread in the highland capital Quito , where at least six people have died in the streets in the past month . 
Guayaquil was at the centre of one of Latin America ’s worst outbreaks in March and April . 
Cemeteries ran out of space and families stored relatives ’ dead bodies in their homes or on the streets as the virus strained the health system ’s capacity to collect them , Reuters has reported . 
But authorities ’ attentions are now turning to Quito , whose 2.8 million residents are under a strict lockdown to contain the virus ’ spread . 
The local government said that , between 4 April and 13 May , it had picked up the bodies of six people who had died in the streets , in addition to seven bodies from homes and two from nursing homes . 
The government said on Thursday night that 135 of the 164 intensive care beds in the city ’s public hospitals are occupied , and that it plans to install about 80 more . 
" Quito ’s health system is reaching its limit , " the city ’s mayor Jorge Yunda said on Friday during the opening of a temporary 380 bed hospital for epidemic patients .
