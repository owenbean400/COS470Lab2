The Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has accused international media outlets of lying as stories accumulate on the country ’s alleged undercounting of its case numbers and death toll . 
Investigations by the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and El País have all included such suggestions . 
In a rambling response to an unrelated question , López Obrador complained about reporters " going to graveyards " and crematoria to verify Covid 19 deaths . 
The famously stubborn López Obrador , who seldom lets critical comments pass unanswered , also called for the foreign press to practice some " self criticism " . 
There ’s a crisis of the lack of ethics in the handling of information in Mexico , in the world . 
The world ’s most famous newspapers lie , slander . 
The New York Times , the Washington Post , the Financial Times , El País , are very famous , but without ethics . 
The outburst came after Reforma , a Mexican newspaper López Obrador frequently criticises , reported it had received threats from someone claiming to be part of the Sinaloa Cartel to blow up its building if it did not stop critical coverage . 
Mexico has reported 42,595 cases and 4,477 deaths as of Thursday . 
A Sky News investigation estimated Mexico City ’s death rate is five times higher than the official figures . 
Still , parts of the country will reopen on Monday and López Obrador says the curve has been " flattened " . 
The president has said he will ask the health secretariat it is okay for him to resume his tours of the country to check on the progress of mega projects under construction and open branches of a government bank . 
Medical experts have questioned if Mexico is ready to reopen ; the country has guided its Covid 19 response with disease modelling , rather than testing . 
Its testing rates rank among the lowest in Latin America at 0.4 per 1,000 people .
