We â€™ve had an update on the anti lockdown protest in The Hague , where Dutch police have now said some 400 people were arrested after they refused to disperse , AFP reports . 
" We have arrested some 400 people today . 
A large number of them have been since let go , " the police said on Twitter . 
Reuters had previously reported that around 100 people had been arrested , based on media reports and witness accounts , as the police had not announced a figure . 
The Hague Mayor Johan Remkes said the demonstration was banned because authorities had information that " troublemakers " from all over the Netherlands , including groups of known football hooligans , were planning to descend on The Hague . 
" This has nothing to do with protesting or the right to freedom of speech . 
This group was deliberately trying to disturb public order , " Remkes said in a statement .
