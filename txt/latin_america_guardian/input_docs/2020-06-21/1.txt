Apple has responded to UK health secretary Matt Hancock ’s earlier attacks on the company ’s " intransigence " , which earned a rare rebuke from the typically taciturn technology corporation . 
Blaming Apple for the delay to the government ’s contact tracing app , which was supposed to launch at the end of May and has now been delayed until at least September , Hancock said : " Of course I wish we had brought it in sooner , I wish that Apple had made the change for it to work in Apple phones in the same way that the original works on Android phones , but we will get there."In response , an Apple spokesperson told the Guardian : " Apple is committed to working with the UK government to help tackle Covid 19 . 
We ’ve been constant collaborators with NHSX and will continue working with them on ways to further optimise the technology while protecting our customers ’ privacy . 
Many countries have successfully launched Exposure Notification apps and we look forward to helping the UK government do the same."On Friday , the Guardian reported that Apple and Google had been taken by surprise by Hancock ’s live public claim that the two companies would work with the government on a " hybrid " contact tracing app , which would apparently incorporate elements from both systems into one new app .
