Mexican healthcare workers are trying to get the pandemic under control without appropriate protection . 
Health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico ’s coronavirus infections , government data shows , one of the highest rates in the world . 
The risks are made worse by shortages of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . 
As a nurse on the front lines of Mexico ’s coronavirus battle , Gisela Hernandez has stayed away from her children for nearly two months , sleeping in a hotel and even her car to avoid infecting them because she feels inadequately protected at work , Reuters reports . 
At night , she video calls Santiago , 5 and Renata , 9 , who are both asthmatic , to hear about what they ’ve done during the day and remind them how much she misses them . 
While Hernandez says she loves her work , and considers the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases ( INER ) in Mexico City her second home , she is also afraid of contracting coronavirus , which has killed 9,415 people in Mexico . 
" I do not regret becoming a nurse because I like to help my patients , " said Hernandez , 40 , whose hospital is one of the city ’s main treatment centers for COVID 19 , the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus . 
But she said she is " scared of getting sick ... scared of never seeing my kids again . " 
Coronavirus cases are surging in Latin America , which along with the United States is now an epicenter of the global pandemic . 
Frontline workers in Mexico City ’s hospitals , including Hernandez , have taken to the streets to complain about the conditions . 
A national march is planned for Monday .
