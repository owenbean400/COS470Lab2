Avianca Holdings , Latin America ’s No . 
2 airline and one of the oldest in the world , filed for bankruptcy on Sunday , as a bond payment deadline loomed and after pleas for aid from Colombia ’s government to weather the coronavirus crisis have so far been unsuccessful . 
If it fails to come out of bankruptcy , Avianca would be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic , which has resulted in a 90 % decline in global air travel . 
Avianca has not flown a regularly scheduled passenger flight since late March and most of its 20,000 employees have gone without pay through the crisis . 
While Avianca was already weak before the coronavirus outbreak , its bankruptcy filing highlights the challenges for airlines that cannot count on state rescues to avoid bankruptcy restructuring . 
An Avianca representative told Reuters it is still trying to secure government loans .
