A major laboratory in Ecuador ’s capital closed and halted processing coronavirus tests Friday because technicians did not have basic supplies like tubes , pipettes , masks and gloves needed to safely analyse the specimens . 
The Biotechnology Institute at Quitos Central University had been expected to receive and process tens of thousands of tests but its director said only 5,150 could be done before running out of equipment . 
" We ca not process any more tests because of a technical failing , " Lucy Baldeón said . 
Ecuador is one of nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Latin America . 
As major cities like Quito begin to reopen , authorities have insisted on the need to increases testing . 
But those efforts have been complicated by corruption scandals , delays in acquiring tests and now shortages of essential lab materials . 
" We have the tests and we ca not use them , " city councilman Bernardo Abad said . 
" They were purchased but the city did not prepare . " 
The Central University lab is one of two contracted directly by Quito officials to boost the city ’s testing capability . 
The other has not yet begun processing specimens . 
The Ministry of Public Health operates its own labs and conducted 16,379 tests in Quito from March to May . 
That testing is expected to continue , though to date has fallen short of what many believe is needed in the city of 2.7m people . 
Ecuador has done 133,458 molecular and rapid COVID 19 tests in all , according to the health ministry , and nation ’s per capita rate trails far behind countries like Chile and Peru that have greatly expanded testing .
