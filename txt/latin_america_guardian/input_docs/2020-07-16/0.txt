Coronavirus support to poor countries has been so far " grossly inadequate and that ’s dangerously shortsighted , " U.N . aid chief Mark Lowcock said as he asked wealthy countries for billions more dollars in assistance . 
The United Nations increased its humanitarian appeal by more than a third to $ 10.3 billion to help 63 states , mainly in Africa and Latin America , tackle the spread and destabilising effects of the coronavirus . 
This is up from the world body ’s initial $ 2 billion request in March , then $ 6.7 billion in May . 
So far , Lowcock said , the United Nations has only received $ 1.7 billion . 
As finance ministers from the Group of 20 major economies prepare to meet virtually on Saturday , Lowcock told reporters : " The message to the G20 is step up now or pay the price later . " 
The United Nations has warned that if action is not taken , the pandemic and associated global recession will trigger an increase in global poverty for the first time since 1990 and push 265 million people to the brink of starvation . 
" The response so far of wealthy nations , who ’ve rightly thrown out the fiscal and monetary rule books to protect their own people and economies , the response that they ’ve made to the situations in other countries has been grossly inadequate and that ’s dangerously shortsighted , " Lowcock said .
