The governor of Brazil ’s São Paulo state , João Doria , said the state is likely to start to immunise its population with China ’s Sinovac vaccine for Covid 19 in mid December , pending regulatory approval . 
Brazil has the third highest number of cases of coronavirus in the world , leading vaccine makers to seek out the country to test their candidates . 
São Paulo is one of the sites of Phase III clinical trials for the Sinovac vaccine conducted by the state ’s Butantan Institute , a leading biomedical research centre . 
Doria told a news conference 5m doses of the vaccine are expected to arrive in São Paulo , the country ’s most populous state , in October . 
The state has a deal with Sinovac for 60m doses to be delivered by the end of February , which Doria said is enough to vaccinate the state ’s entire population . 
Sinovac ’s Latin America head , Xing Han , said the results of the Phase III trials should be out in two months . 
Brazilian state governments have been aggressive in courting vaccine makers , with Bahia and Parana states striking deals to test and buy or produce the Russian Sputnik 5 vaccine . 
Pfizer and partner Bio NTech received Brazilian regulatory approval last week to expand trials of their vaccine in São Paulo and Bahia states . 
The vaccine developed by Astra Zeneca and University of Oxford has a production and distribution deal with the federal biomedical research institute Fiocruz and it is also being tested in Brazil by the federal university of Sao Paulo .
