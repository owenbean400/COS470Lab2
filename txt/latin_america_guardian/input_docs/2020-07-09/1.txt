Here is more on those two top politicians in Latin America testing positive for coronavirus : Venezuela ’s second most powerful man and Bolivia ’s interim president have both announced they have tested positive for Covid 19 - the latest top Latin American politicians to fall victim to a pandemic that has claimed more than 120,000 lives in the region . 
Diosdado Cabello , Venezuela ’s number two official , announced his diagnosis on social media on Thursday evening and said he was in self isolation."We will prevail ! ! " the highly influential Chavista tweeted . 
Jeanine Añez , Bolivia ’s right wing interim leader , said she had received the same diagnosis."I ’ve tested positive for Covid 19 , " tweeted Añez , who took power after Evo Morales was forced from the country last year . 
" I ’m OK , I will work in isolation . 
Together , we will get through this . " 
The news comes after Brazil ’s president , Jair Bolsonaro , announced on Tuesday that he had tested positive for coronavirus . 
Cabello ’s announcement came amid growing concern over Covid 19 ’s advance in Venezuela and the potential for its already collapsed health service to be overwhelmed by the pandemic .
