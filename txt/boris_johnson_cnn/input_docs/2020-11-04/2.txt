UK lawmakers have approved a plan for England to enter a new national lockdown from midnight tonight . 
A total of 516 MPs voted for the coronavirus restrictions , tabled by the government , and just 38 voted against them . 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had faced some opposition from backbenchers in his own Conservative party over the plans , but the opposition Labour Party backed the restrictions -- having called for a " circuit breaker " lockdown for weeks . 
The restrictions will be in place until December 2 . 
An earlier version of this post misstated the number of MPs who voted in favor of England â€™s new lockdown measures . 
This has been corrected .
