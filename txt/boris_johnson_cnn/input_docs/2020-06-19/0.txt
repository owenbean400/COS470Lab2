" As plans continue for a full return to education from September , the government has announced £ 650 million will be shared across state primary and secondary schools over the 2020/21 academic year , " the press release from the Department of Education read . 
School principals will decide where the money is spent , but it is expected it will go toward " small group tuition , " the government said . 
The other portion of the package will be £ 350 million for a tutoring program that " will increase access to high quality tuition for the most disadvantaged young people over the 2020/21 academic year . "
