The British government is " hopeful " of an agreement with the mayor of Manchester to increase anti coronavirus restrictions in the city . 
Jenrick said a package had been offered to Manchester , which included more resources for the city . 
He also said " other options " would have to be considered if an agreement could not be reached . 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing for the city to enter the highest Tier 3 restrictions under a new system introduced in England last week . 
On Saturday , he said the city 's rise in cases was " grave " and " worsens with each passing day . " 
But Andy Burnham , the Mayor of Greater Manchester , said last week that he and other northwest regions opposed Tier 3 lockdowns , which involve the closure of pubs , restrictions on travel and a ban on socializing with people outside your household . 
Burnham said the government 's " flawed and unfair strategy " was asking local leaders to " gamble our residents ' jobs , homes and business and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work . "
