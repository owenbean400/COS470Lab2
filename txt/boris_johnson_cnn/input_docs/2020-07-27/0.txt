Boris Johnson , the UK Prime Minister , has said in a video posted to his official Twitter account that he was " way overweight " when he was admitted to intensive care earlier this year after becoming infected with Covid 19 . 
" I 've always wanted to lose weight for ages and ages , " he said in the clip posted Monday . 
" I think many people , I struggle with my weight . " 
Johnson says in the video that since recovering from the virus , he starts each day by going for a run with his dog , Dilyn , and talks effusively about the personal benefits of losing weight as well as the societal benefits of protecting the UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) . 
The video has been released alongside the launch of the UK government 's strategy to lower obesity rates in the country . 
According to government figures , 63 % of adults are above what would be considered a healthy weight , with around half of those people being obese . 
Equally alarming is the fact that one in five children aged 10-11 are living with obesity , with children living in deprived areas twice as likely to be obese .
