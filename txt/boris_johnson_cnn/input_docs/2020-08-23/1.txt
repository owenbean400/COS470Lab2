British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday that it is " vitally important " to get children back in the classroom when schools reopen next week . 
Referring to comments made earlier Sunday by Chris Whitty , the UK 's chief medical adviser , Johnson said it is " far more damaging " than the virus itself for pupils to stay out of school for any longer . 
The Prime Minister thanked school staff who have been making preparations for a full return in September and reiterated his previous statements about " the moral duty to reopen schools to all pupils safely . " 
On Sunday , the chief medical officers and deputy chief medical officers of England , Scotland , Northern Ireland and Wales released a statement on risks and benefits of schools and child care centers reopening . 
The statement also said international real world evidence suggests that schools reopening have usually not been followed by a surge of Covid 19 .
