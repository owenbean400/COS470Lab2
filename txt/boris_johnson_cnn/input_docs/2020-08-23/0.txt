Keeping UK schools shut would likely be more harmful for children than the coronavirus , said the country 's chief medical adviser , Professor Chris Whitty , amid a debate over the safety of reopening schools . 
Whitty said the evidence was " overwhelmingly clear " that children dying from the virus was low risk . 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously said there was a " moral duty " to reopen schools in the autumn . 
Whitty acknowledged that students returning to the classroom was " likely to put some pressure " on the reproduction rate — or the R rate — which measures how much the virus is being transmitted in the community . 
An R rate of 1 , for example , means every one person with the virus infects one other person , on average . 
Many countries are trying to keep their R rates below 1 to prevent the virus from snowballing . 
On Friday , the UK government updated its guidance to say the country 's R rate was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 . 
The government 's main scientific advisory body on the pandemic , SAGE , also said Friday it " does not have confidence that R is currently below 1 in England . " 
During the interview , Whitty went on to say they were always going to have to balance keeping transmission rates low while doing " the least social economic damage to achieve that . "
