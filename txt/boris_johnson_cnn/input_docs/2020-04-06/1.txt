Queen Elizabeth II offered reassurance to the British public and called for unity on Sunday in a rare televised speech . 
The address comes as UK authorities warn people to stay at home , and as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to the hospital for tests , after days of coronavirus symptoms . 
Johnson tested positive for the virus on March 27 . 
It 's extremely rare for the Queen to address the nation like this : She typically only speaks to the country during an annual televised Christmas message and when a new parliament is installed . 
She 's only held these types of emergency national addresses a handful of times in history -- one time during World War Two , which she alluded to during her speech on Sunday . 
The Queen , 93 , concluded by again calling for unity saying , " we will succeed . "
