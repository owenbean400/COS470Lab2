UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that he " bitterly " regrets the number of coronavirus related deaths seen in care homes , telling British radio station LBC that there were " far too many " lives lost . 
" What happened was absolutely tragic , there 's no question â€¦ we saw far too many lives lost in care homes and we mourn for everyone , " Johnson said Friday . 
" I bitterly , bitterly regret every loss of life that we 've had , " he added . 
Addressing questions over why so many deaths were registered in care homes across the UK , the Prime Minister said he believes several factors must be considered . 
The UK government 's handling of coronavirus in care homes has been widely criticized . 
According to the UK 's Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , 19,394 care home resident deaths in England and Wales from the start of the pandemic until mid June -- or 29.3 % of all care home resident deaths -- involved Covid 19 . 
From March 2 , of all hospital deaths in England and Wales involving Covid 19 , 15.5 % could be accounted for by care home residents , ONS said . 
" I think a lot of different things came together ... the governance of care homes , getting the messages across , making sure people understood what they had to do to protect against the disease , " Johnson said on Friday . 
" I think we 'll have to look back at the whole issue of what happened in care homes in great , great detail , " he added .
