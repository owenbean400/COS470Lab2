President Trump told reporters last night that he had asked US medical companies to " help " with the treatment of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , who is currently in intensive care after he tested positive for Covid 19 nearly two weeks ago . While the spirit of Trump 's offer was no doubt sincere and greeted with gratitude in Downing Street , it is unlikely to have been welcomed — at least at a political level . 
One of the UK government 's top priorities during this time has been to keep the public calm and reiterate its total confidence in the National Health Service . 
In an off camera briefing today , Johnson ’s official spokesperson said the UK government was in " constant contact " with the US government , but that he was " confident " Johnson was getting the " best care from the NHS " and that any decision regarding his treatment would decided by Johnson 's doctors — who are NHS doctors . 
Those of you with British friends will be familiar with tone in this message — thank you , but please stop . 
The optics of an unpopular US president offering US services that are not available on the NHS is one of the least helpful things that Trump could have done during this time . 
Which is probably why Downing Street was so quick to bat away any suggestion that the PM 's doctors would countenance taking him up on the offer .
