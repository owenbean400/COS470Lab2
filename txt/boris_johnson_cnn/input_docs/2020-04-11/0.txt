The half brother of Boris Johnson has described the Prime Minister ’s pre hospitalization treatment as a " shambles . " 
In a statement to CNN , Max Johnson said while he grateful for the care his brother received from the NHS ( National Health Service ) , he is critical of the events leading up to his hospitalization . 
Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care after receiving treatment for coronavirus , Downing Street confirmed Thursday . 
The Prime Minister , 55 , was taken to hospital on Sunday because he was displaying " persistent " coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive . 
His condition deteriorated and he was taken into intensive care on Monday , causing a ripple of shock across the UK . 
In response to Max Johnson ’s comments , Downing Street described the Prime Minister ’s health as a " private matter " adding it would be " inaccurate " to suggest Boris Johnson had not been physically examined by a doctor before entering hospital . 
Max Johnson said he ’s " massively relieved " by his brother ’s recovery and hopes he can now take time off to full recover . 
He added that the coronavirus pandemic is a good reminder of the need to ensure all frontline workers -- including the NHS , police , bus drivers , and care workers -- get access to proper safety equipment and testing . 
" And we can play our part by just staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives , " Max Johnson said . 
Since the outbreak began , the government has faced intense criticism over lack of testing and protection for frontline workers .
