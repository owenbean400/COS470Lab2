Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese said it ’s unlikely there ’ll be any resolution today to the standoff between local leaders and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s government over new coronavirus restrictions . 
Leese said the standoff could last into the weekend . 
" There were meetings taking place all last weekend and there ’s a very high chance that ’ll be the same here . " 
The UK government wants to move Manchester to the highest alert level -- tier 3 -- but Manchester leaders have rejected the plan , arguing they ’re not convinced it will work and that there needs to be more financial support offered to those affected .
