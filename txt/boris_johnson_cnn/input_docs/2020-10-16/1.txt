Wales could be placed under a short " fire break " lockdown as officials try to curb a sharp rise in cases . 
First Minister Mark Drakeford warned Friday that such a lockdown could last two to three weeks . 
Under the plan , people would be asked to stay in and businesses would close . 
" The shorter the period , the sharper the measures will have to be , " Drakeford said . 
The UK government 's top scientific advisers have also urged ministers to impose a short national lockdown also known as a " circuit breaker . " 
" Doing nothing is not an option , " Drakeford said Friday . 
His comments come after Wales announced that it will ban travelers from high coronavirus hotspots in England , Scotland and Northern Ireland , starting Friday . 
In a tweet , Drakeford said he was introducing the travel ban as there had been " no formal response " from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson after Drakeford sent him two letters asking him to restrict travel into Wales .
