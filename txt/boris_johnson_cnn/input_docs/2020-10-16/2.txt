UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the rise of coronavirus cases in Greater Manchester is " grave " and " worsens with each passing day . " 
Speaking at a press conference from Downing Street on Friday , the Prime Minister said cases in Greater Manchester have doubled in the past nine days and high infection rates are being seen across age groups . 
There were 690 per 100,000 cases in the 16 - to 29 year old bracket and 224 per 100,000 in the over 60 category . 
Johnson added that if the present trends continue , in the next two weeks there " will be more COVID patients in ICU than at the peak of the first wave . " 
He urged the mayor of Manchester , Andy Burnham , to " reconsider his position " and " engage constructively " with the government . 
The Prime Minister did make signs of an ultimatum , saying " if an agreement cannot be reached , I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester ’s hospitals and save the lives of Manchester ’s residents . "
