UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his ministers and advisers his main concern in easing restrictions would be a potential second wave of coronavirus , a government source told CNN . 
Johnson expressed his concern during a two hour Zoom video call with his team on Friday from the UK Prime Minister ’s country residence , Chequers , where he is recovering from the virus . 
On Monday , Johnson 's spokesperson said a potential second peak " is ultimately what will do the most damage to health and economy . 
If you move too fast you risk a second peak . 
The public will expect us to protect life . 
If you have a second peak , it ’s not just damaging for people ’s health but would end up in a second lockdown which would be damaging on the economy . " 
He said the government will be " guided by the science " in terms of when to lift social distancing measures . 
The UK government could however potentially relax some coronavirus restriction measures and strengthen others , when it comes to a second review of the current lockdown , the spokesperson said .
