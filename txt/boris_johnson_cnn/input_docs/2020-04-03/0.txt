British health minister Matt Hancock said he believes that those who have recovered should continue practicing social distancing rules , as more research is needed to understand how immunity works with this particular strain of coronavirus . 
Hancock and Prime Minister Boris Johnson both tested positive for the virus last month . 
" The advice is it ’s highly likely that I ’m now immune or have a very high level of immunity , but it ’s not certain , " Hancock told BBC Radio on Friday . 
" And so I -- like everybody else who ’s been through it -- am social distancing . " 
Hancock said the issue of immunity -- and therefore the antibody test -- will become increasingly important as the UK government looks to wind back the restrictions it has put in place to curb the pandemic .
