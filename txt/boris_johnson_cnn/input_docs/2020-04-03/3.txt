UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will stay in self isolation because he is still showing symptoms of Covid 19 . 
Friday was expected to be Johnson 's final day in self quarantine , after he tested positive for the virus last week . 
But Johnson said he still has a temperature and will remain isolated , as per the country 's guidelines . 
The UK has told people with symptoms or who test positive for Covid 19 to stay in self isolation for seven days , or longer if they are still symptomatic . 
The World Health Organization 's guidelines , by contrast , state people must stay in self isolation for 14 days after they develop symptoms . 
Johnson has been leading his country 's coronavirus response from home while in quarantine . 
His Health Secretary Matt Hancock also tested positive last week , but he has now come out of self isolation . 
In a video posted to Twitter , Johnson also urged people not to go outside as good weather arrives in the UK over the coming days . 
" Everybody may be getting a bit stir crazy , " he said . 
" Please , stick with the guidance , " he said .
