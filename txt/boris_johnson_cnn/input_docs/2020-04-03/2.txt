Prince Charles has officially opened the UK ’s huge temporary hospital for coronavirus patients , describing its rapid construction as a " spectacular and almost unbelievable feat . " 
London 's Ex Ce L conference center has been transformed into a massive health care facility , named the Nightingale Hospital , in under two weeks . 
" ( It ’s ) an example – if ever one was needed – of how the impossible could be made possible , " Charles , the heir to the British throne , said via video link from Scotland . 
The hospital will initially provide up to 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen , though thousands more will soon be ready . 
" In this dark time , this place will be a shining light , " Prince Charles said . 
" It is symbolic of the selfless care and devoted service taking place in innumerable settings , with countless individuals throughout the United Kingdom . " 
Prince Charles says the hospital offers an " intensively practical message of hope " to those who need it most . 
The prince has been self isolating in Scotland after being diagnosed with the coronavirus last month . 
" I was one of the lucky ones to have Covid 19 relatively mildly , " he said . 
" But for some , it will be a much harder journey . 
I am therefore so relieved that everyone can now have the reassurance that they will receive all the necessary technical care they may need and every chance to return to a normal life . " 
Boris Johnson also thanked those involved in building the new hospital on Friday , calling it an " immense effort . "
