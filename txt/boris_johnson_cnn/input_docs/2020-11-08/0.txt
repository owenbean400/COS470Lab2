The UK government has reversed its decision not to extend free school meals for low income families over the Christmas holidays during the coronavirus pandemic , following a campaign by Manchester United and England soccer player Marcus Rashford . 
The forward had called for the UK government to extend a scheme to provide 1.5 million children with food vouchers during holidays until Easter 2021 but the proposal was voted down by lawmakers in the House of Commons in October . 
The football star , who was recently awarded an MBE for his work tackling food poverty , promised to keep up the fight and urged politicians to unite behind the effort . 
The government has now announced a £ 170 million ( $ 223 million ) winter grant to support low income families struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic in England following Rashford ’s campaign . 
Covid 19 response support for the devolved nations -- Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales -- was previously announced . 
The news came after Rashford spoke with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday . 
The footballer on Twitter called it a " great conversation " and said " now is the time for collaboration . " 
" The funding will be ring fenced , with at least 80 % earmarked to support with food and bills , and will cover the period to the end of March . 
Local Authorities will receive the funding at the beginning of December , " a government statement on Sunday said . 
The government announced the £ 170 million as part of a more than £ 400 million package to support low income families , including £ 220 million for a holiday activities and food programme in England to cover Easter , Summer and Christmas in 2021 and an additional funding of £ 16 million for food distribution charities .
