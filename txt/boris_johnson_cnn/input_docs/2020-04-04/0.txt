The UK ’s social distancing rules will remain in force for several more weeks , despite signs the coronavirus outbreak is slowing , one of the country ’s leading epidemiologists has said . 
Professor Neil Ferguson , one of the experts who has been advising the government on its response , told the BBC there ’s been an 85 % drop in the typical number of people movements outside homes since the rules were put in place . 
He says that ’s vital to limiting the spread of the virus . 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the government will continue to keep the social distancing restrictions under review , and relax them " if and when the evidence shows we are able to . " 
Johnson said he has written to the leaders of opposition parties to " invite them to work together at this moment of national emergency . " 
In his letter , Johnson described the coronavirus outbreak as the " biggest threat this country has faced in decades " and one that will take months – not weeks – to fight . 
Renewed calls to stay at home amid sunny forecast : The government is again urging people to stay home during the weekend , despite the temptation to leave because of the nice weather . 
Downing Street posted a warning on Twitter , which said : " If you go out this weekend , you might catch more than the sun . " 
The National Police Chiefs Council ( NPCC ) says patrols will be happening this weekend to encourage people to follow the rules .
