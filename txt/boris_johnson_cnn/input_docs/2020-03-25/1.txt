While Prime Minister Boris Johnson reaffirmed the government 's commitment to increasing the number of coronavirus tests carried out in the UK , Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned that the UK does not have " sufficient testing " capabilities to identify coronavirus cases , telling reporters during a news briefing on Wednesday that there is a " global shortage " of available tests . 
" The thing that we would like to do next — which would certainly make a difference , less to the disease , but definitely to the NHS — is being able to test NHS staff and the critical workers who are self isolating , who currently are not being tested because we do not have sufficient tests , " Whitty added . 
Speaking alongside the chief medical officer , Prime Minister Boris Johnson asserted that the UK is " massively ramping up " its nationwide testing program , and will continue to increase the number of tests carried out each week . 
" We have done many more tests than most other European countries . 
The priority should be , and will be , getting those tests to our frontline staff in the NHS , and we are going to that as quickly as we can , " Johnson said .
