Initial plans for fans to begin the slow integration back into live sporting events in England on October 1 have been postponed , according to UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove . 
A pilot program was initially planned to be rolled out through the month of October , with events restricted to 1,000 people . 
However , due to the rising Covid 19 cases in the country , this will now be delayed . 
New coronavirus measures are scheduled to be set out by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson later today .
