UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the UK has a " moral duty " to reopen schools full time next month for children 's wellbeing . 
Schools in England closed in March , though many remained partially open for vulnerable children and the children of key workers . 
Some pupils in kindergarten , grade 1 and grade 6 went back to school in June . 
Johnson visited schools in East London on Monday . 
Johnson 's comments come after he wrote an article for British newspaper the Mail on Sunday , declaring school reopening a " national priority . " 
He said children were at increased risk of domestic violence , exploitation and addiction if they remained out of school for any longer than necessary . 
Johnson has repeatedly said that the risk of children becoming severely ill from coronavirus is " low , " but safely reopening schools remains a fraught process for officials . 
A key member of the group advising the government on its Covid 19 response said last week that the UK may need to choose between keeping pubs open or allowing schools to reopen , if it wants to keep coronavirus infection rates down .
