The British Prime Minister ’s office has denied that top adviser Dominic Cummings breached coronavirus guidelines , after it emerged he traveled across England to stay at his parents ' home while showing symptoms of coronavirus . 
" At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter , as is being reported , " a spokesperson told CNN on Saturday . 
" His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines . 
Mr . Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally . " 
The spokesman claimed that Cummings went to a house close but separate to his family ’s in northern England , in case help was needed . 
Boris Johnson is under pressure to sack Cummings after it was reported by The Guardian and The Daily Mirror that he and his wife made the trip while showing Covid 19 symptoms . 
Around a week before the trip , Johnson sent the UK into lockdown and banned people from visiting other households . 
" From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction -- you must stay at home , " he said in his March 23 address to the nation . 
" You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home . " 
The government 's guidance on self isolating also makes clear that people should stay at home if they have symptoms of the virus , and encourages people with children to do their best to stick to the guidance . 
But the government spokesperson added : " Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell , it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for . 
" His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed . 
His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside , " the spokesperson added .
