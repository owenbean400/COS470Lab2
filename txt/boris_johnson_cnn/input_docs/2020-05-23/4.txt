The British Prime Minister , Boris Johnson has given his full support to his top adviser Dominic Cummings after he was accused of breaching the government ’s anti coronavirus guidelines . 
Shapps went on to say he did not know if Johnson had been made aware his adviser was traveling 250 miles across the country during the lockdown . 
" I know the PM knew he was unwell and that he was locked down , " he said . 
Shapps also explained the decision made by Cummings was within the guidelines and aimed to provide his child with the necessary support . 
" The reality of the matter is the 4 year old child ’s welfare is I think the important thing , " he said . 
" It was a straightforward arrangement which meant that he stayed in the same place and prevented the possibility of a child , in this case , not having support around him . "
