Restrictions on social contact in the United Kingdom will need to be in place for " at least most of a year " to ensure the coronavirus outbreak is kept under control , the government ’s scientific advisers have said . 
The strict measures on " social distancing , " such as advising people not to socialize in restaurants , closing schools and keeping vulnerable groups at home , will only be effective if used all together and for a prolonged period , they said . 
Otherwise , at the peak of the outbreak , the UK ’s public health service would be overwhelmed . 
The conclusions are contained in a set of papers from Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( SAGE ) , which provides scientific and technical advice to government decision makers during emergencies , published by the government on Friday . 
While Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this week that coronavirus could be beaten within 12 weeks , the documents suggested the effort would last considerably longer . 
Some more background : In a document dated March 16 , the advisers said that isolation and the social distancing of vulnerable groups alone were " very unlikely to prevent critical care facilities being overwhelmed . " 
If the government added school closures and wider social distancing , that " would be likely to control the epidemic when kept in place for a long period " and should be implemented " as soon as practical . " 
It said that authorities could alternate between strict and more relaxed social distancing measures . 
But in total , restrictions would need to be in place for at least a year , with the stricter measures enacted for at least six months . 
The government has been criticized for not making its advice mandatory — particularly in London , where the spread of the virus is more advanced than in the rest of the UK .
