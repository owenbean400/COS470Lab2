Boris Johnson suggested British people will be encouraged to wear face masks when the UK 's lockdown is slowly eased , in a major shift from the government 's previous advice . 
The Prime Minister said he agrees with scientific advice that " face coverings will be useful " when he moves to re open the country 's economy , both for epidemiological reasons and in " giving people confidence " that they can return to work . 
He added that the public would hear more about that next week when he unveils a plan to lift lockdown restrictions . 
The UK has previously not actively told its citizens to wear face masks , in line with the World Health Organization 's guidance but contrary to a growing list of countries that are urging their use .
