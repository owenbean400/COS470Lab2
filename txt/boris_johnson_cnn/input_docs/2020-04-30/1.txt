Boris Johnson has said the UK is " past the peak " of its coronavirus outbreak and is looking towards a lockdown exit strategy , as he led the British government 's coronavirus briefing for the first time since recovering from Covid 19 . 
" We 're past the peak and we 're on the downward slope , " Johnson said . 
" We can now see the sunlight and the pasture ahead of us . " 
He added that he would set out a " comprehensive plan " next week to outline the government 's plans on restarting its economy , re opening schools and enabling Britons to travel to work . 
But he cautioned against easing restrictions too early , which could cause a second peak and lift the virus 's reproduction rate above 1 -- meaning the average person with Covid 19 would infect more than one person on average . 
Johnson said that another 674 people had died from coronavirus in the UK in the past 24 hours . 
But he said more than 81,000 tests were carried out over the past day . 
This is by far the highest daily number to date -- and a vast increase on the country 's testing rates just a few days ago . 
The government had set a target of carrying out 100,000 tests by the end of April , although testing figures only include tests where a result has been confirmed , so it is not yet clear whether that has been reached . 
The Prime Minister also admitted the UK has faced " logistical problems " in getting personal protective equipment to frontline health workers , and " frustrations " in scaling up testing . 
" We are throwing everything at it , heart and soul , night and day " to get it right , Johnson added .
