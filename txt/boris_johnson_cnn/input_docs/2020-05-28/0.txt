Government officials from the UK and Portugal are in contact to possibly establish a so called " air corridor " between the two countries . 
An official from the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign affairs said talks between the two countries began following last week â€™s announcement by the British government that all international arrivals to the UK would be required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival . 
The official also highlighted comments made by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the Liaison Committee of the British Parliament on Wednesday where the Prime Minister said he was open to bilateral agreements for quarantine exemption with " safe countries . "
