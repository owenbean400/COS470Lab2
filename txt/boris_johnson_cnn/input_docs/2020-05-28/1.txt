Britain will begin lifting coronavirus restrictions starting Monday in a phased approach , the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said . 
Johnson warned that the gradual lifting of restrictions is subject to the country keeping the virus under control . 
Here are some of the reopening guidelines outlined by Johnson : Up to six people will be allowed to meet outside " as long as they respect social distancing rules , " in gardens and other private outdoor spaces . 
People from different households should not meet inside homes , Johnson said . 
Schools will reopen to more children including nurseries , pre school , kindergarten and some grades in elementary schools . 
Outdoor markets " where social distancing is easier " and car show rooms can open as well . 
The restrictions will loosen further as of June 15 when retail and nonessential shops can open their doors , as Britain " begins to re start it â€™s economy . " 
Latest numbers : The death rate in the UK is falling consistently , currently at 256 in the last day , down from a peak of 943 on April 14 , but Johnson emphasized the need for the virus to remain under control . 
" I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together . 
And so the changes we are making are limited and cautious . "
