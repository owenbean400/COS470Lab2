The British government has set a noon ( 7 a.m . ET ) deadline to reach an agreement with Manchester today on enacting anti epidemic measures . 
Manchester authorities , including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burham , have been at odds with Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's government about how to handle the recent spike in cases -- and whether to move the city from the UK 's second tier of restrictions to its most severe third tier . 
" The deteriorating public health situation in Greater Manchester means that we need to take action urgently , " Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said in a statement on Monday . 
Burnham has resisted the government 's efforts to increase the severity of his city 's measures , urging for more financial measures to protect workers placed under stricter rules . 
However , Johnson 's government has called on Manchester authorities to enact lockdown like measures in order to stop the virus from spreading . 
The Prime Minister said he would intervene if regional leaders could not reach a deal with the national government .
