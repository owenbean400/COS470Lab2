UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a major new initiative to deliver " jobs , skills and infrastructure " to Britain as its economy reels from the coronavirus crisis . 
In a speech in the West Midlands on Tuesday , Johnson will set out the plan to invest five billion pounds ( approximately $ 6.1 billion ) for infrastructure projects , according to a Downing Street statement previewing the prime minister 's address . 
Johnson is expected to say : " It sounds positively Rooseveltian . 
It sounds like a New Deal . 
All I can say is that if so , then that is how it is meant to sound and to be , because that is what the times demand ... 
This is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus but to using this crisis finally to tackle this country â€™s great unresolved challenges of the last three decades . " 
US President Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal has traditionally been credited with helping lift the nation out of the Great Depression . 
When Roosevelt took office in 1933 , he pushed through a sprawling set of laws and public works programs geared to revive the economy . 
The UK government investment is expected to improve hospital maintenance , eradicate mental health dormitories , build hospitals and improve emergency room capacity , the statement says . 
The money will also be spent on improving the road and rail network , repairing bridges , upgrading schools and maintenance of prisons .
