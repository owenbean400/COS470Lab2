British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that the government should " keep going with an activist , interventionist approach " to help the economy recover from the coronavirus crisis . 
" That 's the way also to get business to be confident , to start investing , to start taking people back and start creating new jobs and driving new growth , " Johnson told reporters . 
What 's happening in the UK : The country has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic , and is trying to stave off its worst downturn in more than 300 years . 
It has one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the world and an economy that is only gradually emerging from lockdown . 
UK GDP contracted by more than 20 % in April , a record , following a 6 % decline in March . 
Meanwhile , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned in June that the UK would suffer the worst downturn of any major economy this year . 
Johnson optimistic : In an earlier interview on the newly launched ‘ Times Radio ’ on Monday morning , the British PM said that " it 's going to be tough " but " the UK is an amazingly dynamic , resilient economy . 
And we 're going to come through it very , very well , indeed . " 
" What we 're going to be doing in the next few months , is really doubling down on our initial agenda , which was all about investment , if you remember in infrastructure , in education , in technology , to bring the country together , " Johnson said . 
" This is a moment now to give our country the skills , the infrastructure , the long term investment that we need , " he added .
