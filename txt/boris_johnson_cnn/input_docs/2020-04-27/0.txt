UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday after recovering from coronavirus , according to a Downing Street spokesperson . 
Dominic Raab , the UK 's Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State , will step aside after deputizing for the Prime Minister , allowing Johnson to make a full return .
