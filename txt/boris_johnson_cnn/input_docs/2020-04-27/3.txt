UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned against relaxing the United Kingdom 's coronavirus restrictions too soon in his first remarks since returning to work after contracting the disease , imploring the nation to " contain your impatience . " 
Speaking outside Downing Street in London , Johnson said that the UK was making progress in tackling the outbreak , with fewer ICU hospital admissions for Covid 19 patients , and " real signs now that we are passing through the peak . " 
The virus has killed more than 20,000 people in the UK . 
But he warned that the UK was at a moment of " maximum risk " as people 's patience might be fraying with the restrictive measures imposed to stop the spread of the virus . 
Johnson said he understood the worries of shopkeepers and entrepreneurs , and that without a functioning economy there was no way of funding the NHS . 
But he warned that he " refused to throw away all the effort and sacrifice of British people " and risk a second peak of the disease and further loss of life by relaxing those restrictions too soon . 
Johnson also thanked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab for deputizing for him , saying : ' ' I 'm sorry I 've been away from my desk for much longer than I would have liked . "
