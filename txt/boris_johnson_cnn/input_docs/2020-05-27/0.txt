The British Housing Secretary , Robert Jenrick , defended top government official Dominic Cummings on Wednesday , amid a national controversy over Cummings breaking lockdown . 
Cummings , a top advisor to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , traveled 260 miles across England in March while his wife was sick with coronavirus symptoms -- at a time when the public was being urged not to leave their homes . 
He added that it was time to " move on " to other matters that the nation needed to focus on . 
" It ’s important obviously that everybody sticks to the rules and acts within the guidelines and Dominic Cummings did do that , " he said . 
" People will disagree with the decisions that he made , many people do , but he did stick to the guidelines , it was within the law . " 
When asked if he was one of those people who disagreed with Cummings ’ decisions , Jenrick said he was " not going to judge how individuals have made those decisions . "
