Several Church of England bishops have criticized UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson after he refused to sack his chief aide Dominic Cummings , who is accused of breaking lockdown restrictions multiple times . 
Cummings drove 260 miles across England in March to stay with his parents while his wife was sick with Covid 19 symptoms . 
His movements , during a time when most of the UK was in lockdown , have sparked a political scandal in Britain . 
Johnson claimed on Sunday that his chief aide acted " responsibly , legally and with integrity . " 
The prime minister 's decision to stand by Cummings has opened up a rare public rift between the UK government and the Church of England . 
" Unless very soon we see clear repentance , including the sacking of Cummings , I no longer know how we can trust what ministers say sufficiently for [ the Church of England ] to work together with them on the pandemic , " Bishop of Manchester David Walker said on Twitter on Sunday evening . 
Bishop of Bristol Vivienne Faul accused Johnson of having " no respect for the people . " 
" The bonds of peace and our common life ... have been dangerously undermined this evening , " she added . 
" I find myself deeply worried by the [ prime minister 's ] judgement call on this one , " said Bishop of Reading Olivia Graham . 
" Not from a political perspective but a moral one . 
His response lacks both integrity and respect and he has just made his task of leading us through this crisis much , much harder . " 
The bishops of Liverpool , Leeds , Newcastle , Ripon and Truro also voiced dismay on Twitter over Johnson 's decision to retain Cummings .
