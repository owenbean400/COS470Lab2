The UK retail sector is set to begin reopening in mid June as part of the government â€™s planned second phase in the gradual relaxation of lockdown restrictions , Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday , giving the go ahead for thousands of stores across the country to prepare to open their doors for business . 
According to a government statement , retail businesses will only be able to open from these dates once they have completed a risk assessment and taken the necessary steps to become Covid 19 secure , in line with current Health and Safety legislation . 
Those businesses failing to implement the safety measures set out by the government could face fines and even jail sentences of up to two years , the statement added . 
" This change will be contingent upon progress against the five tests , and will only be permitted for those premises that are Covid secure , " the prime minister cautioned .
