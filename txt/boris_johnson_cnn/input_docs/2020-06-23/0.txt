Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that people across England will be able to go to restaurants and pubs , hair salons , museums and cinemas from July 4 , in the most significant relaxation of restrictions since they were imposed three months ago . " All hospitality indoors will be limited to table service , and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and limited contact , " Johnson told the House of Commons on Tuesday . 
He added that hair salons could open with appropriate precautions , such as the use of visors . 
" Thanks to our progress we can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England , " he said . 
The PM added that from July 4 , two households of any size would now be able to meet " in any setting inside or out . " 
Current rules only allow groups of up to six people to meet outside , while keeping 2 meters apart . 
Johnson said that while people should still be keeping 2 meters apart when possible , the rule would be reduced to 1 meter if additional mitigation measures were in place .
