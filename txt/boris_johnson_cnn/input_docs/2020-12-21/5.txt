More areas in England could be moved into the Tier 4 level of restrictions , akin to a lockdown , the UK government â€™s Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance has suggested . 
When asked why the whole country is not in lockdown already , if the new variant is more transmissible , Vallance told a Downing Street press conference on Monday : " It is likely that this will grow in numbers of the variant across the country and I think it 's likely , therefore , that measures will need to be increased in some places in due course , and not reduced . " 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hopes children will still return to school in a " staggered way at the beginning of January " but the common sense thing to do is " follow the path of the epidemic keep things under constant review " . 
Johnson said that with a vaccine now being administered , the UK can " look forward to a very different world from Easter onwards . "
