UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to allay fears of food and medicine shortages after the announcement of a new coronavirus variant prompted a chaotic border shutdown for the island nation . 
Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Monday , Johnson said it was vital to stress that border restrictions imposed by the French government on UK freight crossings to France " only affect human handled freight and that ’s only 20 per cent of the freight arriving too and from the European continent . " 
He said the " vast majority of food and medicine supplies are coming and going as normal " to the UK . 
Johnson said he has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron and the UK is " working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade . " 
He added that the risk of transmission of a solitary driver sitting in a cab alone is " very low " and called British supermarket supply chains " strong and robust . " 
On the Pfizer vaccine , Johnson said half a million people have now received their first dose in the UK . 
He gave the press briefing after chairing an emergency COBRA meeting at Downing Street to address the fallout of the new international travel restrictions . 
Speaking alongside the PM , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there were around 500 lorries queuing on a motorway near the port of Dover last night but that ’s now down to about 170 .
