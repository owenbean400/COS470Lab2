UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there is " no reason to think that this new variant of the virus is any more dangerous than the existing strain . " 
During a Downing Street press conference Monday , the UK government ’s Chief Scientific Adviser , Patrick Vallance , said there are three questions surrounding the new variant : does it transmit more readily ? 
Does it alter the disease ’s course ? 
And does it alter the immune system ’s ability to tackle it in in people who ’ve already been exposed to Covid 19 or vaccinated ? 
Vallance said evidence shows transmission is " substantially " increased , although it is not yet clear exactly by how much . 
However , he said there is no evidence that it alters the disease ’s course and there is nothing to suggest the variant wo not have the same susceptibly to antibody attack from a vaccine or pre existing infection exposure . 
" The vaccine looks as though it should be as effective and that ’s obviously being looked at , " Vallance added .
