UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he understands that people will " feel frustrated " by some of the government ’s new coronavirus rules as parts of the country begin to ease restrictions . 
Johnson last week announced the government ’s roadmap to ease coronavirus restrictions in England , but faced criticism for dropping the " stay at home " message and providing confusing advice about what was and was not allowed . 
The UK is made up of four constituent nations , three of which -- Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland -- have not relaxed their " stay at home " orders . 
Officials in Wales and Scotland , neither of which are run by Johnson 's Conservative Party , have criticized the UK government 's response , particularly for creating a potentially confusing mix of rules across mainland Britain , as have other opposition figures . 
Speaking to the BBC on Saturday , Labour leader Keir Starmer warned that the divergence was not going to " help us out of this crisis . " 
" The sooner , frankly , we get back to operating as four nations together the better , " Starmer told the broadcaster . 
Writing in the Mail on Sunday , Johnson said the process will become easier as time passes . 
Johnson said the community needs to understand it could well be living with the virus for " some time to come . " 
He has also announced moves to fast track the development of the Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre through an investment of £ 93 million ( $ 113 million ) .
