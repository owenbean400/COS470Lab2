The R number — which represents the number of people an infected individual passes the virus to — has risen to above one in the northwest of England , according to joint research by University of Cambridge Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit and Public Health England . 
That R number stands at one in the southwest of England , but the number of new infections occurring in the region on a daily basis is " relatively low " according to the study There is " some evidence " that the R number has risen in all regions , scientists found , " probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings . " 
Dr . Yvonne Doyle , Medical Director of Public Health England said in a statement : " Our estimates show that the regional R numbers have increased although they remain below 1 for most of England – this is to be expected as we gradually move out of lockdown . 
It is vital that everyone continues with social distancing , practicing good hand hygiene and must remain at home and order a test if they have symptoms . " 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously stressed the importance of keeping the R rate under one , in order to control the virus . 
In an address to the nation on May 10 when he partially eased coronavirus restrictions Johnson said : " We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease – the R – back up over one , so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago .
