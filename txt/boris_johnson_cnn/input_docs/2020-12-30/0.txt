UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the approval of the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine by the country ’s regulator on Wednesday , adding that the UK would be " out of this by the spring . " 
In an interview with Sky News , Hancock called the approval " fantastic news , " saying that the country ’s National Health Service was " standing ready to deploy , at the sort of pace that is needed to be able to help us to get out of this pandemic by the spring . " 
The vaccine , developed at Oxford University with support from the British Swedish pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca , has become the second to receive approval from the UK ’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . 
Hancock told Sky News that the UK has ordered 100 million doses -- enough to vaccinate the entire population . 
It plans to roll out the vaccines from January 4 , and accelerate the deployment over the first few weeks of the year . 
The health secretary also said the approval of the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine was " good news for the whole world " because of its relatively low cost and storage conditions . 
PM 's praise : UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the approval " truly fantastic news -- and a triumph for British science " on Twitter . 
" We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible , " his tweet read .
