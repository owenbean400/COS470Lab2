The UK government has attempted to play down the prospect of an imminent lockdown in London , a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to rule out stricter measures for the city . 
On Wednesday , multiple government sources told CNN that conservations had taken place in Downing Street discussing measures ranging from shutting down parts of the capital ’s transport network to restricting travel in and out of the city . 
Similar reports appeared across the UK media . 
On Thursday , the Prime Minister ’s spokesman said there was " zero prospect " of any restrictions on travel in and out of London , and that there were " no plans " to shut down its transport network . 
However , the city ’s transport authority had already closed parts of London ’s Tube network , and the government did not rule out introducing further social distancing measures in the coming days . 
Johnson was due to meet the London mayor , Sadiq Khan , on Thursday to discuss plans to fight coronavirus in London , a spokesman for City Hall told CNN . 
Giving evidence to the London assembly on Thursday , Khan said too many Londoners were failing to follow official advice . 
" We are clearly still in the early phase of this crisis but the spread of the virus is at a more advanced stage in London than in other parts of the country . 
This means that further measures will need to be introduced at the point at which they will have the biggest effect , " he said .
