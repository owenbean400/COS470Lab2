The United Kingdom will " soon " introduce a quarantine period on people coming into the country by air , Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Sunday . 
Some context : In a statement to CNN on Saturday , the chief executive of the UK Airport Operators Association , Karen Dee , warned that the introduction of a quarantine period could have a " devastating impact " on the UK aviation industry . 
Dee continued : " Airports have done their utmost to stay open through this crisis to provide vital services to communities -- from facilitating freight and repatriations to air ambulance , police , Royal Mail and HM Coastguard services -- but cannot survive a further protracted period without passengers that would be the result of quarantine measures . 
If quarantine is a necessary tool for fighting Covid 19 , then the Government should act decisively to protect the hundreds of thousands of airport related and travel related jobs across the UK . "
