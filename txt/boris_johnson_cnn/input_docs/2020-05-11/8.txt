The UK ’s leading scientific advisers have warned that the prospect of a coronavirus vaccine cannot be taken for granted . 
Speaking alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the government ’s daily press briefing , chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said " you can never guarantee that you ’re going to get a vaccine , " but added that " great progress has been made " in various countries . 
He also referred to trials of drug treatments around the world . 
" I ’d be surprised if we did not end up with something , " he said . 
Vallance said that around 130,000 people may currently be infected with Covid 19 , according to early results from a randomized set of swab tests sent to thousands of homes . 
That data has a wide margin of error , but Vallance said it suggests that " maybe 10 % " of people in London have had the virus , and " somewhere around 4 % " of people outside London may have had it .
