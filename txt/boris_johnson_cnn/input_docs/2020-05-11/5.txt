The UK government published a three step coronavirus recovery plan , a day after a speech by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was widely criticized for being vague . 
The planned stages start with a first easing on Wednesday , followed by potential further steps on June 1 and " not before July 4 , " depending on conditions at the time . 
Here 's what 's happening in each step : Phase 1 : Beginning Wednesday , people will be allowed to leave the house for outdoor recreation and leisure with members of their household , and individuals can meet with one other person outside their household . 
People in England can also drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance . 
Workers who cannot work from home should travel to work if their workplace is open — ideally not traveling on public transport . 
Phase 2 : Beginning June 1 , the UK will allow " non essential retail " businesses to reopen if it is safe for them to follow social distancing guidelines . 
The government said some schools should also prepare to begin to open for more children from June 1 . 
Phase 3 : Depending on how the initial easing of restrictions impacts the UK ’s infection rate , the UK government may allow more businesses to open in July , no earlier than July 4 . 
" The precise timetable for these adjustments will depend on the infection risk at each point , and the effectiveness of the Government ’s mitigation measures like contact tracing , " said the government document . 
" Initially , the gap between steps will need to be several weeks , to allow sufficient time for monitoring . "
