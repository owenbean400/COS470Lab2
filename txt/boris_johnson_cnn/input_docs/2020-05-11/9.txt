UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he hopes the UK will achieve a vaccine for Covid 19 and that he is " hearing positive noises coming from Oxford , but this is not guaranteed . " 
Speaking at the UK ’s daily coronavirus briefing , Johnson said that he believes that after " 18 years we do not have a vaccine for SARS . " 
Sir Patrick Vallance , chief scientific adviser to the UK , backed up the prime minister saying , " You can never guarantee a vaccine – it is tough . " 
Vallance did admit there had been good strides made as some vaccines are now in clinics and that there had been good progress but that " you never know until you have one . "
