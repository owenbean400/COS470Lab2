Boris Johnson has faced scrutiny from lawmakers over his tentative plan to restart Britain 's economy , which has been criticized from many corners for causing confusion . 
The UK prime minister defended parts of his recovery plan in a speech to Parliament , which he first unveiled in a televised address on Sunday night , telling MPs : " We have begun our descent from the peak of the epidemic but our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous . " 
Johnson said people would now be encouraged to wear face coverings in some public places , such as shops â€” a reversal of the government 's previous position . 
And he admitted that lockdown measures may be lifted at different times in different parts of the country , saying his government will pursue a " flexible response . " 
Leaders in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland have resisted some of Johnson 's reopening measures in recent days . 
But he was pressed by the opposition leader Keir Starmer over the government 's mixed messaging , which has caused confusion over what British people are permitted to do in public , and when workers who cannot do their jobs from home should return to their workplaces . 
" What the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and at the moment both are in pretty short supply , " Starmer said . 
" At the heart of the problem it seems is that the Prime Minister made a statement last night before the plan was written , or at least finalized . "
