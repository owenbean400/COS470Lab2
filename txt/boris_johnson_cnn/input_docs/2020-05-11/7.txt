British people will be allowed to spend more time outdoors starting on Wednesday , Boris Johnson has confirmed in Parliament , as he batted back calls for the government to spell out its reopening plan in more detail . 
Johnson told MPs there is a " lower risk outdoors than indoors " and said people can swim in the sea and in lakes and exercise outdoors as much as they like . 
" I do hope that 's clear , " he added , acknowledging criticism that the government ’s plan has left people in the UK confused about what they can and ca not do outdoors . 
Previously , the government ’s guidelines had only allowed for one piece of outdoor exercise per day , although its legislation made no mention of how often people could exercise . 
Johnson also said he is increasing fines for people who break the lockdown rules . 
Penalties will now begin at £ 100 — or about $ 123 USD — and double on each infringement , up to £ 3,600 ( or about $ 4,460 USD ) . 
The prime minister added that his government is asking its scientific advisers about when people from two different households can mix on an exclusive basis , suggesting that could be allowed starting on June 1 . 
And he said sporting events , such as the Premier League , could potentially return in empty stadiums on the same date — a prospect that Johnson said would provide a " much needed boost " for the country . 
Johnson ’s government has dropped its " stay home " slogan for a message encouraging people to " stay alert , " as it seeks to slowly creep out of lockdown . 
But his efforts were attacked by opposition leaders . 
Ian Blackford , the Scottish National Party ’s Westminster leader , asked Johnson not to use the new slogan in Scotland , Wales or Northern Ireland unless regional governments there agree . 
" It is obvious that the last 24 hours has spread confusion , " Blackford said . 
" Mixed messaging risks lives . " 
Johnson replied that " staying alert " was a " valid piece of advice .
