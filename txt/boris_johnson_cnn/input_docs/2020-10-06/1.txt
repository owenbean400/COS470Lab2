The UK has recorded a further 14,542 coronavirus cases on Tuesday , representing an increase of 1,948 cases compared to the day before . 
This rise comes as the UK government continues to deal with the fallout from a technical issue with its recording system which almost caused 16,000 cases to go unreported over the weekend . 
According to UK government data , 76 additional fatalities from the virus have been recorded , bringing the official UK death toll to 42,445 deaths . 
At least 19 deaths were recorded the day before . 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a televised interview Monday that the higher case numbers " really correspond to pretty much were we thought we were , " adding that " the slightly lower numbers " the UK had previously recorded " did not really reflect where we thought the disease was likely to go .
