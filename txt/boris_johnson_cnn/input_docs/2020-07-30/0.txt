British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was " absolutely vital " for people in the UK not to " delude ourselves into thinking we are out of the woods or that this is somehow all over " as Europe feels the initial ripples of a second coronavirus wave . 
Speaking during a visit to North Yorkshire in England on Thursday , Johnson said the way to avoid a " damaging second wave " was to adhere to social distancing guidelines , practice regular hand washing , and wear face masks on public transport and in shops . 
Johnson said that despite the fact that death numbers in the UK " are well down , " his message to Britons remained " do not lose focus , do not lose discipline , continue to follow those guidelines , and if you have symptoms get a test . " 
The Prime Minister said he was monitoring the " resurgence of the virus in some other European countries " and the rising case numbers in the United States . 
He said consequently it was " absolutely vital " that Britons " do not delude ourselves into thinking we are out of the woods or that this is somehow all over . " 
Johnson also strongly encouraged Britons experiencing any coronavirus symptoms to get a test . 
This comes after an announcement from the chief medical officers of the four UK nations Monday , stipulating that anyone experiencing Covid 19 symptoms must now self isolate for ten days rather than the previously advised seven . 
Addressing recent flare ups of the virus in areas such as Oldham , Johnson said he knew it was " tough " for residents but that " the best way to deal with this is if we have tough local lockdowns . " 
He paid tribute to the " the efforts of local people in many , many places across the country from Kirklees to Ashford " working to get the virus under control .
