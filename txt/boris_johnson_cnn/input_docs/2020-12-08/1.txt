" It ’s amazing to see the vaccine come out , it ’s amazing to see this tremendous shot in the arm for the entire nation , but we ca not afford to relax now , " Johnson said during a visit to a newly opened vaccination center in London . 
" It is important for people to understand that the virus is alas still rising in some parts of the country , " the Prime Minister continued , adding that the vaccine will " gradually make a huge difference " to the national infection rate . 
The UK is the first Western nation to begin vaccinating its citizens against Covid 19 , less than a week after approving the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine . 
Asked whether he would be receiving the vaccine , the Prime Minister told reporters that he is " not in the priority group " outlined by the British government , but encouraged those who are eligible to take the vaccine . 
" I would just say to all those who are scared , do not be…you see people take the vaccine this morning , in large numbers , people are going to be taking it in the next few days and and weeks and there is nothing to be nervous about , " Johnson said .
