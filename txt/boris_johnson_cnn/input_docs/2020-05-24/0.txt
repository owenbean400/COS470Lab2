British police have confirmed that an officer made contact with the father of Dominic Cummings – a senior adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson – regarding his trip to Durham during the nationwide lockdown , the Press Association reported Saturday . 
This information contradicts an earlier statement from Downing Street , which asserted that the police made no contact with Cummings or his family . 
An officer spoke with the father of Cummings , who said that his son had traveled to the northeast of England and was " self isolating in part of the property , " according to Durham Police , the PA reported Saturday . 
This comes after Downing Street issued a statement regarding Cummings ' trip to Durham , asserting that " at no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter , as is being reported . " 
Cummings has come under fire for reportedly traveling to Durham – more than 250 miles from his home in London – on two occasions , despite national lockdown regulations . 
Downing Street has denied these reports , featured in the Mirror and Guardian newspapers , saying they contain " false allegations " and " inaccurate stories " about Cummings . 
" His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines . 
Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally , " according to a statement from Downing Street .
