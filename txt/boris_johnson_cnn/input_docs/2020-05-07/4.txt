Britain 's easing of coronavirus restrictions will be " carefully monitored , " and if the rate of infection goes up , restrictive measures will be reintroduced , the government said today . 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce the roadmap for Britain 's reopening on Sunday , along with conditions needed to reach each new phase . 
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said today the initial changes will be " modest and incremental " . 
The government has pledged to review coronavirus restrictions every three weeks , with the next review due today . 
But Raab clarified current measures will stay in place until the Prime Minister 's address to the nation on Sunday . 
The rate of virus reproduction — the R0 number — in the UK right now is between 0.5 and 0.9 , Raab said , and it 's probably at its lowest in London , chief statistician at the Office for National Statistics Sir Ian Diamond added . 
The R0 is the average number of other people infected by each patient . 
The overall number of cases and deaths is steadily falling , Raab said , but he warned the virus is not yet beaten . 
The UK 's coronavirus death toll has risen by 539 to reach 30,615 .
