The UK 's lockdown measures are still being debated and nothing is finalized , but the country 's stay at home message is likely to be eased this weekend , an official familiar with the deliberations told CNN . 
The official said changes would likely include allowing Britons to expand their social groups . 
It was still being discussed how that expansion would be defined . 
The UK has the second highest death toll from the virus in the world following the US . 
The official was confident that Sunday would see the UK government dropping " stay at home " as a core part of its message . 
They said shops including hardware stores or garden centers — mostly outdoor stores — would probably be allowed to reopen . 
Pubs , cafes , restaurants and department stores were not expected to reopen for the foreseeable future . 
Separately , Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s spokesperson said the UK will " advance with maximum caution " when it does begin easing coronavirus restrictions . 
The spokesman added the British Prime Minister wanted to maintain a " four nation approach , " regarding the lifting of restrictions . 
Earlier , Scotland 's leader Nicola Sturgeon said it is her " preference " for all four UK governments to make changes at the same point but if Johnson decides to move at a faster pace she will respect his decision . 
Johnson 's spokesperson said a four nation approach for England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales provides " the best way forward . " 
The UK economy is heading for its worst crash in more than 300 years because of the pandemic according to a new forecast from the Bank of England . 
The spokesperson acknowledged the toll the current measures were having on the British economy , but reiterated the warning that a second spike would be even more devastating .
