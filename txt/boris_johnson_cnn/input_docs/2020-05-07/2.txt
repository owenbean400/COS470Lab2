Scotland â€™s leader said lockdown measures there be extended another three weeks , until at least the end of May . First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the reproduction rate of the virus in the country , known as the " R rate , " is still " hovering around 1 " . 
She said easing up now could be " very risky " . 
What that means : A reproduction rate of one means each person with coronavirus will infect an average of one other person . 
Sturgeon said Scotland may be behind other parts of the UK . 
For us to drop the clear , well understood stay at home message right now could be a potentially catastrophic mistake , " Sturgeon said . 
She said the measures will be reviewed on a weekly basis and are currently due to end three weeks from now , on May 28 . 
Responding to British media reports that the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson may announce a change to lockdown measures on Sunday , Sturgeon said she would not agree to a change in messaging around staying at home . 
She added other suggested changes about encouraging people back to work " would not in my judgement be safe to make " . 
During the daily Edinburgh briefing , Sturgeon said she may be prepared to agree with a change of guidance about exercising . 
British media have reported people across the UK may be allowed to exercise outside more than once daily from Monday . 
The First Minister said it is her " preference " for all four UK governments to make changes at the same point but if Johnson decides to move at a faster pace she will respect his decision . 
" I will not be pressured into lifting restrictions prematurely before I am certain we will not be risking a resurgence , " Sturgeon said .
