The UK government will scrap its stay at home advice as part of the plan to gradually ease coronavirus restrictions , UK media reported on Wednesday evening . 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs earlier in the day that he will be lifting some restrictive measures starting next Monday , and will officially announce the details on Sunday . 
Johnson will expand the once a day limit on exercise to allow " unlimited " exercise either individually or with members of the same household , The Telegraph reported . 
He will also encourage people to go back to work if they can do it safely , and in a divergence to the strategy pursued by the government so far , he will tell those using public transport to use face coverings where social distancing is not possible , according to The Telegraph . 
The Scottish government has already recommended use of face coverings in crowded spaces . 
Schools could start a " phased " return of pupils at the beginning of June , but restaurants , bars and cafes have not been given a firm date for reopening , The Telegraph reported .
