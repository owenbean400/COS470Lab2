The worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come in the UK , the British Prime Minister said on Thursday . 
" The most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads , " Boris Johnson said at news conference to announce the UK â€™s move to the " delay " phase of its coronavirus action plan . 
" The virus is more dangerous than seasonal flu and more people are going to get it . 
More families will lose loved ones , " Johnson warned . 
Under the plan , if the UK is able to delay the " peak " of the virus by a " few weeks , " the National Health System will be better positioned to handle it , he said . 
If the peak is delayed until the weather is warmer , there will be less people suffering from respiratory tract related illnesses and would put the NHS in a " stronger state . "
