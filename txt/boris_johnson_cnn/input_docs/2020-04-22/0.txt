Britain 's first virtual sitting of Parliament began with the First Secretary of State coming under intense scrutiny over the UK 's jarring shortage of coronavirus testing . 
Dominic Raab , who is standing in for Boris Johnson while the Prime Minister recovers from Covid 19 , said the government is making " good progress " and would meet its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April . 
But opposition leader Keir Starmer , making his first appearance in the House of Commons since winning the Labour leadership election earlier this month , criticized the government 's pace and pointed out the UK is " way behind " other European nations on testing . 
He noted that a mere 18,206 tests were carried out on Monday , with just over a week until the end of April -- to which Raab responded that the UK 's capacity for tests is at 40,000 a day . 
" I think it ’s really important that we fully understand what the First Secretary just said , " Starmer said . 
" That means that the day before yesterday , 40,000 could have been carried out , but only 18,000 tests were actually carried out . " 
" All week I ’ve heard from the frontline , from care workers , who are frankly desperate for tests for their residents and for themselves , " Starmer said . 
" They would expect every test to be used every day … so there ’s clearly a problem . 
Why is not the government using all the tests available ? " 
Criticism over the number of tests carried out , and over shortfalls in protective equipment for health care workers , has been leveled at the government throughout its coronavirus response . 
Raab and Starmer , along with a handful of other MPs , were present in the chamber and sat a safe distance from each other . 
Most lawmakers joined the session remotely , via a video conference service .
