United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has " absolutely been leading our nation ’s effort to combat the coronavirus " since the moment " it became clear that there were challenges in terms of coronavirus developing in China , " Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said at the Downing Street press conference Sunday . 
In response to a question over Johnson ’s lack of attendance at five Cobra meetings in January and February , Williamson said Johnson has been " making sure that resources and money is not an issue or concern for any department , especially for health services . " 
Cobra refers to interdepartmental government meetings called in times of crisis . 
Johnson first chaired a coronavirus Cobra meeting on March 2 . 
" But the focus that the prime minister was putting on this , and has continued to put on this , has meant that this is the whole government effort , " he added . 
Williamson responded to criticism about the government ’s response to acquiring personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . 
He said the government has been trying to secure PPE " from the first moment " scientific advice highlighted " we were facing a real challenge in terms of the coronavirus . " 
" What we have seen over the last few months is an enormous effort – it ’s a national effort , but also an international effort to secure PPE from right around the globe , " he added .
