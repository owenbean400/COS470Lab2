A UK government spokesman has refuted wide ranging claims made by The Sunday Times in a damning article that criticizes the government ’s early response to the coronavirus pandemic , arguing Sunday that the article contains a " series of falsehoods " that " misrepresent " the government 's actions . 
" The Prime Minister has been at the helm of the response to this , providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation , " the statement added . 
The spokesman ’s response comes after Cabinet minister Michael Gove acknowledged that -- as reported by the Sunday Times -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not attend five national security COBR meetings focused on coronavirus in January and February . 
According to the government ’s spokesman , it is " entirely normal and proper " for such meetings to be chaired by the relevant secretary of state , as opposed to the Prime Minister . 
" It is ridiculous to suggest that coronavirus only reached the UK because the Health Secretary and not the PM chaired a COBR meeting , " the spokesman said . 
Additionally , The Sunday Times reported that a number of opportunities to reduce the impact of the pandemic had been missed by the UK government in January , February and March , claiming that UK officials " sleepwalked into disaster " and " played down the looming threat " of coronavirus . 
The government ’s spokesman rejected such claims , asserting the government " started to act as soon as it was alerted to a potential outbreak " of coronavirus . 
" The suggestion that the government ’s attitude was nonchalant is wrong . 
Extensive and detailed work was going on in government because of coronavirus , " the spokesman said . 
" The government ’s scientific advisory groups started to meet in mid January and ( Health Secretary Matt ) Hancock instituted daily meetings to grip the emerging threat . 
We have taken the right steps at the right time guided by the scientific evidence , " the spokesman added .
