British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the rise in infection rates in some countries relaxing their lockdowns is a " very clear warning " for the UK " not to proceed too fast or too recklessly " . 
In reaction to videos of packed London buses circulating this morning , Johnson said he does not want to see crowding on public transport in the UK . 
" We are working very actively with Tf L [ Transport for London ] to ensure that what we do is we have more capacity , we discourage people from going to work during the peak , and that operators — particularly TFL — lay on more tube trains when those are necessary throughout the day , " Johnson told lawmakers in parliament . 
Some background : Today marks the first day people are allowed to return to work if they cannot work from home after Johnson laid out his vision for gradually reopening the economy in an address televised on Sunday . 
The government 's previous stance was that people should only go to work " if they must , " Johnson said in Sunday 's address , adding " we now need to stress that anyone who ca not work from home , for instance those in construction or manufacturing , should be actively encouraged to go to work .
