The steroid dexamethasone can save one life for every eight patients treated for Covid 19 , with the whole treatment only costing around $ 50 dollars , one of the leaders of the Oxford University study said Tuesday at the UK government briefing . 
" If we treat eight patients in intensive care with this drug , we ’ll save one life . 
And the total cost of treating all eight patients is only about 40 [ British ] pounds – so this is really really remarkable and we ’re extremely pleased with this result , " Hornby said , standing alongside British Prime Minister Boris Johnson . 
Hornby said that when administered to ventilated Covid 19 patients over ten days , it reduces the risk of death by about 35 % . 
Describing dexamethasone as an " old drug – some people would say it ’s a boring drug , " Hornby said the drug had different effects on different groups . 
" In ventilated patients with Covid 19 the drug dexamethasone – so 10 days of treatment with that which is tablet or injection – it reduces risk of death by about 35 % . 
In patients on the ward who require oxygen and have Covid , it reduces the risk of death by about 20 % . 
That covers about 75 % of patients in the hospital who would receive a mortality benefit from using this drug , " Hornby said standing alongside Johnson .
