The UK government has reversed its decision to not extend free school meal vouchers throughout the summer holidays . 
The announcement comes after a prominent English football player criticized the UK over a lack of free meals for children over the summer . 
Britain provides free school meal vouchers for low income families but the program was due to finish at the end of the current academic year in July . 
Manchester United and England star Marcus Rashford had pleaded with lawmakers to extend the scheme through the summer for low income families . 
A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday that there would now be a so called summer food fund . 
The spokesperson added that Johnson understood the issues families were facing during the pandemic and that the expected costs for the fund were expected to be around 120 million pounds ( about $ 152 million ) . 
Johnson initially rejected the idea . 
Rashford then wrote to lawmakers urging them to " put their rivalries aside " and make a U turn as many families continue to struggle with the economic impact of the coronavirus . 
Following up on the open letter he published Monday , Rashford wrote an article in The Times newspaper asking MPs to " help us break the cycle of hardship " of child poverty in the UK . 
Downing Street 's comments were first reported by Reuters and confirmed by CNN . 
Rashford reacted to Tuesday 's announcement on Twitter : " I do not even know what to say , " Rashford said in the tweet . 
" Just look at what we can do when we come together , THIS is England in 2020 . "
