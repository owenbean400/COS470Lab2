The UK leader announced that the government 's plan for moving forward during the pandemic will be presented to Parliament on Sunday , in the hope that some new measures to ease the country 's lockdown will be adopted the following day . 
He did not explicitly mention any particular measures , but his comments hint at a relaxation of the country 's lockdown . 
" We want , if we possibly can , to get going with some of these measures on Monday , " he said , ensuring MPs that the House would be fully informed and have the opportunity to debate the plan . 
The comment came during the leader 's first Prime Minister 's Questions session since he was released from hospital , where he was treated for coronavirus in an intensive care unit . 
He faced his new opponent , Labour leader Keir Starmer , in person , as well as several MPs asking questions over video conference , some of whom framed the the country 's confirmed death toll as a symbol of the government 's failed response . 
The UK now has the second highest death toll in the world and the highest in Europe .
