The British government has promised to provide £ 330 billion ( $ 400bn ) in loans and guarantees to businesses , as Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to act like he is leading a " wartime government " and do " whatever it takes to support our economy . " 
Business rates will be put on hold for a year , the chancellor Rishi Sunak added at a daily coronavirus press conference on Tuesday evening , and mortgage lenders will also offer a three month " mortgage holiday " for those struggling due to coronavirus . 
Sunak added that he will talk with the UK 's transport secretary to discuss an economic package for airlines and airports , which are struggling around the world as sweeping travel restrictions are put in place . 
The finance minister said the pandemic has caused an " economic emergency " as well as a public health one , and Johnson added that , in addition to the " extreme " measures previously announced , " we may well have to go further and faster in the coming days . " 
Johnson advised Britons to avoid pubs , restaurants and theaters , and said they should limit social contact on Monday . 
Earlier on Tuesday , the government also advised against non essential foreign travel . 
But some have questioned why Britain has been slower to enact more draconian restrictions , as many European nations have . 
Sunak said pubs , bars and theaters with insurance that cover pandemics will be allowed to make insurance claims against their policy . 
For those that are not covered , there will be a £ 25,000 cash grant per business to help " bridge this period " for the likes of shops , music venues and theaters . 
But he did not go as far as countries such as France , which earlier this week waived utility bills and rents for citizens struggling during the crisis .
