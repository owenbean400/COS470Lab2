The British government has warned that the coronavirus outbreak is spreading faster than it initially predicted , London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Tuesday . 
The spread of the virus across the UK capital is " a few weeks ahead " of the rest of the country , Khan also said , citing guidance given by the government at Monday 's emergency ' COBRA ' meeting . 
" I was told by the government , and the government 's advisers , that London is a few weeks ahead of the rest of the country , and the way that this virus is spreading is faster than the government and advisers had thought , " Khan said during an interview with ITV â€™s Good Morning Britain . 
" We can understand why London is further ahead than the rest of the country , because of our connectivity , our global travel , our density , " Khan said , highlighting that 23 people have so far died in London after contracting the virus . 
" I think the advice given by the government now is the right advice ... we 've got to take sensible to steps to avoid the virus spreading faster , " the mayor added . 
Khan 's remarks come just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus , advising against all unnecessary social contact . 
" Now is the time for everyone to stop non essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel , " Johnson said Monday . 
" We need people to start working from home where they possibly can and you should avoid pubs , clubs , theatres and other such social venues , " he said .
