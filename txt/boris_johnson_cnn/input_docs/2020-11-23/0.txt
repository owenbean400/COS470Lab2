UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday is expected to announce an " extensive community testing " program for regions living under the " very high alert " top tier of Covid restrictions , as well as offering testing support from the National Health Service ( NHS ) and the armed forces . 
The government â€™s Covid Winter Plan will employ repeated testing of contacts so that they can avoid the need to isolate after having contact with a positive individual , according to a Downing Street news release . 
The release said the program of " repeated testing of contacts instead of isolation " will be trialed in Liverpool starting next week and then expanded across the NHS and care homes in December before being rolled out to the general population in January . 
The expanded availability of testing under the Covid Winter Plan will allow care home residents to see two visitors twice a week , the release said . 
Johnson will announce that testing will be expanded to catch asymptomatic individuals who can still spread the virus and that weekly testing will be available for employees in food manufacturing , prison staff , and workers delivering and administering Covid vaccines .
