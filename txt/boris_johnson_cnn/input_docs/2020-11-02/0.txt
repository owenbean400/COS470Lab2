UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday warning lawmakers that coronavirus deaths in the winter could be twice as high as during the first wave of the outbreak , according to Britain 's Press Association . 
The news agency reports that Johnson will say there is no alternative but to impose a recently announced lockdown in England . 
" Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now , we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave , " Johnson is expected to say , according to PA . 
" Faced with these latest figures , there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level . " 
The new lockdown , which is set to come into effect in England from Thursday morning , following a vote in Parliament Wednesday , will see all bars and restaurants closed except for takeout and delivery , as well as the closure of all non essential businesses including gyms and hair salons . 
Schools , universities and childcare facilities will remain open . 
Residents will only be allowed to leave their homes for specific purposes including education , work ( if they cannot work from home ) , exercise , medical issues , or to buy food and essential items . 
Johnson will say on Monday that the Government will " seek to ease restrictions " on December 2 when the lockdown period is scheduled to end , PA reported . 
However , UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove said Sunday that England 's second lockdown could be extended beyond December 2 .
