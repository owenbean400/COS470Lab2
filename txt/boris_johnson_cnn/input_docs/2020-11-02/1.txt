Nigel Farage , the politician best known for championing Britain 's exit from the European Union , plans to relaunch his Brexit Party as an anti lockdown party called Reform UK . 
Farage and Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice attacked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson â€™s response to the pandemic in a joint article in The Daily Telegraph newspaper : They went on to claim that " lockdowns do not work " and " cause more harm than good . " 
The article comes just days before a fresh lockdown is expected to come into force in England . 
The UK 's parliament will vote on the restrictions on Wednesday ; if approved , the new lockdown will begin hours later . 
The proposals have generated a backlash within Johnson 's own Conservative party , with many MPs opposed to the move . 
Farage and Tice are instead calling for a Swedish style herd immunity approach , hailng its " considerable success , " despite Sweden reporting record Covid 19 case numbers and announcing further restrictions last week . 
The UK has seen some anti lockdown protests , but a You Gov poll released Sunday suggested that 72 % of people in England back Johnson 's plan to return to stricter measures . 
Reform UK currently has no elected representatives ; its proposed name change is subject to approval from the UK 's Electoral Commission .
