The coronavirus situation is " building up nationally " across England , with hospitals in northern regions especially at risk of being overwhelmed by ICU patients , UK health officials warned during a data briefing on Monday . 
" In the last four weeks , hospitals in the northwest and the northeast [ of England ] have witnessed a seven fold increase in Covid patients in their Intensive Care Units , " Steve Powis , the medical director for the National Health Service ( NHS ) England , said . 
Several so called " Nightingale " hospitals , which were specially built across the country to combat the first coronavirus wave , have been told to prepare for more patients . 
Some context : The data briefing took place ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s expected announcement of a new three tier system of coronavirus restrictions , with several areas in the north expecting to face the strictest measures . 
The UK ’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam warned the virus is already spreading southwards . 
" It has changed in a matter of just a few days ... 
That is clearly a matter of great concern to me , " Van Tam said . 
He also warned that although infections were initially highest among 16 - to 29 year olds , they are " creeping up " among the older generations , adding the pattern is likely to continue across the rest of the country . 
Powis added that " the claim that without taking further action the elderly can somehow just be fenced off from risk I ’m afraid is proving to be wishful thinking . " 
He did stress that people should still use the National Health Service for non coronavirus medical needs but said controlling infections within communities is necessary to maintain current services and avoid having to once again cancel non urgent surgeries . 
The UK reported 12,872 new positive cases as of Sunday .
