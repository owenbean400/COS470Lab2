British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce new measures on Wednesday to reduce the number of people legally allowed to socially gather from 30 to six in England to control the coronavirus spread . 
The new lower limit , due to take effect starting Monday , will make it easier for police to identify and disperse illegal gatherings of more than six people unless it meets one of the exemptions . 
Exemptions include , a household or support bubble larger than six , if gatherings are for work or education purposes , weddings , funerals , or organized team sports . 
" It is absolutely critical that people now abide by these rules and remember the basics â€“ washing your hands , covering your face , keeping space from others , and getting a test if you have symptoms . " 
The statement added the new measures are supported by the government , Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance after the UK has seen the number of daily coronavirus cases rise to almost 3,000 . 
On Tuesday , Britain recorded an increase of 2,460 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours , bringing the total number of cases to 352,560 .
