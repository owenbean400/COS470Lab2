Cases are rising in universities just weeks after students returned to campuses : more than 1,000 students at Newcastle University tested positive for Covid 19 over an eight day period , along with another 770 cases at the University of Northumbria , while three universities in north England have stopped face to face teaching . 
Concerns about the rise in cases and the testing system were not helped by a cabinet minister having to admit on Wednesday that the country is experiencing supply chain issues with a pharmaceutical company that supplies tests to the UK .
