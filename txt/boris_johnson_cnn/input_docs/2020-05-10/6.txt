The leaders of the United Kingdom ’s devolved nations – Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland – have rejected Boris Johnson ’s revised coronavirus guidance , which now advises citizens to " stay alert " as opposed to " stay at home " to control the outbreak , the Press Association ( PA ) reported Sunday . 
According to the Press Association , the three leaders said they had not been consulted over the new government guidance ahead of a national security meeting on Sunday morning . 
In a Tweet , Scotland ’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that she had first seen the prime minister ’s new " stay alert " slogan in the Sunday newspapers . 
" It is of course for him to decide what ’s most appropriate for England but , given the critical point we are at in tackling the virus , # Stay Home Save Lives remains my clear message to Scotland at this stage , " Sturgeon added . 
Her Welsh counterpart , Mark Drakeford , said that Wales will not be dropping the " stay at home " message from its policy on containing the spread of coronavirus , while Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said she will continue to promote the " stay at home " message , according to the PA . 
" We ’re not out of the woods . 
It ’s about steady progress , rather than making a dash for the exit , " Foster tweeted .
