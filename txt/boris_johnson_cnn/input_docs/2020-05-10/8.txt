United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled the " careful steps " the government will take to ease the emergency restrictions implemented as part of the nationwide lockdown , relaxing the government ’s stay at home order and allowing some people to return to work . 
" From this Wednesday , we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise , " Johnson said during his address to the nation on Sunday . 
In his taped address from Downing Street , the prime minister also confirmed that all those who are unable to work from home — such as those in construction and manufacturing — will be " actively encouraged " to return to work as of Monday . 
" Work from home if you can , but you should go to work if you ca not work from home and when you do go to work , if possible , do so by car or , even better , by walking or bicycle , " Johnson said . 
" We want it to be safe for you to get to work , so you should avoid public transport if at all possible , because we must and will maintain social distancing , and capacity will therefore be limited . " 
While the stay at home order has been relaxed , Johnson affirmed that there will be " no immediate end " to the nationwide lockdown . 
" This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week…we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures , " Johnson said . 
" It would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike…we must stay alert . 
We must continue to control the virus and save lives , " he added . 
According to the prime minister , all modifications in the government ’s restrictions will be monitored closely at a local , regional and national level so as to avoid the risk of a second peak . 
" If there are outbreaks , if there are problems , we will not hesitate to put on the brakes , " Johnson asserted .
