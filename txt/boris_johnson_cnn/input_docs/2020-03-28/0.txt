Richard Horton , the editor in chief of The Lancet medical journal on Saturday slammed the UK government 's response to the coronavirus pandemic , saying it had " failed . " 
" The UK Government 's Contain–Delay–Mitigate–Research strategy failed . 
It failed , in part , because ministers did not follow WHO 's advice to " test , test , test " every suspected case . 
They did not isolate and quarantine . 
They did not contact trace . 
These basic principles of public health and infectious disease control were ignored , for reasons that remain opaque , " Horton wrote in an article published to the medical journal on Saturday . 
" The UK now has a new plan—Suppress–Shield–Treat–Palliate . 
But this plan , agreed far too late in the course of the outbreak , has left the NHS wholly unprepared for the surge of severely and critically ill patients that will soon come , " he added . 
An increase in cases : British health authorities announced another 181 fatalities on Friday , bringing the death toll to 759 . 
More than 14,500 infections have been recorded , but as the UK is not testing widely , true infection numbers are likely to be much higher . 
How is the UK handling the outbreak ? 
The British government , criticized for its less aggressive start in responding to the pandemic , has been attempting new measures to flatten the curve of new Covid 19 infections after a high profile study found that coronavirus could overwhelm the number of intensive care beds and lead to 250,000 deaths in the UK . 
Officials infected : The UK 's response to the coronavirus pandemic was upended on Friday when the Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his top health minister tested positive for the infection , and his chief medical adviser self isolated after displaying symptoms .
