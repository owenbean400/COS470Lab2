Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham slammed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson after the northern English city was forced into the country 's strictest Tier 3 coronavirus restrictions , after local leaders and the central government failed to reach an agreement on an economic relief deal on Tuesday . 
Burnham said he requested £ 90 million ( $ 117 million ) in government support until the end of the financial year -- based on a £ 15 million per month costing -- but the government tabled £ 60 million . 
Burnham said he later agreed to £ 65 million but the government did not budge and walked away . 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a Downing Street news conference Tuesday that the government " made a generous and extensive offer to support Manchester ’s businesses " but " the Mayor did not accept this unfortunately . 
He said that Greater Manchester will receive £ 22 million of financial help , adding that not to enforce the new restrictions " would put Manchester ’s NHS [ National Health Service ] , and the lives of many of Manchester ’s residents , at risk . " 
UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the House of Commons that the £ 60 million offer was still on the table . 
The opposition Labour party will today force Parliament to vote for a fair deal for communities facing restrictions , according to its leader Keir Starmer . 
Under the new Tier 3 rules , Manchester will have to shut pubs and bars and there will be a ban on social mixing indoors and in private gardens -- although questions have been raised over how the region will comply following the stand off . 
Many in the UK -- including Starmer and scientists advising the government -- have called for a national " circuit breaker " lockdown , as seen in Wales and Ireland . 
But Johnson has resisted the calls so far , favoring a tiered , localized approach .
