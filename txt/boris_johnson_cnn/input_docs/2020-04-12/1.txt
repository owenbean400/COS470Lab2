United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he finds it hard to find the words to thank those who saved his life , saying " things could have gone either way " while he was in hospital . 
Johnson was discharged from hospital on Sunday after being treated for coronavirus , including three nights in intensive care . 
He said health care worker 's courage and devotion stood out . 
" I have seen the personal courage not just of the doctors and nurses but of everyone , the cleaners , the cooks , the health care workers of every description — physios , radiographers , pharmacists — who have kept coming to work , kept putting themselves in harm ’s way , kept risking this deadly virus , " Johnson said . 
Johnson used the message to personally name some of the health care workers who looked after him , including two nurses – one from New Zealand and one from Portugal – who stood by his bedside . 
Johnson will now spend some time recovering at the prime minister ’s countryside retreat .
