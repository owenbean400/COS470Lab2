The British public is staying home despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently easing lockdown restrictions , according to a new study by King 's College London . 
The study showed that one in seven adults surveyed did not leave their home once in the previous week and 41 % of people did not leave their home for five or more of the past seven days . 
These numbers show " the seriousness with which the public are still treating the Covid 19 crisis , " Duffy said . 
More people are also wearing face masks , according to the study which showed that the number of people wearing them has doubled from six weeks ago . " Compared with six weeks ago , compliance remains very high and virtually unchanged " for measures such as social distancing and hand washing , the study said . 
Some context : Prime Minister Johnson said on Thursday that Britain will begin lifting restrictions starting Monday in a phased approach . 
The relaxation comes after the death rate in the UK has fallen consistently . 
From a peak of 943 deaths on April 14 , the UK announced 256 coronavirus related deaths on Thursday -- a significant but diminishing toll .
