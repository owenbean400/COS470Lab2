A second national lockdown is a " possibility " in England which has reached a " rather precarious point " amid a sharp rise in coronavirus infections , a leading expert and government adviser said Sunday . 
Peter Horby – who advises the government on the threat posed by respiratory viruses — told the BBC that local hospitals in the worst affected areas in the north of England are beginning to feel the pressure of a possible second wave . 
" The numbers are not looking good at all , " Horby added . 
" We 've got an increase in cases , an increase in hospitalizations , " he said , adding that the UK is also starting to see the number of deaths increase . 
On a positive note , Horby said that – compared to the first wave of Covid 19 infections — the UK now has a " much better testing and tracing capabilities , we have a much better understanding of the disease , and what 's great to see is that it appears that the risk of death in hospitalized patients is coming down . " 
The comments by the Chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group ( NERVTAG ) came ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s expected announcement Monday of new coronavirus restrictions in England . 
Johnson plans to hold a telephone conference with cabinet members on Sunday as he prepares to bring in a new three tier coronavirus restrictions regime , the UK ’s PA Media reported .
