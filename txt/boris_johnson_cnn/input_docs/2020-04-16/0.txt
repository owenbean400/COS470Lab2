Britain â€™s Covid 19 lockdown measures have been extended for " at least " another three weeks , UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said . 
Speaking at a today 's government coronavirus press briefing , Raab , who is filling in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid 19 , said while there are " indications " the measures have been successful in slowing the spread of the virus , overall the infection rate has not dropped as much as needed . 
" It would undo the progress that we have made to date , and would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures , " Raab added .
