As the United Kingdom becomes the first Western national to approve a Covid 19 vaccine , Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is celebrating the scientific achievement , but warned the country not to get " carried away with optimism . " 
He said the first doses will go to health and care staff , elderly people and those who are " clinically extremely vulnerable , " but adding that it wo not come without challenges . 
" There are immense logistical challenges . 
The virus has got to be stored at minus 70 degrees , each person needs two injections , three weeks apart . 
So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected , " Johnson said . 
Some background : UK regulators granted emergency authorization for a vaccine made by US pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner Bio NTech on Tuesday . 
A final analysis of the Phase 3 trial of the vaccine shows it was 95 % effective in preventing infections , even in older adults , and caused no serious safety concerns , Pfizer said last month . 
The announcement means the UK has vaulted past the United States and European Union in the race to approve a vaccine , months into a pandemic that has killed almost 1.5 million people worldwide .
