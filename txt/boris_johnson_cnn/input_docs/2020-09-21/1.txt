The number of coronavirus cases in the UK is doubling roughly every seven days , according to the country 's chief scientific advisor , Patrick Vallance . 
If that rate continues to grow unabated , " by mid October you would end up with something like 50,000 per day , " which " could lead to 200 deaths a day " by November , Vallance warned at a Monday press briefing . 
" If we do not act , the virus will take off , " Vallance 's colleague Chris Whitty , the UK 's chief medical officer , told the same briefing in Downing Street . 
" That is the path we are on and if we do not change course , we will find ourselves in a difficult problem . " 
The advisors ' comments have fueled speculation that the government is preparing the ground for a second national lockdown , or other hard measures , in order to get cases back to a sustainable level . 
" In ... the next six months , I think we have to realize that we have to take this collectively very seriously , " Whitty said , adding that the country had turned a corner " in a bad sense . " 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to make a statement to the country later this week .
