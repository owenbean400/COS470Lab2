UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that keeping schools closed across the country is " socially intolerable , economically unsustainable and morally indefensible . " 
He added there is a " moral duty " to reopen schools next month for all students despite the continued threat from the coronavirus . 
Writing for the Mail on Sunday newspaper , Johnson said it was " crucial " for children 's welfare , health and future that they return to the classroom full time . 
" We can do it -- and we will do it . 
Social justice demands it . " 
Most UK schoolchildren have been at home since the government imposed coronavirus lockdown measures in March . 
Johnson said time spent out of the classroom could lead to lower educational attainment and have a lasting impact on children 's future life chances . 
" Most painfully of all , the costs of school closure have fallen disproportionately on the most disadvantaged , the very children who need school the most , " he wrote . 
Teachers ' unions have voiced concerns over the safety of staff and students when schools reopen .
