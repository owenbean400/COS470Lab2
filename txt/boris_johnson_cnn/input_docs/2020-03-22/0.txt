UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the country 's NHS risks becoming " overwhelmed " by the coronavirus outbreak and that the situation in Britain is just two or three weeks behind Italy . 
" The numbers are very stark , and they are accelerating . 
We are only a matter of weeks -- two or three -- behind Italy , " Johnson said . 
" The Italians have a superb health care system . 
And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand . 
The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing . 
" That is why this country has taken the steps that it has , in imposing restrictions never seen before either in peace or war . " 
Johnson ’s statement was released on Mother ’s Day in the UK . 
He is urging people to stay away from their mothers because of the virus – and instead ring them or video call them . 
Just a few days ago , however , Johnson himself said he hoped to see his own mother .
