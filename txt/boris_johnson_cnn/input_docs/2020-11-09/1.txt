UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that he thinks the anti vaccination argument " holds no water . " 
It came after Johnson confirmed that the UK had 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and was " ready to start using it " once it was approved . 
The drugmaker said Monday that early data showed its vaccine was more than 90 % effective -- a much better than expected level of efficacy , if the trend continues . 
Johnson also announced that more than half a million rapid Covid 19 tests would be rolled out across England this week , in the next phase of his government â€™s plan to expand asymptomatic testing . 
The 600,000 lateral flow tests sent by the National Health Service ( NHS ) Test and Trace to local public health leaders this week will enable increased testing of priority and high risk groups in local communities , according to a UK government press release . 
They will be followed by weekly local allocations .
