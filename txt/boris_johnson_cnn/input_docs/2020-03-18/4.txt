Schools across the UK will close from Friday , Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced Wednesday . 
They are expected to shut at the end of the school day on Friday , and remain closed until further notice . 
The closures will affect students of all ages , except for the children of key workers -- including NHS staff , police and delivery drivers – and vulnerable children . 
" We therefore need schools to make provisions for the children of these key workers … and they also need to look after the most vulnerable children , " Johnson said during his daily coronavirus press conference . 
" For many parents , these steps will be frustrating , " Johnson conceded . 
" That ’s why we are now working on further measures … to keep our economy going . "
