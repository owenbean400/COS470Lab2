A top adviser to the UK government in the country 's coronavirus response believes he has caught the disease , confirming he had been in meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior officials before developing symptoms . 
Neil Ferguson is head of the modelling program at Imperial College London 's center for global infectious disease analysis , and it was his team 's research that prompted the UK government to impose more restrictive measures to slow the virus ' spread . 
Ferguson announced his possible infection on Twitter , and told the BBC 's Radio 4 program that just days before he had been in touch with the Prime Minister and the country 's chief medical officer , Chris Whitty , and chief scientific adviser , Sir Patrick Vallance . 
" I ’ve been in so many meetings in the last few weeks and a number of my colleagues from other universities who ’ve been advising government in those meetings have also developed symptoms , " he told the BBC . 
He said he had not had contact with anyone in the 12 hours prior to the onset of his symptoms , so it is possible he was not infectious at the time of his meetings with officials . 
He added that he was not surprised to have developed coronavirus symptoms , adding that central London was a hotspot .
