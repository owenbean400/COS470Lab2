UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will on Monday set out the government ’s plan for England to exit its second national lockdown on December 2 , outlining what is expected to be a " strengthened " tier system for the country , Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said Sunday . 
" The Prime Minister will be setting out more details tomorrow about the next steps and our fight against coronavirus , " Sunak told Sky News . 
" The good news is , we will be exiting national restrictions on the 2nd of December , as the Prime Minister said at the beginning of the month long restrictions , " he added . 
According to the Chancellor , the Prime Minister is expected to chair a cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon to " discuss the details for re entering the tier system " in England . 
While the Chancellor declined to comment on whether a 10 p.m . curfew on the hospitality sector would be extended , a government source said Sunday that the curfew would be extended by one hour to 11 p.m . as part of the government ’s plan to exit the nationwide lockdown . 
On Monday , the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( SAGE ) is also expected to publish documents showing that previous tier restrictions were ineffective , the source added . 
It comes just a week after Public Health England ’s Dr . Susan Hopkins said the government would need to consider " strengthening " the tier system until an effective vaccine becomes widely available in the UK . 
" We have recognized that the tiering of the country has had a different effect in each area , " the UK medical adviser said Monday . 
" We see very little effect from Tier 1 and I think when we look at what tiers may be there in the future , we will have to think about strengthening them in order to get us through the winter months , " she added .
