A draft UK government plan to ease anti coronavirus restrictions includes reducing hot desking and strategies to minimize contagion where social distancing is not possible , British media reported on Monday . 
Additional health and safety procedures , physical screens and the use of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) should be considered in environments where maintaining a safe social distance of 2m ( 6ft ) between employees is not possible , according to British outlets who say they have seen a leaked version of the plan . 
The government will urge employers to minimize the number of staff using equipment , stagger shift times and continue to encourage working from home , the reports said . 
A complete version of the plan is expected to be revealed by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson next Sunday , as part of the government â€™s " roadmap " of the way out of lockdown . 
The UK 's lockdown measures are due to be reviewed again by May 7 . 
On his return to work last Monday , Johnson warned that the UK was at " the moment of maximum risk " and suggested restrictions would need to remain in place for the time being , in order to avoid a second peak of infection .
