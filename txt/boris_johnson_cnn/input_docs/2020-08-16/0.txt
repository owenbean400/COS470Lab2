Schools or pubs ? 
That 's the choice some believe UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face when English students return to their classrooms next month . 
On the surface , it might seem a straightforward case of weighing up which is more important : a quick recovery from the economic downturn caused by lockdown , or students avoiding the " generational catastrophe " that the UN Secretary General predicted if schools are not reopened . 
But this is not how the government sees it . 
According to numerous UK government sources who were not permitted to speak about policy yet to be announced , here 's where Downing Street is currently : First , the calculation has changed now that we have seen exactly how damaging the lockdown has been to the UK 's economy . 
On Wednesday , it was revealed that the UK 's GDP had fallen a record 20.4 % in the second quarter of 2020 . 
Second , this is not a zero sum game , one government adviser told CNN . 
" It 's not the case of if pubs and bars are open X will happen and if you open schools Y will happen . 
If everyone is compliant with the rules of social distancing , cleaning their hands , you can basically have both at once . " 
Third , the two things are not unrelated . 
" Schools are going back regardless , mostly because parents need to get back to work . 
Everything has a knock on effect , " said a senior civil servant . 
Fourth , there is still no clear idea of when a vaccine will arrive , and certain groups are still at higher risk . 
So if most people can go back to some type of normality , the focus can be on local lockdowns and protecting the vulnerable . 
In short , the government might try to do everything at once -- even though public health experts fear the country is still not in a position to guarantee doing any of this safely .
