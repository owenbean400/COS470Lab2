The UK car market suffered its worst month in more than seven decades in April as coronavirus restrictions forced dealerships to close , pushing sales of new vehicles down by more than 97 % . 
Just over 4,320 cars were sold to private buyers , businesses and fleets last month in Britain , according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders , compared with roughly 161,000 in April 2019 . 
The industry association described the sales decline as " the steepest of modern times . " 
With showrooms closed and potential buyers sheltering at home , the industry group said that only 871 cars were sold to private buyers during the month . 
Many of those were battery electric vehicles such as Tesla 's Model 3 that customers had on order . 
The monthly sales total is the weakest since February 1946 , when 4,044 cars were sold in Britain as the country struggled to regain its footing in the immediate aftermath of World War II . 
The UK has been under lockdown since late March , when Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered pubs , restaurants , theaters , cinemas and gyms to close as part of an effort to contain the coronavirus pandemic .
