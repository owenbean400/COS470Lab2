UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson â€™s cabinet met entirely via videoconference for the first time on Tuesday , due to the spread of coronavirus among government officials . 
" Ministers all appeared on a single digital screen , in a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister , " said 10 Downing Street in a statement . 
Only the cabinet secretary and a small number of officials attended the meeting in person , " observing social distancing rules on keeping two metres apart , " added the statement . 
The meeting focused on the Covid 19 situation around the UK . 
Judging by the rising number of deaths , the Prime Minister emphasized the need for people to say at home and practice social distancing . 
" The situation is going to get worse before it gets better -- but it will get better , " he said in the statement . 
Johnson and health secretary Matt Hancock were diagnosed with the virus last Friday .
