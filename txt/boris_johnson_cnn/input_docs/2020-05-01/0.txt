The UK transmission rate has fallen below one â€” which means that the number of new infections in the community is falling , National Medical Director of NHS England Stephen Powis said on Friday . 
He added that the number of people in hospitals with coronavirus has been falling since mid April , and that the number of people in critical care beds was also declining . 
A word of caution : In his first remarks after returning to work Monday , UK Prime minister Boris Johnson warned that the country was at " the moment of maximum risk " and suggested restrictions would need to remain in place for the time being in to avoid a second peak of infection . 
The UK 's lockdown measures are due to be reviewed again by May 7 .
