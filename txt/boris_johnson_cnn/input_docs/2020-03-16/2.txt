The UK government is now advising people to stay at home for 14 days instead of seven days if they – or anyone in their household — has coronavirus symptoms : a new persistent cough or fever . 
" If one person in the household has symptoms , the whole household should stay at home , " the UK ’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said . 
He reassured the nation that " the chances of dying from coronavirus is very low " and that " some people will get it and will have no symptoms at all . " 
" For those that do have symptoms the majority will be mild and be able to managed at home , " Whitty said . 
Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said they are focused on delaying the spread of coronavirus in the community and keeping people safe . 
He said people in the most vulnerable groups should follow social distancing measures for " 12 weeks or so . " 
The officials comments came at a news conference alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson who acknowledged people would question why such " draconian " measures had not been introduced sooner but he said they were part of a gradual plan .
