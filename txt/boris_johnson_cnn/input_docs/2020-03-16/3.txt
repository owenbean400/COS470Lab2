The UK government will not enforce its new social distancing coronavirus measures with fines or legal threats because the UK is " a mature and grown up democracy where people understand the advice being given to them , " UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said . 
He explained : " Do not forget that other countries are in different stages in their movement up the curve . 
The crucial things is timeliness . 
Our interventions should be timely to have the maximum effect … when you come to more extreme measures like curfews and things we ’ve seen in other countries , we ’re keeping all things under review … we ’re keeping school closures under review . " 
The UK is not currently testing everyone with coronavirus symptoms , a strategy that has been questioned by experts . 
The UK ’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said they would " continue to scale up testing , but I think it ’s important to realize the scale for testing which has been substantial , and we will continue to scale up from here . " 
He said " the next level out " will be for healthcare workers and other critical workers with symptoms to be tested . 
" People should be thinking of a minimum of weeks to months , people should realize we are in this for the long haul , " Whitty said , in regards to how long the new social distancing measures might last .
