UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government is likely to become increasingly insistent that people wear face masks in confined spaces . 
" I do think we do need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people that they normally meet , " Johnson said during an online question and answer session with members of the public . 
Johnson said the " balance of scientific opinion " is in favor of wearing face masks , but added that he wants to return to a situation where people feel able to shake hands again .
