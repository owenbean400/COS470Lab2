The British government has announced that health workers and care staff from non European Economic Area ( EEA ) countries will no longer have to pay a contentious fee for their medical care . 
The Immigration Health Surcharge is a fee paid by most non EEA nationals applying for temporary leave to remain in Britain . 
The government has said the surcharge exists to " ensure that migrants make a proper financial contribution to the cost of their [ National Health Service ( NHS ) ] care . " 
UK Home Secretary Priti Patel said the charge would be scrapped for NHS workers and care staff , in a tweet posted on Thursday . 
The government 's abrupt shift on the policy came after opposition leader Keir Starmer urged UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to scrap the charge for non EEA workers , during an exchange in parliament on Wednesday . 
Johnson initially defended the fee during the session , saying the surcharge was " the right way forward . " 
" I challenged the prime minister about this yesterday , at Prime Minister 's Questions [ and ] asked him to reconsider , " Starmer said on Thursday , in a video posted to Twitter . 
" He 's now done a u turn . 
That 's a good thing , a victory for common decency . " 
The British government has also extended its bereavement scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers . 
The scheme allows the bereaved non EEA family members of NHS staff , who died as a result of coronavirus , to obtain immediate indefinite leave to stay in the UK .
