India will be given first priority for the delivery of the Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine after its British developers claimed success following mass testing , the world ’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume has said . 
The chief executive of the Serum Institute of India , Adar Poonawalla , said the manufacturer has already produced 40m doses of the vaccine so far . 
Poonawalla , whose father founded the vaccine manufacturer , told television broadcaster NDTV they should have 100m doses by January . 
He said he expected some 90 % of Serum Institute ’s doses were to be sold to the Indian government at around 250 rupees ( $ 3 ) , while the rest would be sold to the private markets for the higher price of 1,000 rupees . 
With an emergency use licence , they hoped to start rolling the vaccine out in December or January , Poonawalla added . 
Astra Zeneca and Oxford University said their drug has up to 90 % efficacy and can be transported easily at normal refrigerator temperatures - unlike some of the other candidates , which require extremely cold storage . 
Astra Zeneca said it planned to produce up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 if it passes the remaining regulatory hurdles . 
Indian health minister Harsh Vardhan told India Today TV he expected 250-300 million Indians would be immunised by September next year . 
First would be health workers , other frontline workers including the police , paramilitary and those working in sanitisation , as well as people aged above 65 , Vardhan added . 
Prime minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet state leaders on Tuesday for discussions about the distribution of the vaccine , local media reported . 
India is the second worst infected nation after the US , with more than 9.1 million virus cases .
