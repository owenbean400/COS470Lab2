One of the Britain â€™s most senior scientists has criticised the government for the " shroud of secrecy " drawn over major decisions in the coronavirus crisis and urged ministers to be more open about the reasons behind their policies . 
Sir Paul Nurse , the nobel laureate and director of the Francis Crick Institute in London , said important decisions throughout the pandemic had been made in what appeared to be a " black box " of scientists , civil servants and politicians , and called for more transparency and scrutiny . 
The failure to be more open about pivotal decisions , and the basis on which they were reached , meant it had been impossible to challenge emerging policy , he said , a situation that fuelled poor decisions and put public trust at risk .
