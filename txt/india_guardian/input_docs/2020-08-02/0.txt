Kosovo prime minister Avdullah Hoti said on Sunday he has contracted Covid 19 and will self isolate at home for two weeks , Reuters reports . 
" I do not have symptoms expect a very mild cough , " Hoti said on his Facebook page . 
Hoti â€™s government has faced criticism for not doing enough to curb the spread of coronavirus , with the small Balkan country reporting a sharp increase in cases in the past few days - including 13 deaths on Sunday . 
Around 9,000 people have been infected with Covid 19 and 249 have died since mid March , when the first cases with the virus were reported in Kosovo .
