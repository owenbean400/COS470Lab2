Cyprus will introduce compulsory testing for all arrivals from Greece from 6 August , health authorities said on Sunday , after a spike in coronavirus infections in Greece over the past week . 
The health ministry said any travellers from Greece would be required to show a negative PCR test conducted within 72 hours of travel to Cyprus . 
Cypriots and permanent residents of Cyprus could opt for a test at airports upon their arrival . 
The eastern Mediterranean island is thought to be one of the first countries to introduce the tests on arrivals from Greece since the lockdown eased . 
Greece still displays significantly lower infection rates than other European countries . 
The move comes at the height of the holiday season . 
Greece is a popular holiday destination for thousands of Cypriots . 
Both countries kept a lid on a first wave of infections by imposing blanket lockdowns from mid March to May , but rates have been creeping up after a lull from late May to late July . 
On Saturday Greece reported its highest single day spike in weeks , of 110 new cases , while Cyprus reported 25 new cases on Friday , the first time it has been in double digits in weeks . 
Cyprus has a three tier risk system in grouping countries where travel is either unrestricted , allowed with a PCR test , or permitted with a PCR test and compulsory 14 day quarantine . 
Greece has now moved to the ‘ B ’ category from the ‘ A ’ category . 
The list is regularly updated .
