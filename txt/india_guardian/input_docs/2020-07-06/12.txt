Egypt has reported 969 new cases the health ministry has said , the first drop below 1,000 registered daily since 27 May . 
In total , 76,222 cases and 3,422 deaths have been reported , including 79 deaths on Monday , the ministry said . 
Egypt reopened resorts to foreign tourists last week after tourism came to halt in March under measures to curb the epidemic . 
But Egypt was not on an initial " safe list " of 14 countries for resumption of non essential travel to the EU , announced last week . 
Tourism accounts for 5 % of Egypt â€™s economic output , according to the government . 
But analysts put the figure as much as 15 % if jobs indirectly related to the sector are included .
