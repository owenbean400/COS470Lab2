Puerto Rico ’s government reported a new daily high in Covid 19 cases on Monday , but critics said the numbers were deeply flawed . 
The health department reported 530 new coronavirus cases , topping a spurt of 485 on 4 June . 
But the numbers include both molecular swab tests for current infections and serological tests for antibodies , and independent health experts complained that some of the results date back as far as April , so they do not provide an accurate picture of the current situation . 
" We keep watching the virus through a rearview mirror " , Puerto Rico epidemiologist Roberta Lugo told the Associated Press , adding that the government keeps taking decisions based on faulty and incomplete data . 
The US territory of about 3.2 million people has reported 8,585 confirmed or probable cases of Covid 19 and at least 155 deaths . 
A spokeswoman for Puerto Rico health secretary Lorenzo González said he was not immediately available . 
The secretary told WAPA TV on Monday that while the government has seen a progressive increase in cases , there is currently no strain on health resources . 
He said 115 patients are hospitalised , with 18 of those in the intensive care unit and another 11 on ventilators . 
González said he might recommend rolling back recent re openings if the increase in cases continues . 
Puerto Rico was one of the first US juristictions to impose tight restrictions to fight the disease and it is lifting those in stages . 
Governor Wanda Vázquez last week announced strict new rules for anyone flying into Puerto Rico , including a mandatory Covid 19 molecular test within 72 hours before travelling .
