Ireland will judge whether to ease quarantine restrictions on people travelling from abroad from 20 July on the amount of new cases , the trend and the quality of testing and tracing in qualifying countries , the country ’s government has said . 
Ireland , which has been more cautious than much of Europe on the reopening of its economy and air travel , has advised its citizens against non essential travel since March and requires anyone arriving in the country to self isolate for 14 days . 
The outgoing government had promised to produce by a " green list " of exempt countries with similar or lower risk to Ireland by 9 July but the new administration delayed that date amid increased warnings from public health officials . 
The taoiseach Micheál Martin said : We know we are still dealing with a very internationally volatile situation , as witnessed in Spain , as witnessed in the UK and that is informing our view as second waves are emerging . 
On 20 July , we ’ll be in a position to say whether any country or whether a number of countries make the green list ... 
At the moment , there would be a number of countries in that position but that can change .
