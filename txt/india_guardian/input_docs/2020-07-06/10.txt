The New Zealand government and Air New Zealand have agreed to " manage " incoming international flights together , as the country struggles with huge numbers of Kiwis returning home , and requiring two weeks of quarantine at the government ’s expense . 
This week , more than 3,000 Kiwis are booked to return home , and management and consistency problems have plagued quarantine hotels , including returnees being allowed to leave isolation early , and hundreds released without taking a test – meaning they then had to be tracked down in the community . 
Air New Zealand has agreed to put a temporary hold on new bookings in the short term , as well as to look at aligning daily arrivals with the capacity available at managed isolation facilities , " said Megan Woods , a government minister . 
People who have already booked flights with Air New Zealand will still be able to enter New Zealand subject to availability of quarantine space . 
Woods added that the government was also in talks with other airlines about managing their flows .
