The US saw a 27 % increase in new cases in the week to 5 July , compared to the previous seven days , with 24 states reporting positivity test rates above the level that the World Health Organization has flagged as concerning . 
Nationally , 7.5 % of diagnostic tests came back positive last week , up from 7 % the prior week and 5 % two weeks ago , according to a Reuters analysis of data from The Covid Tracking Project , a volunteer run effort to track the outbreak . 
The WHO considers a positivity rate above 5 % to be a cause for concern because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered , Reuters has reported . 
Deaths , which health experts say are a lagging indicator , continued to fall nationally to 3,447 people in the week ended 5 July . 
A handful of states , however , have reported increases in deaths for at least two straight weeks , including Alabama , Florida , South Carolina , Texas and Tennessee .
