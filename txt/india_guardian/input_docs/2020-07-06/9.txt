In the UK , care leaders , unions and MPs have rounded on Boris Johnson after he accused care homes of failing to follow proper procedures amid the pandemic , saying the prime minister appeared to be shifting the blame for the high death toll , Peter Walker , Kate Proctor and Rajeev Syal write . 
With nearly 20,000 care home residents confirmed to have died with Covid 19 , and estimates that the true toll is much greater , there has been widespread criticism about a lack of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , testing and clear guidelines for the sector . 
On Monday , the total UK â€™s death toll rose to 44,236 , up 16 on the day before . 
The Guardian has previously revealed how public health officials proposed a radical lockdown of care homes at the height of the pandemic , but they were rejected by the government . 
Agency staff were found to have spread the virus between homes . 
But a health department plan published in April mentioned nothing about restricting staff movements . 
Around 25,000 patients were discharged into care homes without being tested , an official report said .
