The health ministry of Cyprus has advised doctors to curtail the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on some COVID 19 patients amid renewed concerns that the drugs could trigger heart problems and put lives at risk . 
This is after Cypriot health authorities bought enough of the drugs to treat a quarter of its population if they became infected in the early days of the pandemic . 
The ministry urged doctors on Thursday to be particularly vigilant and to even stop administering the two substances to COVID 19 patients with pre existing heart conditions . 
The ministry said an advisory body of medical experts is re evaluating the use of the drugs and may revise its directives . 
The announcement came after the World Health Organization said it would temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its global study into experimental COVID 19 treatments . 
A paper published last week in the Lancet showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those that were not . 
Cyprus health minister said last month that the country was among the first nations to approve use of the anti malaria drug to treat COVID 19 patients . 
Cypriot authorities procured enough chloroquine to treat as many as 240,000 people roughly a quarter of the island nations population if they became infected . 
It was part of a five ton consignment of the drug that Cyprus and Israel jointly purchased from India .
