Argentina ’s coronavirus infections were poised to top 700,000 on Saturday as new daily infections and deaths hit the top five globally , Reuters data showed , despite seven months of lockdown that have ravaged the frail economy . 
Argentina reported a rolling seven day average of 11,082 new cases daily , behind only India , the United States , France and Brazil , all countries with far larger populations than the South American nation . 
Argentina ’s average daily death toll this week hit 365 . 
Health officials on Friday reported 691,235 total infections since March and 15,208 deaths . 
Earlier in the day , the province of Buenos Aires announced it had underestimated the death toll from Covid 19 by 3,523 , outraging many Argentines already weary from months of lockdown that had failed to slam the breaks on the pandemic . 
The additional deaths from Buenos Aires province were not incorporated in those figures , the health ministry said . 
Argentina , which was already in the grip of a devastating economic crisis , was among the first countries in Latin America to implement a strict lockdown . 
But a gradual loosening over time and the spread of cases from the capital to the provinces have seen cases skyrocket . 
Carlos Landa , a 45 year old archaeologist from Buenos Aires who contracted the virus said he and his partner , who was also infected , had seen their lives turned upside down . 
Different health care coverage meant one was immediately tested , and the other was not . 
The virus had exposed once again the perils of the ailing economy and health care systems , he told Reuters , saying : Everything is uncertain .
