Coronavirus infection rates among adults in India have risen sharply , a new survey has shown , although cases could rise much further because a large percentage of the population has not yet been exposed . 
In the serological survey conducted in August and September , blood samples were tested for SARS Co V 2 antibodies . 
If a person tests positive for the antibodies , it means they were infected with the virus at some point . 
Blood samples collected from more than 29,000 adults between 17 August and 22 September showed that the prevalence of SARS Co V 2 antibodies increased to 7.1 % compared to 0.73 % in a previous survey between 11 May and 4 June , the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research , Balram Bhargava , told a press briefing . 
" However , a large percentage of the population is still unexposed and the susceptibility of a considerable section of people getting infected exists , " he added .
