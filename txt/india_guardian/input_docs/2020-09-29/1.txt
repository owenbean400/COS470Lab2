The AFP news agency has more on the Indian study mentioned below . 
Its key finding is pretty stark : more than 60 million people in India - 10 times the official figure - could have contracted the novel coronavirus , the country ’s lead pandemic agency has said , citing a nationwide study measuring antibodies . 
According to official data , India is the world ’s second most infected nation , with more than 6.1 million cases , just behind the United States .

" The main conclusions from this sero survey are that one in 15 individuals aged more than 10 have been exposed to SARS Co V 2 by August , " Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) director general Balram Bhargava said at a health ministry press conference .
