Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday , the federal civil aviation minister has said , despite a 24 hour record increase in new cases on Sunday . 
The announcement follows a day of " hard negotiations " , the minister said , after some states sought to limit the number of flights . 
Flights will restart under an easing of restrictions , despite the 6,767 new cases that brought India ’s total to over 131,000 . 
Airlines are preparing to resume about a third of their domestic flight operations from Monday , even without clarity over what quarantine rules may apply to passengers . 
The western state of Maharashtra , Tamil Nadu in the south and West Bengal in the east - business hubs and home to India ’s busiest airports - had said they were not prepared to open for flights as coronavirus cases rose , state government officials said . 
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu agreed to operate limited flights from Monday , while southern state of Andhra Pradesh would allow flights from Tuesday , India ’s civil aviation minister , Hardeep Singh Puri , said on Twitter . 
" It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state government to recommence civil aviation operations in the country ... 
Domestic flights will recommence across the country from tomorrow , " he said . 
It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state govts to recommence civil aviation operations in the country . 
Except Andhra Pradesh which will start on 26/5 & amp ; 
West Bengal on 28/5 , domestic flights will recommence across the country from tomorrow . 
West Bengal urged the central government to postpone the resumption of passenger flights to Kolkata as it focuses on rescue work after Cyclone Amphan hit the city .

India ’s federal structure gives its 28 states flexibility to set their own rules , complicating government efforts to kickstart the economy .
