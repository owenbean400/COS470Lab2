Astra Zeneca ’s Covid 19 vaccine trial in the US is expected to resume as early as this week after the US food and drug administration ( FDA ) completed its review of a serious illness , sources told Reuters . 
Astra Zeneca ’s large , late stage US trial has been on hold since 6 September , after a participant in the company ’s UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis . 
The sources , who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous , said they have been told the trial could resume later this week . 
It was unclear how the FDA would characterise the illness , they said . 
The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants , according to one of the sources . 
UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was " insufficient evidence to say for certain " that it was or was not related to the vaccine . 
It permitted the trial to resume enrolling participants in the UK , according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters . 
Regulators in Brazil , India and South Africa also previously allowed Astra Zeneca to resume its vaccine trials there . 
Astra Zeneca , which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers , had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for Covid 19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness . 
Early data from large scale trials in the US of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are expected some time next month . 
An Astra Zeneca spokeswoman said : " We cannot comment on a pending FDA decision . "
