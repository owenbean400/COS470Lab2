Former Maldives president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said he has tested positive for coronavirus as the island nation battles an increase in new cases . 
Gayoom , who held power for three decades , was checked after he developed a fever , a former aide close to the family told AFP . 
No word was available on his condition . 
" I have tested positive for Covid 19 , " the 82 year old politician wrote on Twitter . 
" May Almighty Allah bless me and all other sick people with a speedy recovery and good health ! " 
After leaving office in 2008 Gayoom has remained an active political figure . 
Opponents have accused him of being an autocratic leader during his three decades in power . 
However , he is also credited with being an early campaigner against global warming and sea level rise which he had warned could wipe the low lying Maldives off the face of the earth . 
The Maldives , known for upmarket island tourism , reopened its international borders to visitors in mid July after a three month halt that crippled the hospitality industry . 
It has seen a steady increase in cases in recent weeks and has reported a total of 7,047 infections and 28 deaths .
