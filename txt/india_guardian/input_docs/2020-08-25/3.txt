The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling , a development experts credit at least partly to increased wearing of masks , even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day . 
About 43,000 new cases are being reported daily across the country , down 21 % from early August , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . 
While the US , India and Brazil still have the highest numbers of new cases in the world , the downward trend is encouraging . 
" It ’s profoundly hopeful news , " said Dr Monica Gandhi , an infectious diseases expert at the University of California who credits the American public ’s growing understanding of how the virus spreads , more mask wearing and , possibly , an increasing level of immunity . 
" Hopefully all those factors are coming into play to get this virus under control in this country that ’s really been battered by the pandemic , " she said . 
The virus is blamed for more than 5.7 million confirmed infections and about 178,000 deaths in the US . 
The decline in newly reported cases in the US comes even as deaths from the virus remain alarmingly high . 
Over the past two weeks , officials have reported an average of 965 deaths a day from Covid 19 , down from 1,051 a day in early August . 
The percentage of tests coming back positive for the disease has also declined over the past two weeks , from 7.3 % to 6.1 % . 
But that comes as the total number of tests administered has fallen from its August peak of more than 820,000 a day , levelling off in recent weeks at about 690,000 a day . 
The situation has improved dramatically in several states that struggled with high caseloads earlier this summer . 
In Arizona , for example , officials reported 859 new cases on Tuesday , down from a peak of 5,500 in late June . 
More than 2,000 people arrived at the state ’s hospitals showing symptoms of the virus on a single day in early July . 
This week , that number has been less than 1,000 . 
In Florida , where more than 10,000 people have died , the state reported 2,600 new cases on Tuesday . 
Earlier in the summer , it was regularly reporting more than 10,000 .
