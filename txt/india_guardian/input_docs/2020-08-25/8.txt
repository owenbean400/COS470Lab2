Carnival ’s Princess Cruises has said it will cancel early 2021 cruises on two ships , citing travel , border and port restrictions due to the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Cruise lines , hammered by a crisis that has seen some ships turn into infection hotspots , had earlier said they were expecting solid 2021 bookings , mainly as repeat cruisers were eager to book their trips . 
Carnival ’s two ships affected , Island Princess and Pacific Princess , were set to sail from North America and Australia respectively . 
Guests that had booked trips on these ships would receive a refundable credit for future trips for the fare they paid , and an additional non refundable future cruise credit equal to 25 % of the fare paid , the company said . 
Earlier in the day , Carnival ’s Cunard also paused operations from November to up to 16 May 2021 . 
At least three Princess Cruises ships turned into hotbeds for coronavirus infections . 
One of them , the Ruby Princess , became part of a homicide investigation in Australia , being the source of the country ’s deadliest virus infection .
