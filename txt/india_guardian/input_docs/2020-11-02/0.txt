Argentina is expecting 10 million doses of Russia ’s main experimental COVID 19 vaccine between December and January , the government said , as infections continue to climb in the South American country . 
The vaccine , known as Sputnik V , is given in two doses and could begin arriving as early as next month , the government said in a news release . 
The price of the Russian vaccine would be " more or less average " compared with others , President Alberto Fernandez said in the release . 
" We had a proposal from the Russian foreign ministry and the Russian ( Direct Investment ) Fund to see if Argentina was interested in having doses of the vaccine in the month of December and of course we said yes , " Fernandez said . 
The Russian Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) is backing the development and roll out of the Sputnik V vaccine . 
Fernandez said talks with RDIF had been going on " for quite some time . " 
Officials including Argentina ’s deputy health minister had traveled to Russia to review the vaccine ’s development , the government said . 
" The Sputnik V vaccine for Argentina will be produced by RDIF partners in India , Korea , China and a number of other countries that are setting up a production of the Russian vaccine , " RDIF ’s CEO , Kirill Dmitriev , said in comments shared by a company spokesman .
