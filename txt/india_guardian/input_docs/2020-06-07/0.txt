Gym owners and trainers in several Indian cities held protests over the weekend demanding the re opening of fitness centres as many other lockdown restrictions are set to ease . 
As of Monday , shopping malls , restaurants , hotels and places of worship will be allowed to re open , over 10 weeks after a nationwide shutdown was imposed in late March . 
Gyms , however , will remain shut . 
The lockdown ’s relaxation comes as India records a rising number of new daily virus cases . 
The South Asian country has reported almost 250,000 cases so far including nearly 7,000 deaths . 
" We are running in losses for last three months and there is no clarity when the government plans to open the gyms , " Amritsar Gym Owners Association ’s president , Dharminder Verma , told AFP on Sunday . 
Gym owners were still paying rent and staff salaries despite being shut , Verma said . 
Similar protests were held in neighbouring Ludhiana district on Saturday , where topless bodybuilders did push ups and flexed their pumped up muscles .
