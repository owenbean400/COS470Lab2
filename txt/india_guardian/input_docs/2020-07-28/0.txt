Over half the people living in the slums of Mumbai have had Covid 19 , according to a city commissioned study released on Tuesday that raises fresh doubts about India ’s official case numbers . 
India is already the third worst hit country after the US and Brazil , with nearly 1.5 million cases , though experts have previously said the lack of testing could mean the true tally is much higher . 
Blood tests on 6,936 randomly selected people conducted by Mumbai ’s city authorities found that 57 % of slum dwellers and 16 % of non slum residents had virus antibodies . 
Mumbai , where about 40 % of the population lives in slums , has reported just over 110,000 infections and more than 6,000 deaths so far . 
The western city of 20 million people is home to India ’s largest slum , Dharavi , where an estimated one million people live . 
But deaths in the sprawling slum have not exploded , with local officials saying their aggressive efforts to stem the spread of the virus have been effective . 
The survey results suggested asymptomatic infections were " likely to be a high proportion of all infections " and also indicated the virus death rate was likely to be " very low " , the study said . 
The Mumbai survey came a week after an antibody study commissioned by the government suggested that almost a quarter of people in the capital New Delhi , home to 20 million people , have had the virus .
