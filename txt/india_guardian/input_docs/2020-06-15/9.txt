A group of 21 travellers arrested on suspicion of violating Hawaii ’s coronavirus quarantine order have agreed to leave the state because of threats from residents , a member of the group said Monday . 
The group , known as Carbon Nation , which one of the members , Kendra Carter , described as a nature loving family , were so excited to experience Hawaii that they decided to stop at the beach before going to their Big Island rental home , she said , according to the Associated Press . 
Hawaii ’s mandatory 14 day quarantine does not allow travellers to leave a residence or hotel room for any reason except medical emergencies . 
Carter said some of the harassment involved death threats . 
" People started rolling up to our house calling us all types of names , " she said . 
" Telling us to starve and a whole bunch of stuff . 
We ’ve been getting death threats in our inboxes . " 
Carter said the group did not realise that the quarantine on all people arriving in the state would be strictly enforced .
