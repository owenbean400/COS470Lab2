Hundreds of Cuban doctors and nurses who were sent to Mexico City to help respond to the pandemic could stay longer if cases keep rising , a senior government official said . 
In May , 585 healthcare workers from the island nation arrived in Mexico City , epicenter of the pandemic in Mexico . 
It marked one of the largest medical crews that Cuba , which dispatches doctors around the world , has sent to tackle the pandemic . 
Mexico City health minister Oliva Lopez said the Health Institute for Wellbeing ( Insabi ) is paying the Cuban health ministry 135 million pesos ( $ 6.03 million ) , Reuters reports . 
Biomedical engineers and epidemiologists have also been deployed , she said . 
Mexico City has almost 37,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus , about 25 per cent of the national total . 
Mexican health officials have said the country is short about 6,600 doctors and 23,000 nurses to properly respond to the pandemic . 
Despite having hired more than 2,000 doctors and nurses , Mexico City still does not have enough health personnel , Lopez said . 
Cuba has agreements with almost 70 countries to send doctors and other medical professionals . 
Few details about the deals are known , but under an agreement with Brazil that was in place through 2018 , the Cuban government kept 80 % of what it charged for each doctor , according to Brazilian health officials . 
United Nations officials said in November that the conditions under which Cuban doctors work could be considered " forced labor " , but Lopez defended the use of Cuban health care workers .
