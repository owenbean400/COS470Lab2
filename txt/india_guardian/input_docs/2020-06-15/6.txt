South Africa â€™s president Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday condemned a surge of femicides since his government eased anti coronavirus stay at home measures as " barbaric " and " acts of inhumanity " . 
Murders of women have spiralled since the start of June , when lockdown restrictions were loosened , allowing for more movement of people , according to the police . 
Speaking at a virtual African National Congress meeting , Ramaphosa said gender based violence " continues to plague our country and we have been saddened by the continuous and recurring news of men attacking and killing women in the past few weeks , " Agence France Presse reports . 
" Men continue to kill women in the most horrific and barbaric fashion , " he said , emphasising that " it must end " . 
In a weekly newsletter earlier , the president described the attacks as " acts of inhumanity " . 
The victim of one of the most gruesome attacks was an eight months pregnant woman whose stabbed body was found hanging from a tree in Roodepoort , a western suburb of Johannesburg . 
Five days later , the body of another young woman was found on Friday dumped under a tree in Soweto . 
Police have reported several other cases of femicide across the country in recent days . 
The reasons for the sudden increase are being investigated . 
Police minister Bheki Cele has said that an overall rise in crime was caused by the lifting of a ban on the sale of alcohol . 
On Saturday , Ramaphosa had referred to the past week as " a dark and shameful week for us as a nation " . 
" We note with disgust that at a time when the country is facing the gravest of threats from the pandemic , violent men are taking advantage of the eased restrictions on movement to attack women and children , " he said in a statement . 
In September 2019 , femicide was declared a national crisis .
