Death rates are 12 times higher for coronavirus patients with chronic illnesses than for others who become infected , a new US government report says . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Monday highlights the dangers posed by heart disease , diabetes and lung ailments , the top three health problems found in Covid 19 patients . 
The report is based on 1.3 million laboratory confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the agency from 22 January through the end of May . Information on health conditions was available for just 22 % of the patients . 
Of those , 32 % had a heart related disease , 30 % had diabetes and 18 % had chronic lung disease , which includes asthma and emphysema . 
Among patients with a chronic illness , about 20 % died compared with almost 2 % of those who were otherwise healthy . 
Virus patients with a chronic condition were also six times more likely to be hospitalised ( 46 % versus almost 8 % ) . 
People with chronic disease " are much more likely to suffer severe effects of Covid 19 , but we ca not lose sight of the fact that previously healthy people can also become very ill and even die as well , " Leana Wen , an emergency physician and public health specialist at George Washington University , said in a statement , according to the Associated Press . 
Race and ethnicity data , available for just under half of patients , show 36 % were white , 33 % Hispanic , 22 % black , 4 % Asian and about 1 % American Indian . 
Though the numbers are incomplete , they echo other reports that found minorities have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic . 
Among patients aged 80 and up who died , half had a chronic illness . 
Roughly equal numbers of men and women were infected , but men were more likely to have severe cases , the report found .
