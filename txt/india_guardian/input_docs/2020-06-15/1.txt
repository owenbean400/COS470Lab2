Resident doctors battling coronavirus in public hospitals in Nigeria went on strike on Monday to demand better benefits , including the provision of more protective equipment . 
Those treating Covid 19 patients will stay on the job but their union , the National Association of Resident Doctors ( NARD ) , gave the government two weeks to meet the demands or else they would also walk out , Reuters reports . 
Resident doctors are those who have graduated from medical school and are training as specialist consultants . 
They are pivotal to frontline healthcare in Nigeria as they dominate the emergency wards in its hospitals . 
Strikes are common in Nigeria â€™s public health system , with clinicians frequently seeking pay rises and improvements to under funded infrastructure to meet the rising burden of healthcare in the West African country of 200 million people . 
" If the government fails to meet our minimum demands within two weeks , the resident doctors working in [ Covid 19 ] isolation centres will automatically join the strike , " Aliyu Sokomba , the head of the union , said in a statement . 
The doctors are seeking a Covid 19 pay supplement in addition to life insurance for doctors and more funds in the federal budget for their training , among other demands . 
The union has complained about inadequate protective equipment to treat Covid 19 patients and has said that ten doctors have died so far from the highly infectious respiratory disease .
