US airline passengers who refuse to wear facial coverings could have their flying privileges revoked , the industry â€™s main lobby group said on Monday . 
As of now , major US airlines may deny anyone not wearing a mask from boarding and provide the coverings to passengers who have none , according to Reuters . 
Once on board , however , flight attendants have little power to enforce the policy if passengers remove their masks . 
The US government has no mandate on the matter . 
Carriers implementing the new policy include Alaska Airlines , American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , Hawaiian Airlines , Jet Blue Airways , Southwest Airlines and United Airlines , Airlines for America said in a statement . 
The measures are expected to remain in place throughout the Covid 19 public health crisis , it said .
