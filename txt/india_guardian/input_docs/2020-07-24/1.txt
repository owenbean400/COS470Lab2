Here are some more details on the latest WHO figures : The organisation reported 69,641 new cases in the United States , 67,860 in Brazil , 49,310 in India and 13,104 in South Africa . 
The largest increases in new deaths were 3,876 in Peru , 1,284 in Brazil , 1,074 in the United States , 790 in Mexico and 740 in India . 
Peru recently reviewed its Covid 19 data and in one day increased its total death toll by 3,000 to a total of over 17,000 fatalities . 
On 17 July , India became the third country in the world to record more than 1 million cases , behind only the United States and Brazil . 
Epidemiologists say India is still likely months from hitting its peak . 
Cases in Brazil crossed the 2 million mark on 16 July , doubling in less than a month as the country adds nearly 40,000 new cases a day . 
A patchwork of state and city responses has held up poorly in Brazil , in the absence of a tightly coordinated policy from the federal government . 
The United States , which is the world â€™s worst hit country with more than 4 million cases , has also tried to curb the outbreak at the state and local level , with only limited success .
