While the rest of India prepares to reopen , individual states are identifying high risk zones where lockdowns will stay in place . 
Prime minister Narendra Modi ’s government has extended lockdown until 30 June in these ‘ containment ’ zones that continue to report high infection numbers . 
Outside the zones , restaurants , malls and religious buildings will be allowed to reopen from 8 June , in a relaxation of the world ’s longest coronavirus lockdown . 
The number of cases confirmed in India has reached a daily record high during the past 48 hours , and critics argue Modi is leaving the responsibility of dealing with the virus up to individual states . 
In India ’s most populous state , Uttar Pradesh , 1,111 zones have been identified , while in Gujarat over 400,000 houses were marked as high risk zones . 
Officials in the western state of Maharastra said all markets , except malls and congested spaces , will be allowed to function in a staggered manner .
