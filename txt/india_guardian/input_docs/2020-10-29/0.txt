Brazil expects to have a vaccine against Covid 19 approved and ready for use in a national inoculation programme by June , the head of the country ’s health regulator , Anvisa , said . 
With the world ’s worst outbreak of coronavirus after the US and India , Brazil has become a key testing ground and has approved late stage clinical trials for four vaccines that are under development . 
Anvisa boss Antonio Barra Torres told Reuters the agency has approved vaccines in the past with less than 50 % effectiveness , but did not say what efficacy would be required for the vaccine to be approved . 
Health authorities in Europe are debating whether to accept a so called efficacy rate of less than 50 % to be able to deliver a vaccine sooner , the Wall Street Journal reported this week . 
Sandra Gallina , director general for health and food safety at the European Commission , told EU lawmakers the article was speculation , but added that it ’s not rare to have vaccines that only work with 50 % efficacy . 
Last week , Brazil ’s right wing president Jair Bolsonaro disavowed a decision by his health minister to buy 46m doses of a vaccine from China ’s Sinovac Biotech , saying : " We will not buy a Chinese vaccine . " 
But Torres said Anvisa could register more than one of the four candidates now being tested in Brazil , irrespective of their country of origin . 
" The origin of the vaccine has no bearing for us , there is no prejudice , " he said .
