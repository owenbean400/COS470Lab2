The former chancellor , George Osborne , has called on the government to dramatically expand its support for British businesses by underwriting bank loans worth hundreds of billions of pounds to support firms struggling as the coronavirus spreads . 
He reckons the measures outlined by the incumbent , Rishi Sunak , at the budget last week fall far short of what is required as the economic downturn intensifies , with Britain on the brink of recession and as stock markets crash around the world . 
Time for a massive government scheme to underwrite bank loans to businesses - and help them and their employees through this crisis . 
£ 100s billions pounds in scale . 
Budget measures last week were fine , but not enough At the budget , the government announced it would support up to £ 1bn of state backed lending through the British Business Bank , as part of a wider £ 12bn package of support for households and firms . 
High street banks will also raise their lending by around £ 21bn to provide further support following talks with the Treasury . 
However , the measures stand in stark contrast to much more substantial efforts elsewhere across Europe . 
The French president , Emmanuel Macron , has said the state will underwrite additional loans worth € 300bn ( £ 273.3bn ) – more than 300 times the level of UK support . 
Last week , Germany said it would expand lending at its Kf W state backed investment bank from € 460bn to € 550bn , while saying there was no upper limit on the amount of loans it would issue .
