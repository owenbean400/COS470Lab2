Angela Merkel said in her last new year ’s address to the nation as German chancellor that 2020 was by far the most difficult of her 15 year leadership , yet the start of vaccinations against Covid 19 made 2021 a year of hope . 
In a rare show of emotion , Merkel , who steered Germany and the European Union through the 2008 financial crisis , the Greek debt crisis a year later and the migrant crisis five years ago , condemned a protest movement opposed to lockdowns and said she would get vaccinated when the shot is widely available . 
Let me tell you something personal in conclusion : in nine months a parliamentary election will take place and I wo not be running again . 
Today is therefore in all likelihood the last time I am able to deliver a new year ’s address to you . " 
She added : " I think I am not exaggerating when I say : never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy and never have we , despite all the worries and some scepticism , looked forward to the new one with so much hope . "
