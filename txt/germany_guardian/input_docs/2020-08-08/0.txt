Meat giant , Danish Crown announced Saturday it had closed a large slaughterhouse in Denmark after nearly 150 employees tested positive for the novel coronavirus . 
The abattoir in Ringsted , about 50 kilometres ( 30 miles ) from the capital Copenhagen , employs nearly 900 people and slaughters tens of thousands of pigs every week . 
Danish Crown said 120 employees tested positive for the virus in a first round of tests of 600 employees present . 
It then retested all the negative cases and detected 22 additional infections . 
" For this reason , we are closing the abattoir for at least a week to try to break the chain of transmission among employees on site , " Danish Crown said in a statement . 
All the employees must quarantine , said the company , one of Denmark ’s biggest exporters and the biggest pork product producer in Europe . 
Several European slaughterhouses have been hit with the virus in recent months , particularly in Germany . 
The virus cluster at Ringsted is the main active one in Denmark , where the number of cases has increased sharply in recent days . 
The resurgence has forced the government to abandon plans to ease restrictions at concert halls and night clubs , and instead prepare new curbs . 
Several dozen infections have been registered in Aarhus , the country ’s second biggest city . 
The prime minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday that Denmark intends to make masks compulsory on public transport , even though such a measure had not even been recommended recently .
