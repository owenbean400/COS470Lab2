More than 130 US Secret Service officers assigned to protect Trump have been sidelined by Covid 19 , the Washington Post has reported . 
A US government source familiar with the situation confirmed that numerous Secret Service officers had gone into quarantine but did not provide a specific number . 
Not all those in quarantine had tested positive , the source said . 
The paper did not say how many officers had tested positive for the virus versus those who had to isolate because of close contact with an infected coworker . 
It said about 10 % of the core security team had been sidelined . 
Secret Service representatives declined to give a tally of officers affected . 
The White House spokesman Judd Deere referred questions to the Secret Service , but told the Post separately that the administration took every case seriously .
