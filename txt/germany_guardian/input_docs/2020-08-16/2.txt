The governor of the US state of Georgia , who has opposed local mask mandates and even sued over one in Atlanta , has signed a new executive order that allows local governments to enact mask requirements to help fight the coronavirus pandemic . 
As with previous orders , the one issued Saturday says residents and visitors of the state are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes , except when eating , drinking or exercising outside . 
But unlike previous orders , this one allows local governments in counties that have reached a threshold requirement to require the wearing of masks on government owned property , the Associated Press reports . 
A county meets that threshold requirement if it has had 100 or more confirmed cases of Covid 19 per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days . 
Only two of Georgia â€™s 159 counties were below that threshold , according to data from the state Department of Public Health . 
Local mask mandates cannot result in fines , fees or penalties against private businesses or organisations , and penalties against individuals for non compliance cannot included a fine greater than $ 50 and cannot include prison time , the order says . 
Local mask requirements ca not be enforced on residential property and can only be enforced on private property , including businesses , if the owner or occupant consents to enforcement , the order says . 
This order also protects Georgia businesses from government overreach by restricting the application and enforcement of local masking requirements to public property , " governor Brian Kemp said in a news release accompanying the order , which is in effect through 31 August . 
" While I support local control , it must be properly balanced with property rights and personal freedoms , " he added .
