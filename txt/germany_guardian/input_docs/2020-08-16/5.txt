Jacinda Ardern is coming to the end of this news conference . 
She says she had never considered moving the election out by a year , as she said some other countries have done . 
" We are not proposing to push out for a long period of time , " she says , reiterating that the vote will still happen in the constitutional time allocated for this parliament . 
She acknowledges the potential anxiety caused by delaying the election , but says she wants to assure all voters that their voices will be heard on election day . 
New Zealand spent 102 days with no new cases of Covid 19 , until last week , when four new cases in the city of Auckland were reported . 
This city was returned to Level 3 lockdown rules - initially for 3 days , but that was extended on Friday out to 26 August . 
The rest of the country is alert level 2 . 
As of Sunday , there were 69 active cases of Covid 19 , including 49 cases from the community .
