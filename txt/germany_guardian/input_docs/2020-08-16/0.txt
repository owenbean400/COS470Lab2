The German Federal Cartel Office is investigating the allegation that Amazon abused a market dominating position during the coronavirus pandemic . 
" We are currently investigating whether and how Amazon influences retailers â€™ pricing on the marketplace , " cartel office president Andreas Mundt told the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung . 
During the first months of the pandemic , there were complaints that Amazon had blocked retailers because of allegedly excessive prices . 
" Amazon must not be a price controller . 
That also applies now , " Mundt said . 
Mundt described Amazon as an indispensable platform for many retailers . 
" On the other hand , we have so far not formally established market dominance , " he added . 
Germany is the second largest market for the US group after the United States .
