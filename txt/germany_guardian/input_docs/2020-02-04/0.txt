The AFP agency reports that the foreign ministers of France and Germany are considering the possibility that Europe could impose a US style ban on foreign visitors who have recently been to China , in an effort to battle the spread of coronavirus . 
" Indeed , there is the question of possible travel restrictions or at least increased examination [ of travellers ) at the border , " Germany ’s Jens Spahn said at a meeting in Paris with his French counterpart Agnes Buzyn . 
He was responding to a question about whether Europe would consider a ban similar to that imposed by the United States , which China has accused of spreading " panic " . 
" It makes no sense that a single country takes measures " on a continent with border free travel between most nations , said Spahn . 
The new coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000 in China since emerging in December and has now spread to more than 20 other countries . 
Buzyn agreed that travel restriction " is one of the questions for European ministers . 
We must have a coherent vision in the [ passport free ] Schengen area . 
There is no sense in one country taking this type of decision while citizens move around freely . " 
Buzyn said they would ask the Croatian presidency of the EU council to call a meeting of health ministers within days to discuss further measures needed in the face of the coronavirus crisis . 
" We would like … closer cooperation so that we have exactly the same measures in all countries in order to be consistent in Europe since there is this free movement of people , and we wish to maintain this free movement . "
