The boss at the firm behind the Oxford vaccine believes it has found the " winning formula " to improve the jab ’s efficacy . 
The UK government has ordered 100m doses of the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine , with about 40m available by the end of March . 
There have been some concerns the Oxford vaccine may not be as good as preventing symptomatic disease as the other vaccines such as the one by Pfizer already being distributed . 
Astra Zeneca chief Pascal Soriot said : " We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that , after two doses , is up there with everybody else . 
" I ca not tell you more because we will publish at some point . " 
He told The Sunday Times of the figures already released on the jab : " We would have preferred a simpler set of results , but overall we thought these are positive , they meet the criteria established by regulators around the world . " 
" We assumed people would be a bit disappointed , that ’s for sure , " he went on . 
" But we did not expect that storm . " 
His comments come as the Sunday Telegraph reports the Oxford jab could be rolled out en masse from a few days into the new year . 
According to the newspaper , the government hopes that the approval could mean more than 2 million people could receive their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine within a fortnight , with doses of the Oxford medicine available from 4 January . 
A UK government spokesperson said : " The medicines regulator is reviewing the final data from the University of Oxford/Astra Zeneca phase three clinical trials to determine whether the vaccine meets their strict standards of quality , safety and effectiveness . 
" We must now give the MHRA the time to carry out its important work and we must wait for its advice . "
