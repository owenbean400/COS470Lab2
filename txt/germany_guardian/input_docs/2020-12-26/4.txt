It was over breakfast on the wintry morning of 24 January that Ozlem Tureci and her husband , Ugur Sahin , decided " we need to fire the starting gun on this " . 
Sahin " had concluded from a publication describing coronavirus cases in Wuhan ... that there was a high probability that a pandemic could be imminent " , Tureci recounted . 
The decision by the couple , founders of a small German company called Bio NTech , gave birth to Operation Lightspeed – in which the scientists in the company diverted all their resources from cancer therapy research to finding a vaccine to stop Covid 19 . 
Since that day ... there has not been a day when we took a break from working on this project , " said Tureci . 
Four days later , on 28 January , Germany confirmed its first case of coronavirus infection – also the first known human to human transmission on European soil . 
What was an epidemic hitting China hardest soon morphed into a global health crisis , forcing governments to close borders , schools and offices and keep their populations at home to halt the spread . 
As Bio NTech and other pharmaceutical companies leapt into action in search of the winning formula , Germany ’s army of " Mittelstand " companies and other bigger manufacturing and logistics experts would soon prove crucial . 
Just a few minutes ’ drive away from Bio NTech ’s headquarters in the city of Mainz , one such company quietly ramped up production . 
Little known to the rest of the world , the 130 year old firm Schott is in fact a major player in the pharmaceutical industry because of its little glass vials designed to hold lifesaving vaccines . 
Three quarters of the more than 100 coronavirus inoculation trials across the world would end up using Schott products . 
The company alone aims to produce enough vials to hold2bn doses of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2021 , head of communications Christina Rettig told AFP .
