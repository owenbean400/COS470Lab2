Egypt has seen a sharp increase in the number of officially confirmed coronavirus cases over the past week . 
The health ministry recorded 1,189 new cases and 43 deaths on Saturday , bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 131,315 cases including 7,352 deaths . 
Health experts and some government officials say the real numbers are likely to be much higher due to the low rate of public PCR testing and the exclusion of private test results from the ministry â€™s figures . 
A fire killed at least seven people and injured several others on Saturday at a private hospital that was treating coronavirus patients on the outskirts of Cairo , local sources and media said .
