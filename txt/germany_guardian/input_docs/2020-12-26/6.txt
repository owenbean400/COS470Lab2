Iran is extending a night time traffic curfew to 330 lower risk cities and towns in an effort to sustain a recent decline in the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths , state television reported . 
Alireza Raisi , spokesman for the national coronavirus task force , said on state TV that a curfew running from 9pm to 4am – already in place in 108 " orange , " or medium risk , cities – will be extended to lower risk " yellow " areas on Sunday . 
The curfew , under which the use of private cars is banned to reduce the level of contacts between people , resulted in nearly 100,000 fines on one night in the past week . 
The health ministry said 134 people had died of Covid 19 in the past 24 hours , the lowest since 13 September , taking total deaths to 54,574 in the Middle East ’s worst affected country . 
There were 5,760 new cases , the lowest since 22 October , bringing the total to 1,194,964 . 
Iran said it had received approval from US authorities to buy coronavirus vaccines from the World Health Organization led Covax alliance . 
It did not say which vaccines it was buying . 
The head of Iran ’s Red Crescent Society told state TV that , separate from the government , it was planning to import an unnamed Chinese vaccine . 
Asked about possible concerns over the drug ’s safety , the Red Crescent chief , Karim Hemmati , said : All imported vaccines and medicines undergo controls by ( Iran ’s ) Food and Drug Administration ... 
So there is no problem there . " 
In televised remarks on Saturday , President Hassan Rouhani reiterated Iran ’s complaint that US sanctions have made it difficult to make payments for vaccines . 
" We arranged money from a bank to buy vaccines from Covax but they said you need ( US ) approval , " he said .
