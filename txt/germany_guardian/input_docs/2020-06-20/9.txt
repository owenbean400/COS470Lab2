The Palestinian Authority said on Saturday it was temporarily closing the cities of Hebron and Nablus in the occupied West Bank to contain the spread of coronavirus after a sharp rise in infections . 
" The government decided to close the governorate of Hebron to prevent anyone from entering or exiting , with the exception of the transport of merchandise , " Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said . 
He told a news conference that Hebron would be closed for five days and Nablus for 48 hours , according to AFP . 
The measures come after an increase in Covid 19 infections in both cities . 
Hebron saw 48 new cases on Saturday , bringing the total to 258 , while authorities have reported 23 cases in Nablus .
