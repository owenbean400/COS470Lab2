The Democratic Republic of the Congo â€™s mines ministry has proposed lifting lockdowns at mining operations after workers went on strike to protest compulsory on site confinements during the coronavirus outbreak , Agence France Presse reports . 
Human rights organisations said earlier this month that mining workers in the vast African country were being forced to stay in overcrowded , unsanitary accommodations . 
During a council meeting on Friday government ministers acknowledged the " abysmal housing conditions " of employees in the mineral rich Katanga region . 
Since a lockdown was put in place on 10 March by companies producing cobalt and copper , many employees have been forced to work beyond their eight hour shifts with no additional pay , according to a group of local and international NGOs .
