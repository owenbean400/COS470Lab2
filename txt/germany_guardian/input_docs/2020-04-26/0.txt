Germany â€™s labour minister Hubertus Heil is working on legislation that would give employees the right to work from home , even after the current crisis when social distancing will be no longer needed . 
" Everyone who wants to and whose workplace allows it should be able to work in a home office , even when the coronavirus pandemic is over , " Heil told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper . 
About 25 % of Germans are now estimated to be working from home , up from about 12 % normally . 
Heil said he would table legislation later in the year to enshrine the right to work from home in law , even full time if that is what employees want . 
Finance minister Olaf Scholz , like Heil a Social Democrat , expressed approval for the idea . 
" The past weeks have shown how much is possible in the home office , this is a real achievement that we should not just abandon , " he told the paper .
