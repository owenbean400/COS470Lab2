The quarantine policy for passengers arriving in England from " lower risk countries " such as Spain , France , Italy and Germany will be lifted , the Department for Transport ( Df T ) has announced . 
A full list of countries from which arrivals will not need to self isolate for 14 days will be published later on Friday . 
The new measures come into force from July 10 . 
All passengers except for those in certain categories will continue to be required to provide contact information on arrival . 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will set out a number of destinations which will be exempt from its policy of advising against all non essential overseas travel . 
That change will come into effect on Saturday , allowing people to take holidays overseas with regular travel insurance policies . 
The Df T said the devolved administrations " will set out their own approach " , which means passengers arriving in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland " should ensure they follow the laws and guidance which applies there " .
