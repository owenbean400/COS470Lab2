European countries were on Tuesday given a clear timeframe for the start of their vaccination programmes after the EU ’s medicines regulator said it would decide by 29 December whether to grant emergency approval for the first Covid 19 jabs , AFP reports . 
France plans to prioritise the most fragile and exposed groups in early 2021 , followed by a second campaign for the rest of the population between April and June , the president Emmanuel Macron announced . 
Germany has already said it is hoping to launch its immunisation drive in the first quarter of 2021 and is preparing vaccination centres across the country . 
The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) said it would hold an extraordinary meeting on 29 December " at the latest " to consider emergency approval for a vaccine developed by Germany ’s Bio NTech and US giant Pfizer . 
Hopes that shots could be ready for use by the end of this year received a boost when US firm Moderna said it was filing Monday for emergency authorisation of its vaccine in the United States and Europe . 
The EMA said it would hold a separate meeting to assess that request by 12 January at the latest . 
Large scale trial data released last month showed that both vaccines were safe and around 95 percent effective against Covid 19 . 
European Commission spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker told reporters that once the EMA gave regulatory permission , formal authorisation from Brussels would follow " very quickly " , probably " in a matter of days " .
