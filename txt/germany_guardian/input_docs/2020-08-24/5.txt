Uganda has recalled its ambassador to Denmark and her deputy , after the pair were recorded apparently plotting in a Zoom meeting to steal funds meant to deal with the Covid 19 crisis . 
During the meeting , a video of which circulated on social media , the ambassador Nimisha Madhvani , her deputy and other staff members are heard devising a plot to share out money which was meant to aid stranded citizens . 
They appear to suggest that instead of registering the money for Covid 19 use , it should be apportioned as an allowance over eight days for the diplomats . 
" Give yourselves $ 4,000 ... " deputy ambassador Elly Kamahungye is heard to say , admitting there would be " jumbled accounts " while recalling how diplomats were able to bribe auditors to shelve a previous probe into embassy accounts . 
Nimisha herself suggests that staff members " find a way " to use the money . 
Uganda ’s foreign ministry ’s permanent secretary Patrick Mugoya pledged a full investigation in a statement on Monday , saying " the ministry wishes to express grave concern about the allegations ... and takes this matter seriously " . 
" In the meantime , the officers implicated have been recalled to the ministry headquarters to pave way for the investigations . "
