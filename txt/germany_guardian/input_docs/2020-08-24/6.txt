Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro continued his attack on journalists during a public event on Monday , describing reporters as " wimps " and saying they have a heightened chance of dying of Covid 19 because they are not athletic . 
The right wing former army captain has long had a fractious relationship with the media , frequently singling out specific newspapers and journalists for his ire . 
His followers have also attacked journalists at rallies and other public events . 
On Sunday , Bolsonaro told a reporter , " I want to punch you in the face , " after the reporter asked about thousands of dollars that were transferred into a bank account of the president ’s wife by a former aide who is now the target of a corruption probe . 
During the Monday event , titled Defeating Covid 19 , Bolsonaro described his own experience battling the virus in July , crediting his use of unproven drug hydroxychloroquine and his self described history as an athlete for his mild symptoms . 
He has previously said he believed his athletic past made him immune to the worst of the coronavirus . 
" That history of an athlete , the press feasted on it , but when ( Covid 19 ) gets one of you wimps , your chance of surviving is quite a bit lower , " Bolsonaro told reporters , using the Portuguese colloquial word bundao . 
He added : You only know how to do evil , to use a pen largely for evil . 
Your chance of surviving is quite a bit lower . 
Earlier this month , local media reported that the aide , Fabricio Queiroz , deposited 72,000 reais ( $ 12,900 ) in checks into Michelle Bolsonaro ’s account between 2011 and 2018 . 
Queiroz was an aide to now Senator Flavio Bolsonaro , the president ’s eldest son , when he was a Rio de Janeiro state legislator . 
The former aide has been arrested in an investigation into bank deposits made at the time , amounting to 1.2m reais .
