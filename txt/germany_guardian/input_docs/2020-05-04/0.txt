Germany â€™s state premiers will agree on further measures to ease restrictions during a telephone call with the chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday , Reuters reports citing two people familiar with the preparations . 
The state premiers are expected to give the green light for large shops to reopen , probably from 11 May , Reuters says . 
The states will also agree to reopen schools for all grades step by step , though most children will only be allowed to go to class in rotating shifts , not on daily basis , the sources said .
