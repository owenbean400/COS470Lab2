Thousands of Israelis protested on Saturday in Jerusalem and other cities including Tel Aviv , demanding prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s resignation over his government ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic . 
In Jerusalem they rallied outside Netanyahu ’s residence holding up signs accusing him of corruption , a reference to the premier ’s indictment in January for bribery , fraud and breach of trust in three cases , AFP reports . 
He denies all the charges . 
" We are fed up with the corrupt , " some signs read , alongside others reading " Where are the morals ? 
Where are the values ? " 
Protesters also slammed a law passed this week that gives the government special powers to fight the spread of the virus until the end of 2021 . 
Protests against economic fallout from the pandemic have spread across the country in recent weeks . 
In some cases police sprayed demonstrators with water cannons , injuring some . 
Israel won praise for its initial response to the Covid 19 outbreak , but the government has come under criticism amid a resurgence in cases after restrictions were lifted starting in late April .
