Britain ’s Queen Elizabeth II has ticked off another first during lockdown : the virtual unveiling of a new portrait . 
Despite seeing the artwork of herself via videocall , it was clear she has not lost her eagle eye . 
The Queen joked that a tea cup featured in the painting had no tea in it , the artist revealed , as she paid tribute to her " luminous " sitter . 
Miriam Escofet painted the portrait , which was commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) as a " lasting tribute to Her Majesty ’s service " to diplomacy . 
The Queen saw the painting for the first time via her computer screen , before speaking to members of FCO staff about their work around the world during the coronavirus crisis . 
" She seemed to react very positively to it . 
She was smiling , asking how long it took and if I had any more projects on the go after this , " Escofet told PA . 
The painting took seven months to complete , with the final stages finished in lockdown . 
Escofet had two sittings with the Queen - one at Windsor where she spent around half an hour photographing the monarch and the second at Buckingham Palace to focus on her facial expressions .
