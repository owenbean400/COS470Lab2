The British transport secretary Grant Shapps is reportedly on holiday in Spain , which , unless he returns to the UK in the next one and a half hours , might make him subject to the government ’s newly imposed quarantine rules for all travellers returning from Spain . 
NEW : Department for Transport confirm Transport Secretary @ grantshapps is on holiday in Spain . 
He will therefore be among thousands of travellers forced to quarantine for a fortnight when he returns to the UK.#COVID19 However , it is unclear whether the new quarantine rules will apply to government ministers , as a government website states that people " undertaking essential policing or essential government work outside of the UK " will not necessarily have to self isolate . 
Shapps last week became the first senior UK politician to break ranks and declare he was taking a summer holiday abroad this year . 
The transport secretary said he and his wife , Belinda , had decided to take advantage of the relaxation of Foreign Office guidance on non essential overseas travel . 
" My wife looked at all of these new changes that were made and has now booked a break for the first time for a couple of years , " he told BBC Radio 4 ’s Today programme on 18 July .
