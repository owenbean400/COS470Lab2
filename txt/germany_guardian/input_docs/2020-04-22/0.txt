Trump has claimed , once again , that the US is the " best " in the world at testing . 
That ’s not true . 
Overall , the US had administered more than 4.5m coronavirus tests , according to the Covid Tracking Project . 
From a very slow start , the US , with a population of 329m , had ramped up to a testing rate of one in every 80 people — a bit better than to South Korea ’s rate of 1 in every 90 people . 
Germany has done even better , testing every 1 in 63 people . 
In America , despite the recent increase in testing , backlogs are reported in labs across the country , and many people with symptoms — including health workers — are still struggling to access tests .
