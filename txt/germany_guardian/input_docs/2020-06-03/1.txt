A € 130bn ( £ 116bn ) post lockdown stimulus package has been agreed by the coalition partners running the country , the chancellor Angela Merkel has said . 
Merkel said her conservatives and their Social Democrat coalition partners agreed measures designed to speed up Germany ’s economic recovery after resolving differences on incentives to buy new cars and relief for highly indebted municipalities . 
The agreement paved the way for a fiscal programme that is substantially bigger than similar packages by Germany ’s Eurozone partners .
