The borders of more than a dozen countries in West Africa could be reopened within weeks under proposals from government ministers there . 
The measures could be in place in the first half of July , with travellers from other countries with low or controlled levels of coronavirus spread allowed in by the end of the month . 
Members of the 15 country ECOWAS trade bloc have imposed varying levels of travel restrictions in response to the pandemic , with many shutting their borders entirely . 
The new proposal , contained in an ECOWAS summary of a virtual meeting last week of foreign ministers and trade ministers , called for coordinated efforts to re open cross border trade . 
It said a first phase consisting of opening up domestic air and land transport should be implemented this month . 
Many governments in the region have already begun to do so . 
A second phase , involving the opening of land , air and maritime borders within the region , should happen by 15 July at the latest . 
A third phase , involving the opening of air and land borders to " countries with low and controlled levels of Covid 19 contamination rates " , should occur by 31 July but will depend on the evolution of the pandemic , the report said .
