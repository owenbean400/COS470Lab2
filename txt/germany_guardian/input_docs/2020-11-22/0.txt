A video has gone viral of a confrontation at a coronavirus lockdown protest in Hannover , Germany , where a young woman compared herself to a famous Nazi resistance fighter and then was accused by a security guard of " trivialising " the Holocaust . 
The Associated Press reported that the woman spoke on stage and told fellow protesters " I feel like Sophie Scholl , since I ’ve been active in the resistance , giving speeches , going to protests , distributing flyers . " 
Scholl fought the Nazis with her brother and other members of the resistance group White Rose . 
After distributing flyers at a Munich university , she was convicted of high treason and was executed aged 22 by the Nazis in 1943 . 
While the female protester was talking , a security guard approached the stage , saying repeatedly that " I ’m not going to be a security guard for this kind of idiocy . " and calling her speech " a trivialisation of the Holocaust . " 
He was ushered away and she threw down the mic . 
Rednerin in # Hannover fühlt sich wie Sophie Scholl , da sie " seit Monaten aktiv im Widerstand " sei . 
Ordner wirft daraufhin das Handtuch : " Für so einen Schwachsinn mach ich doch keinen Ordner mehr . 
Das ist Verharmlosung vom Holocaust . " 
Rednerin weint und wirft auch hin . 
# h2111 German foreign minister Heiko Maas tweeted that the comparison with Scholl " mocks the bravery that was needed to take a stand against the Nazis . " 
He wrote : " Nothing connects the corona protests with the resistance fighters . 
Nothing ! " 
There have been just over 14,000 coronavirus related deaths in Germany , about a quarter of those in the UK .
