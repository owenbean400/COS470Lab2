Belgium will allow shops to reopen from Tuesday , prime minister Alexander De Croo said , but the country ’s semi lockdown will remain in place to bring down coronavirus infections . 
" The situation in our country is improving ... but it ’s important to keep a lid on things , " De Croo said , warning that the Christmas and New Year holidays would be " different " this year . 
So far , only retailers of essential goods , such as food , have been allowed to stay open . 
But the move to allow other shops to resume business mirrors similar easing measures in Germany , Luxembourg and the Netherlands . 
Bars , restaurants and cafes will remain closed and people will continue to be required to work from home where possible , limit social contacts . 
A curfew from midnight to 5am ( 2300-0400 GMT ) will also remain in place . 
This year " we will celebrate Christmas with our families , in small numbers . 
It will be more intimate , " the prime minister said . 
There would also be no fireworks at New Year . 
We must not spoil in four days what we ’ve achieved in four weeks , " De Croo said , but suggested a more general easing of restrictions might be possible from mid January if infection numbers continue to come down . 
The premier also advised people not to travel to other countries with higher caseloads and said that border controls would be put in place and quarantine requirements imposed for travellers returning from virus hotspots . 
Belgium has recorded nearly 570,000 infections since the start of the pandemic , but recently appears to be getting the situation under control . 
An average 2,765 daily cases were registered last week , just a fifth of the number last month . 
Authorities hope to bring that cases down to around 500 per day by the end of the year .
