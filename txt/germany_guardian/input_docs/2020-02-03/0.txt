In Germany , eight people have tested positive for the virus so far . 
Seven of them , five Germans and two Chinese nationals , are employees of the car parts supplier Webasto , headquartered in Stockdorf , Bavaria . 
The eighth is the child of one of the employees . 
All eight patients were in a " stable clinical condition " and had only shown " flu like symptoms " , said a spokesperson for the Bavarian health ministry . 
Four of the infected Webasto employees had taken part in a training workshop run by a Chinese employee who only started to feel ill on her return flight to China , where she subsequently tested positive for the 2019 n Cov virus . 
The company â€™s headquarters in Stockdorf was disinfected by experts over the weekend and was to remain closed until Tuesday . 
A further 140 employees were tested for the virus , with 80 of them being ordered to stay indoors and avoid human contact even though their test results had returned negative .
