The World Health Organization has urged governments to engage with people demonstrating against Covid 19 restrictions and listen to their concerns , but stressed protesters needed to understand the virus is dangerous . 
Asked about recent demonstrations in a number of countries against coronavirus restrictions , the WHO director general , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , said it was important to " listen to what people are asking , what people are saying " . 
" We should engage in an honest dialogue , " he told reporters , stressing though that demonstrators have a responsibility to ensure protests are safe . 
" The virus is real . 
It is dangerous . 
It moves fast and it kills , " he said , insisting " we have to do everything to protect ourselves and to protect others " . 
German police on Saturday halted a Berlin march of tens of thousands of people opposed to coronavirus restrictions in the biggest of several European protests against facemask rules and other anti virus curbs . 
Several hundred of the Berlin protesters then broke through barriers and a police cordon to storm Germany â€™s parliament , in a move German chancellor Angela Merkel condemned as " shameful " . 
Speaking about the broader protests , the WHO emergencies chief , Dr Mike Ryan , pointed out that " epidemics and emergencies create strong emotions , and acceptance of measures is always very , very tough " . 
It is really important that governments do not overreact to people protesting against measures . 
The real important thing to do is to enter into a dialogue with groups .
