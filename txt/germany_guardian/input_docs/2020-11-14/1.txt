The German government has released a tongue in cheek ad hailing an unlikely hero in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic : the humble couch potato . 
AP reports : The 90 second video posted online Saturday begins with an elderly man recalling his ‘ service ’ to the nation back when he was just a young student " in the winter of 2020 , when the whole country ’s eyes were on us . " 
" I had just turned 22 and was studying engineering , " he continues , " when the second wave hit . " 
With violins stirring at viewers ’ heart strings , the setting switches to a scene of the narrator as a young man . 
" Suddenly the fate of this country lay in our hands , " he says . 
" So we mustered all our courage and did what was expected of us , the only right thing . 
We did nothing . " 
" Days and nights we stayed on our backsides at home and fought against the spread of the coronavirus , " the narrator continues . 
" Our couch was the front line and our patience was our weapon . " 
The ad ends with a government message that " you too can become a hero by staying at home . " 
Germany imposed fresh restrictions to curb the spread of COVID 19 at the start of November , shutting restaurants , bars and gyms , and setting limits on the number of people who can meet in public and private settings .
