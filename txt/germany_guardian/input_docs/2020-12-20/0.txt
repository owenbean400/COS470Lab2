As many rushed to leave the UK before the travel restrictions were active , NYTimes correspondent , Patrick Kingsley , is reporting from Germany that foreign residents will have to spend the night in an airport in Berlin , until the COVID test centre opens at 6 am . 
Foreign residents on the last flight into Berlin from London have been separated from the German citizens and will spend the night in the airport until the test center opens at 6am . 
Germans allowed through without a test Now foreign residents with a registered address in Germany have been told they can enter the country . 
Still unclear though .
