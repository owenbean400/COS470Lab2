Germany should continue restricting the number of people allowed to gather in groups and crack down on unnecessary travel , an adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel has said . 
" We must be a bit stricter in places where infection chains spread mostly , which is parties and , unfortunately , also travel , " the chancellor ’s chief of staff , Helge Braun , told public broadcaster ARD . 
" We are at the beginning of a second wave and only the politicians ’ and the population ’s determination will decide whether or not we can avoid it , or slow it down , " he added . 
Infections and deaths had remained lower in the country than in many of its European neighborus , but the daily number of new cases has leapt above 4,000 since Thursday , the highest since April . 
Tougher penalties are on the cards , with Bavaria ’s prime minister , Markus Soeder , at the weekend proposing steeper fines for people not wearing masks where mandated in places such as public transport and shops . 
They should rise to € 250 compared with the current € 50 and € 500 for repeat offenders , he said .
