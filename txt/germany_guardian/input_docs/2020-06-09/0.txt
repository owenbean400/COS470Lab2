The leaders of six European Union nations have called for building up EU stocks of critical medicines and equipment and other measures to boost the bloc â€™s long term resilience to public health crises . 
The 27 nation EU and Britain have reported some 1.4m cases , or about a fifth of the global total . 
At the height of the crisis , many EU states resorted to protectionist measures , raising trade barriers to hinder the export of medical equipment to their neighbours . 
In a joint paper sent to European commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday , the leaders of Denmark , Spain and Germany , as well as France , Belgium and Poland , backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment . 
A broader , holistic EU strategy could be more efficient than each member state attempting to enhance preparedness on their own .
