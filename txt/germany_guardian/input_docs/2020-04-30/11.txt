Meanwhile , Alberta unveiled a plan to reopen its economy gradually , starting on Monday with some non urgent surgeries , golf courses and services such as physiotherapists and social workers . 
The next stage begins as early as May 14 , reopening retail businesses , hair salons , daycares and restaurants . 
Moving to that stage hinges on increased testing and contact tracing , and rules for using masks in crowded spaces . 
Alberta has not set dates for reopening schools . 
Ontario , which has not set dates to restart its economy , issued more than 60 guidelines for businesses when they reopen , ranging from markers and barriers to maintain physical distancing , and additional labor inspectors to ensure compliance .
