Hospitals in England are conducting " major incident " stress tests on wards to check if they are ready for a second wave of Covid 19 , as the number of admissions begins to climb . 
Coronavirus cases have been doubling roughly every seven days and there are signs the increase is beginning to filter through to hospitals . 
Last Wednesday , 136 patients were admitted in England , twice as many as on any day in the previous week , with a total of 863 people receiving treatment .
