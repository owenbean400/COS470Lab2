Refusing to allow coronavirus to steal his Christmas , one Bavarian innkeeper has opened a drive through Christmas market , complete with artificial snow that falls as you come in , Reuters reports . 
Some 2,500 Christmas markets are usually held in Germany in the lead up to the holiday , drawing millions of visitors who sip mulled wine and buy trinkets among wooden huts . 
But most markets are likely to be cancelled this year due to the pandemic , including Nuremberg ’s world famous " Christkindlesmarkt . " 
Five months after Patrick Schmidt condensed the Bavarian " Dult " folk festival experience into a drive through delight during the first wave of the pandemic , he is now trying to recreate the Christmas market feeling while sticking to guidelines for social distancing . 
" It was a spontaneous idea because of the second lockdown . 
I thought the Dult drive in also worked so why not a Christmas market drive in ? " he beamed at the market ’s opening on Thursday in Landshut , some 60km ( 37 mile ) northeast of Munich . 
" We do not just sell a crepe or a pack of roasted almonds , we sell an experience . " 
Patrons said the market comes as a welcome boost as the country grinds through a month long " lockdown light " under which bars , restaurants , theatres and museums have been closed . 
" I heard Christmas carols for the first time and I ’m slowly getting into the mood , " said Anton Kolbinger , holding cotton candy . 
" But to get into a real Christmas mood will still take some time . " 
Schmidt said he already knows what he wants for Christmas : My biggest Christmas wish is that the coronavirus is finally brought under control and that next year is half way normal again . 
That ’s what I hope for .
