All arrivals coming to Germany from high risk areas are subject to compulsory coronavirus testing since Saturday , amid a rise in the country ’s infections . 
On Sunday morning , the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) reported 555 new infections , markedly lower than on the previous three days , which saw infections topping 1,000 for three days in a row . 
If you have arrived in Germany since Saturday , I am keen to hear about your experience . 
If you have updates on the pandemic from any other place in the world , I ’d also love to hear from you , you can message me on Twitter @ Jedy Says or email me .
