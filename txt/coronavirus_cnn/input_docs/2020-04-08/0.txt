The US Food and Drug Administration has sent a letter to a firm marketing a product that falsely claims to " cure , mitigate , treat , prevent , or diagnose Coronavirus and/or Covid 19 in people , " according to a press release from the agency . 
The letter was sent to Genesis II Church of Health and Healing and multiple websites associated with the firm . 
It targeted the " Miracle Mineral Solution " -- a chlorine dioxide product -- which was marketed as prevention and treatment for coronavirus . 
The FDA has issued previous warnings that chlorine dioxide poses a significant risk to health and is not shown to be safe and effective for any health use . 
The recipient of the warning letter has 48 hours to provide documentation that misleading claims have been corrected , along with outlining what steps are being taken to prevent future recurrences . 
Failure to do so " may result in legal action , including , without limitation , seizure and injunction , " according to the letter sent Wednesday . 
CNN has reached out to Genesis II Church of Health and Healing for comment .
