Coronavirus can spread " like wildfire , " especially when people are packed together , said Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the United States ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Fauci cited the " explosion " of cases that quickly developed on the USS Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship . 
Cases can take off again if people do not maintain social distancing and other measures to reduce the spread of the virus , Fauci said . 
The model from the University of Washington â€™s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation was updated Monday and now projects 134,475 total deaths in the US from the novel coronavirus by August 4 . 
Fauci said he is very sensitive to the downsides of physical distancing and the economic crisis these policies have caused . 
But he said mitigation efforts work and are still key to keeping the numbers of cases and deaths down , even if people disagree with the need for physical distancing . 
He said he knows people are going to make their own choices .
