Coronavirus can hit may young adults hard , new research shows . 
One in five young adults hospitalized for Covid 19 needs intensive care and 2.7 % of them die , according to research published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine . 
The researchers said that young adults with certain health issues could be just as susceptible to the virus as middle aged adults without them . 
A team of researchers from Brigham and Women â€™s Hospital in Boston studied 3,222 Covid 19 patients between 18 and 34 who were treated at 419 US hospitals . 
About 21 % of these patients ended up in the intensive care unit and 10 % needed a ventilator . 
Eighty eight patients , or 2.7 % , died . 
The researchers said that this in hospital death rate is lower than the rate reported for older adults with Covid 19 . 
For comparison , they note that the rate is about double the death rate for young adults with heart attacks . 
Many patients had underlying health conditions , which put them at greater risk of negative outcomes . 
The team identified 24.5 % of patients with morbid obesity , 18.2 % with diabetes and 16.1 % with high blood pressure . 
" Young adults with more than one of these conditions faced risks comparable with those observed in middle aged adults without them , " they wrote . 
Black and Hispanic people accounted for 57 % of the hospitalized patients , which is in line with reports of minority people of all ages being hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic . 
The researchers noted that odds of death or mechanical ventilation did not vary significantly among different races . 
Research published in July found that one in three young adults is at risk of severe Covid 19 . 
As rates of the virus increase among the younger population , the team says their findings highlight the importance of infection control among young adults .
