There has been a spike in coronavirus cases in Washington , DC , according to data from the DC Department of Health . 
The increase could pose a setback for the criteria Mayor Muriel Bowser is using to decide when the city will begin stage one of its reopening . 
Until this weekend , Washington had 11 days of declining community spread of the coronavirus . 
The city said 14 days of decline were needed as one of the measurements necessary before moving to stage one of reopening . 
Sunday would have been the 13th day of decline -- but instead there was a small spike over the last two days . 
Since the spike was small , the DC Department of Health said Sunday it would consider this a reset back to day 11 of the decline because the number of cases was fewer than the department â€™s calculation of the standard deviation for the number of cases . 
" We do not have to go to day zero , " Director of the DC Department of Health , Dr . 
La Quandra Nesbitt , said in a news conference call . 
Bowser said last week that Washington could begin stage one of its reopening on Friday , May 29 , barring any spikes in cases . 
With this increase in cases , DC could still have 14 days of decline before potentially reopening this Friday . 
Nesbitt would not comment on whether this reset affects when Washington could begin reopening . 
There are two other factors for reopening : A less than 20 % positivity rate and hospital capacity less than 80 % . 
As of Sunday , the positivity rate is 19 % , and the hospital capacity is 74 % .
