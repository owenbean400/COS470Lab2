Coronavirus cases have grown exponentially across the United States just in the past week and it was necessary that " we need to mask up the entire country now , " Dr . Jonathan Reiner , CNN medical analyst , said Friday . 
" The move should be a national mask mandate , " Reiner , who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University , told CNN ’s Erin Burnett . 
" The President should be on the phone with every governor tonight doing that . " 
While some have argued that it is their right to choose not to wear a mask , Reiner said , there is a fine line between a libertarian ethic and selfishness . 
Reiner cited Vice President Mike Pence ’s recent comments that help is on the way to the American people , in the form of a vaccine . 
" Help is not on the way . 
A vaccine will take a couple of months to really make an impact , " he said . 
" If you 're having a heart attack and you call 911 and I tell you that the ambulance is coming two months from now , that should offer you no comfort . " 
No vaccine has received Food and Drug Administration authorization , and experts agree approval would take several weeks to come through from the time a company applied for it . 
But studies show more universal mask use would cut the infection rate greatly . 
" What people need is a mask mandate , and they need it now , " Reiner said .
