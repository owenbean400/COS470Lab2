Coronavirus can infiltrate the diaphragm , perhaps interfering with a patient ’s ability to breathe , researchers reported Monday . 
Researchers with Amsterdam University Medical Centers examined the diaphragm muscle from autopsies of 26 patients who had died from Covid 19 and eight patients who did not have coronavirus in the Netherlands in April and May of this year . 
The diaphragm sits at the base of the chest and plays an important role in breathing . 
The team found evidence of coronavirus in the diaphragm of four of the patients who died from Covid 19 , the team reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine . 
The diaphragm muscle has cells rich in a cellular doorway called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE 2 ) , which they say provides " an entry point for SARS Co V 2 to infect diaphragm myofibers . " 
The team also found increased evidence of fibrosis , a response to injury or damage , in the diaphragm . 
In fact , they found the level of fibrosis was more than two times higher in the diaphragms of coronavirus patients than non coronavirus patients . 
The team suggests that severely weakened or damaged diaphragm muscles linked with coronavirus infection may lead to persistent difficulty breathing and fatigue . 
They also say this could make it more difficult for these patients to be weaned off of ventilators . 
About 92 % of the patients studied needed help breathing with mechanical ventilation . 
The length of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay was comparable between the coronavirus and non coronavirus patients . 
The researchers say it ’s still unclear whether damaged or weak diaphragm muscle is a direct effect of coronavirus infection .
