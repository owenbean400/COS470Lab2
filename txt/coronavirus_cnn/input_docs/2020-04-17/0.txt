Jason Hartelius , who is recovering from coronavirus , shared a video on social media of him unable to take a full breath and breaking into coughing fits . 
On day two in the hospital , Hartelius said he thought about the reality of him dying . 
He was put on oxygen and given a drug to treat pneumonia . 
It â€™s been one month since Hartelius started experiencing symptoms of coronavirus . 
Thirty days later , he is still experiencing fatigue and got a little winded when he walked around his block for the first time . 
His advice for others at this point is to exercise caution . 
" You may say you 're fine . 
You may say you 're low risk . 
You know what ? 
You might get it , not know it , go back to work thinking you 're fine , never have any symptoms . 
You could give it to people you work with who could get very sick or die . 
That 's what I want people to understand . 
That 's why I put the video out there , " he said .
