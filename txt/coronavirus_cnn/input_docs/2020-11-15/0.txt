Rising coronavirus cases may push hospitals past capacity and force states to shut down , Dr . Jonathan Reiner , CNN Medical Analyst and professor of medicine at George Washington University , said Saturday . 
The US is headed towards " an intolerable number of deaths , " Reiner told CNN ’s Ana Cabrera . 
Reiner said the continued rise in cases will result in hospital intensive care units ( ICU ) reaching capacity . 
Reiner said that governors will start to institute restrictions and shutdowns in their states . 
" They 'll do it when their hospitals are saturated . 
They 'll do it whether they want to or not . 
They 'll do it whether the outgoing President wants them to or not , " he said . 
It ’s not entirely too late to turn things around , Reiner noted .
