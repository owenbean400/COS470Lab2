A planeful of Japanese business travelers landed in Vietnam on Thursday , marking the first flight between the two countries since they imposed border restrictions in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus .

But the two countries are now easing their restrictions , allowing a chartered flight arranged by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam from Tokyo 's Narita airport to northern Vietnam on Thursday .
