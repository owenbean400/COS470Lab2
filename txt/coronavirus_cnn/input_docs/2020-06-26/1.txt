Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said Friday that the White House coronavirus task force is " seriously considering " pool testing for Covid 19 . 
The proposal is still in the discussion stage , and is not expected to be announced at the task force briefing later today , Fauci told CNN . 
Dr . Fauci first mentioned the discussions in an interview with The Washington Post published on Friday morning . 
Here 's what " pool testing " means : The strategy works by mixing several samples together into a " batch , " or pool , and then testing the pooled sample with one diagnostic test . 
This way you can test a group of , for example , 25 people with one test rather than 25 separate diagnostic tests . 
If the test comes back negative , then you have eliminated 25 people with one test . 
If you get a positive result you go back and test people individually . 
Fauci 's comments come after the US Food and Drug Administration recommended such a strategy earlier this month on to companies seeking to make tests for mass screening of people for coronavirus . 
And last month , local health authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan said they managed to test more than 9 million people using 6.6 million tests . 
Chinese media reported that Wuhan used a pooled testing approach . 
" What you need to do is find the penetration of infected people in your society , " Fauci told The Washington Post . 
" And the only way you know that is by casting a broad net . " 
Fauci also told The Post that the high levels of asymptomatic spread of the Coronavirus are forcing health experts to rethink how to approach mitigating the spread of Covid 19 . 
" We now know the level of virus in an asymptomatic person is about the same as the level of virus in somebody who has symptoms , " Fauci said . 
" So it â€™s like , oh my goodness , how do you address that ? " 
Fauci stressed to CNN that this is not a new policy , but it is under consideration .
