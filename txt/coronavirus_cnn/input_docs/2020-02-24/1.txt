Detrick continued : What 's this about : Earlier today , US stock markets plunged almost 1,000 points as coronavirus fears mount . 
The Dow has now lost more than 1,400 points in the span of the three trading days . 
That sharp drop wiped out the Dow ’s gains for the year — leaving the index slightly negative for 2020 .
