Coronavirus cases are surging in some Middle Eastern countries that had previously recorded some of the lowest numbers of pandemic cases in the world . 
The last week has seen a series of record new cases in Israel , the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon . 
Israel : Israel , which is tightening lockdown restrictions Friday , identified a record number of cases in a day Thursday . 
Lebanon : Lebanon also hit a new record of 1,027 daily cases Thursday . 
Authorities in the capital of Beirut have recently shied away from putting a lockdown in place to slow the spread of the virus . 
A proactive and strict lockdown during the pandemic ’s first wave in Lebanon kept an outbreak at bay , but it tipped the already fragile economy over the edge , causing poverty rates to soar and the Lebanese pound to tank . 
The United Arab Emirates : The UAE recorded its highest daily total of new cases this week , but has loosened some of its restrictions on entry permits to the country . 
Bahrain : The island kingdom of Bahrain has the highest number of active virus cases per million people in the Arab world , according to a tweet by the American University of Beirut ’s Global Health Institute . 
Lebanon ranks second with 2,628 active cases per million . 
Saudi Arabia : The spread of confirmed virus cases in Saudi Arabia has slowed significantly over the last month . 
The kingdom has identified between 483 and 643 new daily cases in the last two weeks . 
At the peak of Saudi Arabia 's outbreak , authorities had been recording nearly 5,000 new cases each day . 
Qatar and Egypt have also seen a dramatic drop in new virus cases .
