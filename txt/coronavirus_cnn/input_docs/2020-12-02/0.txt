The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and Bio NTech is safe for people who have already had Covid 19 , according to Bio NTech ’s chief medical officer , Dr . Özlem Türeci . 
People who had Covid 19 likely have some immunity to the coronavirus , but it ’s not clear how long that protection lasts . 
Pfizer announced last month that its vaccine was about 95 % effective , when measured seven days after the second dose among people who have had Covid 19 and those who have not . 
According to US Food and Drug Administration guidance to vaccine makers , " vaccine safety and COVID 19 outcomes in individuals with prior SARS Co V 2 infection , who might have been asymptomatic , are important to examine because screening for prior infection is unlikely to occur prior to administration of COVID 19 vaccines under [ emergency use authorization ] . " 
When submitting data to the FDA , the agency says companies should break down the safety and efficacy data by " prior infection status at study entry . " 
Pfizer and Bio NTech applied for an FDA emergency use authorization on November 20 . 
An FDA advisory committee will meet December 10 to discuss the vaccine , and authorization could come shortly after .
