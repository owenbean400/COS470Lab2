Coronavirus killed three times more people in England and Wales than pneumonia and influenza combined in the first eight months of this year , according to new data from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) . 
" More than three times as many deaths were recorded between January and August this year where COVID 19 was the underlying cause compared to influenza and pneumonia , " said Sarah Caul , head of mortality analysis at the ONS . 
" The mortality rate for COVID 19 is also significantly higher than influenza and pneumonia rates for both 2020 and the five year average . " 
The highest number of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia occurred in January 2020 , according to the ONS . 
However , deaths from influenza and pneumonia were below the five year average , from 2015 to 2019 , in every month of 2020 . 
" Since 1959 , which is when ONS monthly death records began , the number of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia in the first eight months of every year have been lower than the number of Covid 19 deaths seen , so far , in 2020 , " said Caul . 
The figures also reveal the toll that coronavirus has taken on care home residents , with the proportion of deaths due to Covid 19 almost double that due to influenza and pneumonia , according to the ONS figures . 
The agency 's analysis of Covid 19 , influenza and pneumonia deaths focuses on deaths where people died due to these conditions , rather than deaths where the conditions were either the underlying cause or mentioned as a contributing factor .
