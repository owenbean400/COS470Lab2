The new coronavirus may never go away and may just join the mix of viruses that kill people around the world every year , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program , said Wednesday . 
" I ’m not comparing the two diseases but I think it is important that we ’re realistic . 
I do not think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear , " Ryan added . 
With a vaccine , " we may have a shot at eliminating this virus but that vaccine will have to be available , it will have to be highly effective , it will have to be made available to everyone and we ’ll have to use it , " Ryan said . 
" This disease may settle into a long term problem or it may not be . " 
Yet the future of coronavirus does not have to be all doom and gloom , according to WHO infectious disease epidemiologist Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove . 
" The trajectory of this outbreak is in our hands , " Van Kerkhove said during Wednesday 's briefing . 
" The global community has come together to work in solidarity , " Van Kerkhove said . 
" We have seen countries bring this virus under control . 
We have seen countries use public health measures . " 
WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus echoed Van Kerkhove 's sentiments on Wednesday and added , " We should all contribute to stop this pandemic . "
