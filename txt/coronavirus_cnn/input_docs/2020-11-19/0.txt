Coronavirus vaccines under development by Moderna and Pfizer have shown extraordinary efficacy , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said Thursday . 
Both makers reported preliminary data that showed their vaccines prevented about 95 % of coronavirus infections . 
Pfizer is expected to seek US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for its vaccine Friday . 
The vaccines prevented both infection and severe disease , Fauci noted in a rare White House coronavirus task force briefing , the first held since July 8 . 
Fauci defended the quick vaccine development process . 
" The process of the speed did not compromise at all safety , nor did it compromise scientific integrity , " he said . 
" We need to put to rest any concept that this was rushed in an inappropriate way , " said Fauci , who , as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , is helping oversee vaccine development . 
" This was solid . "
