If enough Americans get a coronavirus vaccine when one becomes available , it could end this pandemic , the nation ’s leading infectious disease expert , Dr . Anthony Fauci , told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer Monday . 
Some people do not trust vaccines , Fauci said , and there is concern about the reluctance of many people to get a Covid 19 vaccine — or any vaccine for that matter . 
People must understand that this is " extremely important for their own health and , importantly , for the health of the community and health of the nation because if we get a widespread uptake of vaccine , we can put an end to this pandemic and we can create a veil of immunity in this country , preventing the infection from coming back , " he said . 
Fauci said it ’s important to engage on the community level , not from Washington , to convince people a vaccine is safe . 
Two companies are starting advanced coronavirus vaccine trials in the US . 
Moderna started vaccinating the first Phase 3 volunteers for its experimental vaccine Monday , and Pfizer and Bio NTech said they would start a phase 2/3 trial of their vaccine globally and the US this week .
