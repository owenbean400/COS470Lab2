Coronavirus cases are going to surge even higher over the next few weeks , former United States Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr . Scott Gottlieb said during an interview on CNBC on Friday . 
Gottlieb was asked whether the US was heading for a national lockdown as Covid 19 cases surged to more than 125,000 Friday -- the country 's highest single day total since the pandemic started . 
The number of Covid 19 infections is actually much higher , he added . 
Gottlieb said the current surge is different from last spring , when there were concentrated infections in small areas . 
Sixteen states reported record high Covid 19 hospitalizations on Friday , according to the Covid Tracking Project , and 22 states have reported at least one record high day of coronavirus hospitalizations in November .
