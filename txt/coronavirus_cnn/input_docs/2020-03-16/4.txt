The situation in France is " deteriorating very quickly , " the head of the country 's public health authority said in a radio interview this morning . 
Jerome Salomon said that the coronavirus epidemic was " very quick , " with the number of cases currently doubling " every three days . " 
Salomon did specify that there were relatively few cases concerning children . 
" We can all counter the epidemic by respecting the measures , the barrier measures that French people know but that they â€™re not applying now , " he said . 
French measures : France has closed restaurants , cafes , cinemas and clubs , and issued a ban on large gatherings to contain the spread of the virus . 
More than half of the country 's 300 coronavirus patients in intensive care are under the age of 60 , Salomon said on Saturday . 
There are more than 5,300 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in France , including 127 deaths , according to the World Health Organization .
