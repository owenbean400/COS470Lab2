As the number of coronavirus cases grows globally , many people will be concerned that they or their family members may have caught the disease . 
In most cases , the coronavirus makes people sick , usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness , similar to a common cold . 
Its symptoms include a runny nose , cough , sore throat , headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days . 
For those with a weakened immune system , the elderly and the very young , there 's a chance the virus could cause a lower , and much more serious , respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis . 
If you want to protect yourself , there 's no vaccine yet and may not be for many months . 
In the meantime , you may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick . 
Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze , and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch . 
Avoid touching your eyes , nose and mouth . 
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds . 
Awareness is also key . 
If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be coronavirus , you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early .
