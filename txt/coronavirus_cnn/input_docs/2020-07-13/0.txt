Coronavirus is " clearly the most challenging " public health crisis he ’s ever dealt with – including HIV , Ebola , Anthrax and Zika , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said during a webinar with Stanford School of Medicine on Monday . 
As cases continue to surge across the US and the Trump administration pushes to reopen schools , Fauci has actively continued to warn about the seriousness of the pandemic . 
Fauci told the Wall Street Journal in a podcast last week that the country must control crowds , get people to wear masks and do a better job on physical distancing to get on top of the surging coronavirus pandemic as cases spike across parts of the South and Southwest . 
Fauci noted that in order to get children back in school this fall , the country has to maintain control over the pandemic . 
" We have got to keep our eye on that , " he said .
