The closer you get to northern Italy ’s " red zones " — where inhabitants are barred from leaving and others entering — the less concerned the residents seem to be . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman is in Secugnago , a village in Lombardy about a 5 minute drive from the police road block barring entry into the red zone . 
" We just had a few bottles of white wine and some risotto , " a man said with a laugh as he got on his bicycle in the main square . 
Half the shops and cafes in Secugnago are closed because , locals say , their owners live inside the red zone . 
The rest seem to be operating as usual — although one grocery store has posted a sign outside asking customers to enter only three at a time , wear face masks and shop as quickly as possible . 
But few people in Secugnago are actually wearing masks : A man named Daniele is out on a stroll with his wife and young children . 
Daniele is a technician for a company that installs home alarms , and under normal circumstances would be at work on a Wednesday morning . 
" Look around , " he says . 
" At the closer shops and businesses . 
We will pay a much higher economic price than the Coronavirus itself . "
