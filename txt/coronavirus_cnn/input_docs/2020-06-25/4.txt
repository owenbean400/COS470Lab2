Coronavirus cases are surging in Texas and hospital admissions are significantly increasing . 
" It 's pretty dire , " Dr . Peter Hotez , professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine , told CNN ’s Jake Tapper . 
Hotez said that the state is not seeing increased deaths yet — but they will soon . 
" Those deaths will start to mount up , I would say , in a couple of weeks , " he said . 
Hotez said the projections for Covid 19 cases and deaths in Texas suggest as many as 4,000 cases a day by the Fourth of July weekend just over a week away . 
" So , three or four times even this very high acceleration , a very high rate in Houston and similar things are happening now in Dallas , and all the metro areas , Dallas , Austin , San Antonio , " he said . 
" I ca not stress enough how concerned I am . " 
He said the coronavirus infection pattern of racial disparity seems to be at play in the latest surge in Texas cases . 
" We ’ve seen in Houston and some of the other Texas cities a disproportionate impact on people living in low income neighborhoods where it 's harder to do the social distancing , where there 's higher rates of underlying diabetes and hypertension , " he said . 
" I 'm especially worried at what 's happening to the African American , Hispanic , Latinx populations in Houston . 
We do not have the data yet , but I ’m guessing they are disproportionately being affected like we saw in New Orleans . "
