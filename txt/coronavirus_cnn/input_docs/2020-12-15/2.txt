A man pleaded guilty to defrauding his employer in May by falsely claiming he was infected with Covid 19 , according to statement released by the US Attorney â€™s Office for the Northern District of Georgia on Monday . 
Santwon Antonio Davis , 35 , of Atlanta , falsely claimed to have contracted the virus and submitted a falsified medical record to his employer , the statement reads .

During the Covid 19 fraud investigation , agents uncovered a previous incident in which Davis submitted fraudulent paperwork to obtain bereavement benefits from his employer for the death of his child -- a child that did not exist . 
Additionally , while on pretrial release in the original Covid 19 case against him , Davis submitted a mortgage application with numerous fraudulent statements , including a falsified earnings and employment history , the statement reads .
