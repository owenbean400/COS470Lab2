Coronavirus is " my worst nightmare , " in some ways more than Ebola or HIV , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Tuesday . 
" Ebola was scary , but Ebola would never be easily transmitted , " Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said . 
Ebola outbreaks are also always highly local . 
" HIV , as important as it is , was drawn out and over an extended period of time , " added Fauci , who was speaking via recorded video at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization International Convention . 
Many never felt threatened by the disease because it was always a threat " depending upon who you are , where you are , where you live . " 
In the past , when people would ask Fauci to describe a potential disease that he feared most , he said he would often describe it as something that was a brand new respiratory infection that likely jumped from an animal and had a very high degree of transmissibility . 
The world has seen outbreaks that have at least some of those characteristics , he said , but Covid 19 had all of those characteristics combined . 
" Now we have something that turned out to be my worst nightmare , " Fauci said . 
" In the period of four months , it has devastated the world . "
