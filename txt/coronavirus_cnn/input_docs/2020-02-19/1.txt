If you were hoping for a quick cure for the coronavirus , the World Health Organization has some bad news . 
WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news briefing on Tuesday that a vaccine against the virus was still at least a year away . 
But he said a vaccine would only protect against " the worst situation " of a pandemic , and for now it was important to promote public health solutions to limit the virus 's spread . 
" This is a window of opportunity that should not be missed , " he said . 
US risk from virus ' minimal ' : As health officials around the world work to limit the spread of the coronavirus , an expert told CNN the risk to the US so far is " very minimal . " 
" There really are only 15 cases now , in addition to those who were shipped here . 
They were identified , they were isolated and the contacts were traced . " said Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Fauci said that things could change , and a global pandemic was possible , but for now the situation appeared to be contained .
