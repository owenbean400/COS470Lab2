The Head of Italian Civil Protection Angelo Borelli said 650 people have tested positive for Coronavirus in Italy . 
Referring to the new figures , Borelli said that the sudden raise in numbers was because the Lombardy region did not properly update the Italian Civil Protection Agency . 
" The big jump from yesterday ( Wednesday ) is because yesterday we did not have the latest numbers from Lombardy , " he said . 
The Italian official added that 35,000 masks have been sent to the affected areas . 
Earlier today , the Italian Civil Protection agency said the total number of cases was 528 .
