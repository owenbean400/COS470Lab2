Saudi Arabia has suspended pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina for people outside the country over novel coronavirus fears . 
The kingdom , which bills itself as the custodian of Islam ’s two holiest sites , will open religious rituals to residents and nationals only . 
In recent years , diplomatic rifts in the region restricted travel for pilgrims from Qatar and Iran , prompting an outcry . 
But a wholesale temporary ban on foreign visits to the holy sites is a first in living memory . 
Across the Middle East , governments have been struggling to cope with the spread of Covid 19 . 
Iran , a regional breeding ground for the virus , has canceled this Friday ’s prayers in affected provinces . 
Iraq has closed schools , public offices and other public gatherings until March 7 . 
Kuwait , which has the second largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases after Iran , is also scrambling to stem the spread of the virus , evacuating citizens from Iran and Italy , which has also seen a surge in the virus . 
The majority of Middle Eastern coronavirus cases have come from Iran , one of the biggest outbreak countries outside of China . 
Iran has 141 confirmed cases , and 22 have died from the sickness , according to state media . 
Saudi Arabia , which froze diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 , has no reported cases of the virus . 
In addition to stopping pilgrimages for outsiders , preventative measures include suspending the entry of nationals of " countries with confirmed Coronavirus outbreaks , " according to a tweet by the Saudi foreign ministry . 
" Saudi Arabia stress that these measures are temporary and subject to continuous evaluation by the relevant authorities , " a graphic embedded in the tweet said . 
" We ask God Almighty to spare all humanity from all harm . 
# Corona Virus # COVID19 "
