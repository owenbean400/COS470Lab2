As both the coronavirus and panic related to it continue to spread around the world , so too are bogus claims , conspiracy theories and misinformation about the disease . 
There 's so much inaccurate information floating around out there that the World Health Organization is calling it an " infodemic . " 
So let 's unpack some myths . 
Myth 1 : Coronavirus is man made Reality : Scientists in both China and the West have widely dismissed these theories , though that has not stopped them from spreading . 
Experts are still trying to figure out the exact source of the virus , but research indicates that it likely originated in bats and was transmitted to an intermediate host before jumping to people -- just like its cousin that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic . 
Myth 2 : Home remedies can cure or prevent the virus Reality : There 's currently no cure for the novel coronavirus . 
And while research is underway , it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available . 
The best way to protect yourself right now is to do what you would every cold and flu season . 
Stay at least three feet away from anyone who may be infected . 
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds . 
Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze with your elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately after . 
And disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch . 
If you have symptoms that feel worse than a common cold , seek treatment early .

Face masks should instead be worn by those who have the new coronavirus and are showing symptoms , in order to protect others from being infected .
