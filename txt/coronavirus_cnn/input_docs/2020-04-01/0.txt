President Donald Trump acknowledged Tuesday that Covid 19 is worse than the seasonal flu , despite claiming otherwise multiple times in the past . 
Some context : The tone is new for Trump , who on March 9 tweeted : " So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu . 
It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year . 
Nothing is shut down , life & the economy go on . 
At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of Corona Virus , with 22 deaths . 
Think about that ! " 
Two days after Trump made that comment , Dr . Anthony Fauci warned that coronavirus is " 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu . " 
Today members of the coronavirus task force warned that Americans should be " prepared " for over 100,000 deaths .
