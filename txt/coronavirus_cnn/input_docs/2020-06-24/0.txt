Former United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr . Tom Frieden says the country is not doing enough to keep the Covid 19 pandemic at bay . 
Frieden is currently the CEO of Resolve to Save Lives , an initiative of global public health organization Vital Strategies . 
The uptick in the number of cases in parts of the US are not the result of the country doing more testing , as some Republicans , including President Donald Trump , have argued . 
Instead , the numbers are going up because there is more disease and it is spreading , Frieden said . 
" The US response is just lagging , " Frieden said . 
" We ’re not doing what we need to do to keep physically distant . 
We are not across the country scaling up contact tracing as effectively as needed so we can prevent cases into exploding into clusters and outbreaks . " 
Frieden compared the US ' response to South Korea ’s . 
According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University , South Korea has reported 281 coronavirus deaths while the US has seen more than 121,000 . 
Countries around the world have lower rates of infection because they are better at testing , tracing and isolating people who are sick , Frieden said . 
He believes there needs to be a better national response in the US . 
In the absence of an adequate national response , there is something individuals can do to keep case numbers down , he said . 
" Remember the three W ’s . 
Wear a mask , wash your hands , watch your distance , " Frieden said . 
" You do these three things , we can keep the virus at bay . "
