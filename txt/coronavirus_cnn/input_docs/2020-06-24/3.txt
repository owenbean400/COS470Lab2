Dr . David Blumenthal , president of The Commonwealth Fund , said the coronavirus pandemic in the United States is like watching a " public health train wreck in slow motion . " 
The Commonwealth fund is a foundation that studies health systems . 
Speaking during an Alliance for Health Policy and Commonwealth Fund webinar on Wednesday , Blumenthal said that leaves Americans in a difficult position . 
Dr . Reed Tuckson , managing director of Tuckson Health Connections , said those lessons learned are both good and bad . 
Tuckson said he has seen the value of the health care profession go up , he has seen hospitals become more flexible in their ability to provide care , and the advancement of telehealth has been a " watershed moment in the future in the history of health care . " 
Tuckson , an AHP board chair member , said , sadly , the bad outweighs the good . 
" We do not really have a health system , " he said . 
" So to talk about how the health system performed is probably a non sequitur . " 
Some context : Tuckson said the pandemic has highlighted " the politicization of science and public health , the inability to overcome the legacy of distrust by people of color and other populations , the attacking of public health officials , and the intimidation of them through the politicization . " 
" What is not getting enough attention is the suboptimal capacity of contact tracing . 
And it 's not just the capacity of contact tracing , but the ability to gain the trust of the American people , " Tuckson said . 
" We have failed in our health system to maintain or build those trusting relationships that could have withstood the challenges of the moment , " Tuckson said , adding that the problems were " exacerbated " by political leaders . 
" Unfortunately , we did not have the resiliency built into the system that we should have had , " he added .
