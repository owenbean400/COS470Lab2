There 's still a lot we do not know about the coronavirus , and scientists internationally are racing to gather data and develop a treatment . 
Here 's what we can tell you so far : Is there a cure ? 
Not at the moment . 
Researchers have successfully grown the virus in a lab , an important step towards developing a vaccine -- but it could be a year or more until it 's available . 
What are the symptoms ? 
Coronavirus symptoms can look like the flu -- fever , cough , trouble breathing . 
If you show these symptoms and recently went to China , or have been in contact with someone who visited , experts advise going to the doctor . 
How does the virus spread ? 
The virus is thought to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing -- but it 's not clear exactly when a person becomes contagious . 
There 's currently no evidence that the virus is airborne -- meaning , for instance , it does not travel across a large room . 
Who is at risk of infection ? 
People of all ages can be infected with the virus , but older people and those with pre existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable to severe complications . 
How can I protect myself ? 
Take the same precautionary measures you would during flu season . 
Wash your hands often with soap and water , cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough , avoid close contact with people or large gatherings , and wear a face mask . 
Is it safe to travel ? 
Airlines have suspended flights , and thousands of foreign citizens in China 's Wuhan have been evacuated back to their home countries . 
Many countries including the US have advised against travel to China .
