At least three of the companies working to develop a coronavirus vaccine are putting together an unusual joint pledge promising not to seek approval for their vaccines until they have been proven safe and effective , the Wall Street Journal reported Friday . 
The Wall Street Journal said the pledge would be aimed at calming worries about a rush to approve a vaccine early , before trials have adequately demonstrated whether any experimental immunizations really work . 
The newspaper said it reviewed a draft of the statement that was being finalized by companies that include Pfizer , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson . 
Pfizer and Moderna have vaccines in late stage , Phase 3 clinical trials in the US ; 
Johnson & Johnson is preparing to start one . 
It quoted " two people familiar with the matter " as saying the pledge may be released next week . 
Moderna said in an email to CNN that it had " no comment on any potential outreach , but reaffirms our own commitment to ensuring that safety and efficacy data from our Phase 1 , 2 and 3 trials drive any regulatory decisions regarding use of our COVID 19 vaccine candidate . " 
Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson did not immediately return CNN â€™s requests for comment . 
A spokesperson for Glaxo Smith Kline , which also has a coronavirus vaccine in clinical trials in the US , was unable to confirm reports about a pledge .
