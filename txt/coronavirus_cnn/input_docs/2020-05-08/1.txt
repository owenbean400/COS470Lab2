The novel coronavirus could kill as many as 190,000 people in Africa during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail , the World Health Organization warned on Thursday . 
The WHO predicted that between 29 million to 44 million Africans could be infected in the first year . 
As many as 5.5 million of these people could require hospital treatment , a number that would overwhelm the medical capacity of most places on the continent . 
A survey done in March of health services in Africa found an average of nine intensive care unit beds per 1 million people in 47 African countries . 
" These would be woefully inadequate , " the WHO said .
