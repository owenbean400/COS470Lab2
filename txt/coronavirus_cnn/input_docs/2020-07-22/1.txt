The Australian state of Victoria has suffered another record day of new Coronavirus cases with 484 people diagnosed on Tuesday , according to Daniel Andrews , the state premier . 
Just 97 of the cases detected on Tuesday were linked to known outbreaks , with 387 under investigation . 
Two men in their 90s died on Tuesday , bringing the state ’s death toll to 44 and Australia ’s to 128 . 
The high figure comes despite Melbourne being two weeks into a six week lockdown , with people only allowed to leave their homes for work , to buy food , to get or give care or for exercise . 
Premier Andrews said Wednesday that " insecure workers " are a " big driver " in the uptick in cases because they are going to work when ill . 
Acknowledging that shift workers risk not getting paid if they do not show for work , Andrews announced a $ 1500 hardship payment available to incentivize insecure workers to stay home instead of going to work when ill or while waiting for a test result . 
Masks become mandatory in public places in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire as of Thursday . 
There are 3408 active cases in Victoria , 3305 in metro Melbourne and Mitchell Shire , and 103 in all other regions of Victoria .
