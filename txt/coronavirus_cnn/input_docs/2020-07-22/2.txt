Police dogs in Chile are being trained to detect Covid 19 in humans by sniffing their sweat . 
Chile ’s National Police and the Catholic University of Chile are working on a joint project to train three golden retrievers and a labrador to detect " a new odor " in humans which in this case belong to Covid 19 patients , the university ’s professor and veterinary epidemiologist , Fernando Mardones told CNN 's Spanish language news network , CNN en Español . 
Coronavirus does not have a smell per se , but sweat does and dogs can be trained to detect the smell of a person going through an infection process , Mardones explained . 
" A body that contracts Covid 19 generates volatile organic compounds . 
A sample is taken from a person in the early stages of the infection . 
A gauze is left for about 15 minutes on an individual 's underarm . 
That 's the sample we store and use to train the dogs with , " Mardones explained . 
The " bio detector " dogs , as they are called by the Chilean police , are expected to be trained by mid September and sent to places with high concentrations of people – such as malls , sports centers , bus terminals and airports , according to the Chilean police . 
A dog can smell 250 people in an hour , so they can be deployed when these places reopen , " Julio Santelices from the Chilean police said . 
" Their olfactory capacity is so great that they would be able to detect the disease early on " Santelices said , adding that " this means that an asymptomatic person could be detected by the bio detector dog . " 
The dogs can take from two weeks up to two months to be fully trained . 
The canines are being taught to sit next to the individual with the Covid 19 virus they have detected , instead of " pawing " the individual as they currently do when sniffing drugs , the Chilean police told CNN .
