The standard for authorizing any eventual coronavirus vaccine will be like an " emergency use authorization plus , " a top US Food and Drug Administration official said Thursday . 
FDA requirements will be stricter than for an emergency use authorization for an experimental drug , said Dr . Peter Marks , who heads FDA ’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research . 
But it will not be as stringent as the requirements for full licensure . 
Vaccines are not licensed as drugs , but rather as biologics under a Biologics License Application or BLA . 
Emergency use authorization is a " relatively low bar , " Marks said . 
" It ’s a product that may be effective , " he added . 
A BLA requires substantial data from controlled clinical trials showing the product is effective . 
" Along that spectrum it is going to be closer to the BLA , even though that is not going to be exactly identical , " Marks said . 
Usually , a full license requires details about how a product would be manufactured , along with extensive safety data from months of follow up . 
" But the substantial information about efficacy and the most important information regarding safety will be there , " Marks said .
