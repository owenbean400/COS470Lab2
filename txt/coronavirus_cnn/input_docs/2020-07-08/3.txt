US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams has called wearing a mask or face covering " the most important thing " that people can do right now to allow the nation to open and stay open . 
" We have the ability to slow the spread of Covid if we wear face coverings . 
It 's the most important thing in my opinion that we can do that will allow us to open and stay open , " Adams told the local news station FOX 5 in Washington , DC , on Wednesday morning . 
" Coronavirus can get bad really quickly , but I want people to understand that we can improve the coronavirus rates really quickly in the course of two to three weeks , " Adams said . 
" There are studies that show that you can decrease the spread of coronavirus by 60 % , 70 % if you can get 80 plus % of people wearing face coverings when they go out in public . " 
Yet Adams added that he still does not support a nationwide mandate for face coverings â€” he said that someone has to explain how such a mandate would " actually function " and he worries about " over policing . " 
" I support local and state mask mandates if governors and mayors want to do that , but I think we have to help educate people . 
We 've got to make sure the enforcement mechanism is something that 's not going to be overly onerous . 
People are more likely to cooperate if they know why they 're doing that and if they actually know how they 're going to benefit , " Adams said . 
" I 'd rather help educate you and have you choose to do it than to force people to do it . "
