Coronavirus is in retreat across the United Kingdom , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday . 
He said the government 's scientific advisers estimate the virus reproductive rate is currently below one in all regions . 
However , Hancock warned that where there are individual " flare ups and outbreaks " the government will take local action . 
" The epidemic in care homes is coming under control ... the latest figures shows an almost 50 % fall in the number of new care homes reporting an outbreak , " Hancock said . 
No Covid 19 related deaths were recorded in London hospitals or across Scotland on Sunday , he said . 
However , although Sunday 's official UK death toll of 55 was the lowest daily rise since lockdown began on March 23 , the figures do tend to be lower at weekends because of delays in reporting , Hancock cautioned .
