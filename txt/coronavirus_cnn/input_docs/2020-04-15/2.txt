The United Kingdom believes the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has an " important role " to play in leading the global response to the coronavirus outbreak , the prime minister ’s official spokesperson said , adding there are no plans to withdraw funding . 
The comments put the UK at odds with President Trump , who has criticized the WHO ’s response and announced a suspension of funding . 
" Coronavirus is a global challenge and it is essential countries work together to tackle this shared threat , the spokesperson added . 
" In terms of how we contribute to the WHO , that is an assessment of the WHO ’s needs and is not based on other country ’s funding . " 
Some context : Earlier this week , the UK announced it would boost its contribution to the WHO by £ 65 million ( $ 81 million ) . 
The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab , who is filling in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson , will participate in a G7 leaders conference call on Thursday . 
According to the prime minister 's spokesperson , Raab will underline the need for " global collaboration " to deal with the crisis , including the speed and scale of a vaccine and testing internationally . 
" We will also discuss economic concerns and how to support struggling nations , " the spokesperson said .
