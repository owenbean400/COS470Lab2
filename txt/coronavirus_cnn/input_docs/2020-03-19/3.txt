The coronavirus is impacting US military operations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan as measures to prevent its spread have led to major changes in both theaters . 
In Iraq , the US led training effort aimed at combating ISIS has been suspended " for 60 days as a precaution due to the global pandemic , " the United Kingdom Defense Ministry announced Thursday . 
The UK , one of the larger contributors to the coalition in Iraq , also said that it would be returning some of its personnel back to the UK due to the pause . 
Similarly , the US led international coalition in Afghanistan has implemented a series of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus , including " temporarily " pausing the movement of personnel movement into Afghanistan and delaying the return of some service members . 
Such actions could complicate US plans to drawdown its forces level in Afghanistan to 8,600 , a key aspect of the US Taliban agreement that was signed late last month . 
Some more background : US Army Col . Sonny Leggett , a spokesperson for US Forces Afghanistan , said in a tweet Wednesday that while the command was instituting screening and testing protocols to reduce the risk to personnel , he added that " we continue to execute the ordered drawdown to 8,600 .
