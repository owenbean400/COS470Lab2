There have been more than 22,000 excess deaths among care home residents in England and Wales as a direct or indirect result of the coronavirus pandemic , according to a new report from London School of Economics ( LSE ) academics . 
This is more than double official figures for Covid 19 deaths among care home residents . 
The study , published on Tuesday by two academics at LSE ’s Care Policy and Evaluation Centre , found that by May 1 there had been " in excess of 22,000 deaths of care home residents during the COVID 19 pandemic " in England and Wales , which is 54 % of all excess deaths . 
This calculation was based on the total excess mortality in care homes of 19,038 , and adjusted by 15 % , based on an assumption from Care Quality Commission data that 15 % of all deaths of care home residents are found to happen in hospitals . 
The study found official data on deaths in care homes directly attributed to coronavirus underestimates the impact of the pandemic , as it does " not take account of indirect mortality effects of the pandemic and/or because of problems with the identification of the disease as the cause of death " . 
The UK ’s Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday that 8,314 deaths involving Covid 19 had taken place in care homes up to May 8 in England alone . 
On May 8 , UK Department of Health figures reported there had been 31,241 total deaths from coronavirus in hospitals in the UK . 
The Office for National Statistics noted that deaths among care home residents was in recent days becoming a larger proportion of total deaths , with 40 % of coronavirus deaths occurring in care homes in the " most recent days " up to Tuesday .
