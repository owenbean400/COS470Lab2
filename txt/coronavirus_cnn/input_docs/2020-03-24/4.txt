New York state is soaring in coronavirus case numbers , higher and faster than anywhere in America , with more than 25,000 cases and at least 210 deaths by Tuesday — and case totals are doubling every few days . 
But in recent days , numbers in Louisiana , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Florida and Georgia are also spiking fast , according to CNN 's state by state county of positive Covid 19 cases reported by state and local health departments . 
Here 's where things stand now : Michigan rose from just 65 cases about week ago to 1,328 on Tuesday afternoon , including 15 deaths . 
Louisiana , which reported no cases until mid March , topped the 1,000 mark and has seen more than 500 new cases reported just since the weekend , with 1,388 cases and 46 deaths by Tuesday afternoon . 
Pennsylvania saw a spike of more than 200 cases overnight , bringing the total to 851 cases statewide on Tuesday . 
Of those cases , seven people have died . 
Florida and Georgia — two states where leaders have faced criticism for being slow to enact restrictions — both crossed the 1,000 case threshold over the weekend and continue to rise in cases at a rate of at least 20 % each day . 
As of Tuesday afternoon , Florida recorded 1,324 cases and 17 deaths , while Georgia reported 1,026 cases and 32 fatalities . 
Indiana went from a handful of cases about a week ago to 365 Tuesday afternoon . 
Remember : To be sure , while these are notable recent spikes , the states with the consistently largest total number of cases are New York , Washington , and California . 
It ’s just that in recent days , the rates of increase in Washington and California are not quite as high . 
Washington and California were also home to the nation ’s earliest recorded outbreaks .
