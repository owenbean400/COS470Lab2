The number of coronavirus cases are rising but the increases are slower than compared to what happened in the last week , said Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana during a news conference today . 
" It seems that a much more limited growth trend has stabilized " compared to a few days ago , Fontana added . 
This could " hopefully mean that we are going towards a decrease ( of cases ) in the next few days " , Fontana said . 
Fontana also said that Guido Bertolaso , advisor of the Lombardy region for the coronavirus emergency , had tested positive for coronavirus and is self isolating at home . 
" He gave me his availability to carry on working for the realization of the hospital remotely " , Fontana said .
