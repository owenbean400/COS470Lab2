Coronavirus cases are on the rise in 31 states , according to CNN tracking data , and Dr . Anthony Fauci says the country has to " turn this around . " 
" I think we ’re facing a whole lot of trouble , " Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said in an interview on CNBC Monday . 
New coronavirus infections are numbering between 40,000 and 50,000 a day in the US . 
" That 's a bad place to be when you 're going into the cooler weather of the fall and the colder weather of the winter , " Fauci said . 
The increase in the percentage of people testing positive for the virus is also going in the wrong direction , said Fauci , who is a member of the White House coronavirus task force . 
" So you combine an increase in test positivity , which is always a predictor of more cases , and ultimately more hospitalizations , and ultimately more deaths , and you combine that with a baseline of 40 , 45 , 50,000 new cases a day as you go into a weather system where you 're going to be spending more time indoors rather than outdoors , which is a perfect setup for an acceleration of respiratory borne diseases — that is unquestionably a problem , " he said . 
" So that 's the concern that I have and so many of my fellow public health officials have , " Fauci added .
