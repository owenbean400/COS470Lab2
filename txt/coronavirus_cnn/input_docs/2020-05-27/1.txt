England will launch a " test and trace " system to track coronavirus aimed at replacing national lockdown restrictions . 
Northern Ireland has already launched a contact tracing program , and Scotland and Wales are in the process of launching similar system , he said . 
England 's contact tracing program will ask anyone with coronavirus symptoms to isolate immediately , get a coronavirus test , and speak with the UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) on a voluntary basis . 
Those who test positive for Covid 19 will be contacted by the NHS within 24 hours . 
" This will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing . 
But we can quickly make it mandatory if that ’s what it takes . 
Because if we do not make this work , then the only way forward is to keep the lockdown , " Hancock said . 
He also announced that England is expanding coronavirus testing to children under five years old . 
" Of course testing capacity is critical to making this work . 
We now have the capacity for 161,000 tests a day , " Hancock said . 
" We are expanding eligibility for testing to include the ‘ under fives ’ so now every single person who has symptoms of coronavirus can get a test no matter their age . " 
" To protect your friends and your family , testing and tracing must become a new way of life , " he said .
