The first known Covid 19 cases have been confirmed in Bangladesh 's refugee camps in Cox 's Bazar , the United Nations said on Thursday , citing the Bangladeshi government . 
The camps at Cox 's Bazar are home to nearly a million Rohingya refugees , many of whom fled across the border to Bangladesh to escape violence in neighboring Myanmar . 
One of the confirmed cases was a Rohingya refugee , and the other was a Bangladeshi citizen who lives in the surrounding area of the camps , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) said in a statement . 
Bangladesh currently has at least 18,863 confirmed cases of coronavirus , with 283 deaths , a tally from Johns Hopkins University shows . 
Government response : The Bangladeshi government suspended most of the services within the densely populated camps in late March , including educational programs and other advocacy work . 
Health officials have now begun to treat both patients while isolating and testing other refugees in the camps , the agency said . 
Covid in the camps is " a nightmare " : " The first positive case of Covid 19 in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh is the realization of a nightmare scenario , " said Daniel P . Sullivan , a senior advocate for human rights with the US based organization Refugees International . 
Sullivan also stressed the importance of the Bangladeshi government â€™s efforts to ensure open communication as well as more medical resources within the refugee camp to prevent and prepare for further spread . 
CNN has reached out to the Bangladeshi government for a comment .
