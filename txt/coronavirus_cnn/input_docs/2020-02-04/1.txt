There 's still a lot we do not know about the Wuhan coronavirus , and scientists around the world are racing to gather data and develop a treatment . 
Here 's what we can tell you so far : Is there a cure ? 
No -- but there are signs of progress . 
Thai doctors say they have successfully treated two patients with a combination of antiviral drugs . 
What are the symptoms ? 
Coronavirus symptoms can look like the flu -- fever , cough , trouble breathing . 
If you have these symptoms and have recently been to China , or have been in contact with someone who has , experts advise you to see a doctor . 
How does the virus spread ? 
The virus is thought to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing . 
There 's also a possibility the virus can exist in and spread through contaminated fecal matter . 
There 's currently no evidence that the virus is airborne -- meaning , for instance , it does not travel across a large room . 
Who is at risk of infection ? 
People of all ages can be infected with the virus , but older people and those with pre existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable to severe complications . 
On Tuesday , China â€™s National Health Commission said that of the 425 confirmed deaths across mainland China , 80 % of victims were over the age of 60 , and 75 % of victims had some form of underlying condition . 
How can I protect myself ? 
Take the same precautionary measures you would during flu season : Wash your hands often with soap and water , cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough , avoid close contact with people or large gatherings , and wear a face mask . 
Is it safe to travel ? 
Airlines have suspended flights , and thousands of foreign citizens in the Chinese city of Wuhan have been evacuated back to their home countries . 
Many countries , including the US , have advised against travel to China , while some countries , including the UK , are advising their citizens to leave China .
