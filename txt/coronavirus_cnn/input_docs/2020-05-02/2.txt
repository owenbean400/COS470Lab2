Russia reported 9,623 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday in its biggest spike to date , according to the country ’s coronavirus response center . 
The total number of officially reported cases is 124,054 , with 1,222 deaths . 
Moscow , the country ’s worst hit city , has also seen a record spike after a few days of relatively steady growth , adding more than 5,000 cases in a day . 
For weeks , Russian independent media and non governmental organizations have reported anonymous pleas from outraged medical workers who said they had been ordered to the frontlines of a public health crisis without adequate protection , and that bureaucratic foot dragging was costing lives . 
As the situation worsens and case numbers surpass those reported from Iran and China , many have become more outspoken , sometimes risking legal action against them .
