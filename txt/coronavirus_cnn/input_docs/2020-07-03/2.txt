England is trying to walk a " narrow path " between health and economic dangers of coronavirus , England 's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Friday . 
" Go too far one side , and the virus comes back again . 
Go too far on the other side , and we get even further — and this is a medical point — increases in unemployment , depravation increasing , and all the social ills that go with that , " Witty said . 
" So either side of the path we ’re on , there are risks . 
We ’re going to have health problems , and we ’re going to have economic problems for sure , " he said . 
Witty also said that the virus was " a long way from gone " and was not going to be gone " for a very , very long time . " 
Reopening pubs and restaurants in England is not a " risk free " step , he said . 
Bars and restaurants are set to reopen tomorrow . 
Whitty said everyone wants to support businesses , but at the same time it is important to be " really disciplined " in observing all the regulations that make it " less easy for the virus to come back again . "
