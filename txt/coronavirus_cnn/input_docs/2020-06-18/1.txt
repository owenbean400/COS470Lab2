Louisiana Gov . 
John Bel Edwards said in a news conference on Thursday the state added 4,200 Covid 19 cases in seven days . 
" Since June 10 , we 've added more than 4,200 new Covid 19 cases across the state , that is in seven days , " he said . 
" Most of these new cases did not come from nursing homes or other congregate settings . 
And what that means is they were the result of community spread . " 
The governor said he wanted to share this information as there is a lot of talk in the state and nationally about a second wave in the fall . 
" Today , we did not know we 're still very much in the first wave . 
Coronavirus has not left . 
It is still very much here with us , and it is present in every community across the state of Louisiana , " he said . 
Asked if he thought about making masks mandatory as some other states have , Edwards said , " I am not going to tell you that we have not thought about it . 
But at the end of the day , those states that went there quickly reversed course . 
It is just not something that you can enforce . 
And I think you end up doing more harm than good by trying to make it mandatory . " 
Here are the numbers : There are at least 48,634 cases of Covid 19 in the state , and at least 2,950 people have died .
