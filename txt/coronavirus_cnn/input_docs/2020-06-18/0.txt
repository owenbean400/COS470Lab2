The coronavirus pandemic could set back some HIV preventions 10 years , Winnie Byanyima , executive director of The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , said during a Thursday briefing . 
Byanyima said if countries continue to face financial pressure and drop important HIV health services in order to fight the coronavirus pandemic , it could be catastrophic . 
" We 've estimated that within six months , we could have additional deaths , AIDS related deaths , of up to half a million — on top of what we have already , " she continued . 
" So there is a need to keep both to get the fight against both epidemics , going at the same time , " Byanyima added . 
" Coronavirus has found Africa weak health wise and weak economically , " she said . 
" We have the highest burden of HIV in the whole world . 
And also , highest burden or other diseases as well . " 
" Africa has a difficult situation . 
And this is not to mention locusts , floods , landslides , droughts — that have also been hitting us as we fight the coronavirus , " she said .
