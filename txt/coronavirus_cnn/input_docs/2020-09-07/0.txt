President Trump is again claiming , without evidence , that he is " starting to get VERY high marks " in the " handling of the Coronavirus . " 
It is unclear what source Trump is using to make the erroneous claim but follows a pattern of Trump â€™s desperation to stamp an end date on the deadly pandemic before November 3 . 
Some context : According to a new CBS News/You Gov poll , only 21 % of voters nationwide said they would immediately seek out a vaccine if one was made available in 2020 . 
That number is down from 32 % in July . 
65 % said they believed a vaccine announced this year would , by definition , be the product of a " rushed " process . 
Only 35 % would regard it positively , as a " scientific achievement . " 
Trump announced on Twitter this morning that he 'll be holding a news conference later today .
