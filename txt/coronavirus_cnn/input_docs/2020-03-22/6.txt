The Detroit Metro Times started the year on a celebratory note , having reached its 40th anniversary . 
This week , its staff was slashed from 16 to eight employees after its parent company Euclid Media Group announced layoffs across its seven newspapers as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the country , crippling businesses in its wake . 
Music editor Jerilyn Jordan was told in a conference call on Wednesday that she was one of the remaining employees but staying on would mean a 10 % pay cut . 
With local events canceled and restaurants and bars shuttering to crack down on the gathering of large crowds , local newsrooms have not only had to change their coverage . 
They have also lost out on crucial ad revenue and places to distribute their print products . 
These changes have an outsized effect on alt weeklies which rely heavily on advertising from events and local businesses . 
" I think I 'm a fairly good salesperson , but to be able to convince someone to run an ad for an event they 're not having is beyond my capabilities , " Jeff von Kaenel , president , CEO and majority owner of the News & Review newspapers in Sacramento , Chico and Reno told CNN Business . 
" Now businesses where I normally distribute papers are closed so it 's not going to work . 
There was essentially no revenue stream and no effective way to get out the paper . "
