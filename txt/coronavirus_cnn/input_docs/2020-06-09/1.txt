Coronavirus is " my worst nightmare , " worse in ways than Ebola or HIV , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Tuesday . 
" Ebola was scary , but Ebola would never be easily transmitted , " Fauci said speaking at the BIO International Convention . 
" HIV , as important as it is , was drawn out and over an extended period of time , " added Fauci , who is also a top member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force . 
Many never felt threatened by the disease because it was always a threat " depending upon who you are , where you are , where you live . " 
In the past , when people would ask Fauci to describe a disease that would be his worst nightmare , he said he would often describe it as something that was a brand new respiratory infection that likely jumped from an animal , and had a very high degree of transmissibility . 
The world has seen outbreaks that have at least some of those characteristics , he said , but Covid 19 had all of those characteristics combined . 
Condensed into a short amount of time , the pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands in the US alone , and there are many millions of infections worldwide . 
It was " unexpected how rapidly , " it would spread , " he said . 
" It just took over the planet , " Fauci said . 
" And it is not over yet . "
