Juliana Morawski was an emergency room nurse for 30 years before retiring . 
But once the coronavirus outbreak broke out , she said she felt compelled to come out of retirement to assist in any way she could . 
Morawski said most health care workers are simply doing their jobs , even though there ’s a huge amount of stress in some areas , trying to treat as many patients as possible . 
" Everybody lionizes the emergency responders and first responders as essential workers … but we 're not martyrs . 
And I think it 's very difficult for those of us who have worked this many years to actually … feel threat from our own environment also , " she said . 
Morawski said that right now she ’s answering phones for the Department of Health , but she ’s eager to get into the ER once the coronavirus peak happens in the Chicago area . 
" I want to be in the thick of it , " she said . 
She said she ’s concerned about coronavirus , but is not letting that stop her . 
" I do not want to have worry or fear rule my life , so I ’m cautious but not worried , " she said .
