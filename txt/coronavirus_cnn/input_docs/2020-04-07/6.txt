Numbers show a disproportionate number of black Americans are dying due to the coronavirus , doctors and officials say . 
Dr . Camara Phyllis Jones , a family physician and epidemiologist , said structural segregation and inequality in US society has positioned black Americans and other minorities to be more exposed to the virus , and have more severe cases because of other health issues . 
She said this same segregation also means that black people work jobs that are seen as less valuable , and as a result , they are not as protected . 
Phyllis Jones pointed out another reason cases are resulting in death could be the limited access to health care."What 's happening is black folks are getting infected more because they are exposed more and once infected they 're dying more , " she said . 
Here 's a look at some of the numbers : Louisiana Gov .
