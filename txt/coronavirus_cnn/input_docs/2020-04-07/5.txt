David Lat spent 17 days hospitalized with Covid 19 , including six days on a ventilator before being discharged last week . 
" It was like a scene out of ‘ ER ’ or ‘ Chicago Hope ’ or something . 
But I have no recollection of my time on the ventilator , which is interesting because I 've since read that some ventilator patients have hallucinations , delusions . 
I do not remember anything , " said Lat , a lawyer and legal writer whose tweets during his time in the hospital were shared widely on social media . 
While he was in good health , did not smoke and has run two New York City marathons , he told CNN ’s Alisyn Camerota he did experience exercise induced asthma . 
" There probably are a lot of people out there who have conditions that are similar that do not make a big impact on their day to day lives , but they should be aware of because if you get coronavirus or Covid 19 , it can make things a lot worse for you , " he said . 
He said he was treated with a few different drugs , including hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax , but doctors were unable to tell him definitely if they helped him recover .
