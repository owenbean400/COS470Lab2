As the novel coronavirus spreads in the United States , the nation 's response to the outbreak has moved from a containment phase to a mitigation phase , US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams told CNN 's Jake Tapper on " State of the Union " today . 
When Tapper asked Adams about some top White House officials claiming the virus has been contained , Adams said , " Well , this is a novel virus . 
It ’s a new situation and the messaging , quite frankly , is hard . " 
" The first thing you want to try to do is contain the virus — and some parts of the country have contained it , meaning they ’re preventing spread into their communities in the first place , " Adams said . 
" Once you know it ’s in your community , you want to take the steps to prevent spread within the community and to keep those most at risk safe . "
