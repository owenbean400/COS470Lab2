A recent scientific article suggested that the novel coronavirus responsible for the Covid 19 epidemic has mutated into a more " aggressive " form . 
Is this something we need to worry about ? 
No , and here 's why . 
Mutations are normal : The first claim that the coronavirus is mutating is true , and it 's fine ! 
The effects of mutation in real life are nuanced and generally innocuous . 
Using the idea of mutation to incite fear is harmful , especially in the midst of an epidemic like Covid 19 . 
A particularly fraught question during epidemics is whether the causative pathogen will mutate to become more dangerous . 
This is the wrong question . 
Mutation is a mundane aspect of existence for many viruses , and the novel coronavirus is no exception . 
RNA and DNA : The genetic material of the virus is RNA , not DNA like in humans . 
Unlike with human DNA , when viruses copy their genetic material , it does not proofread its work . 
Because RNA viruses essentially operate without a spell check , they often make mistakes . 
These " mistakes " are mutations , and viruses mutate rapidly compared to other organisms . 
Instead of fearing unlikely outcomes , we should focus on developing an effective response to the Covid 19 epidemic .
