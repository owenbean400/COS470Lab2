Coronavirus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months to two years -- until 60 % to 70 % of the population worldwide has been infected , a team of longstanding pandemic experts predicted Thursday in a new report . 
They recommended that the United States prepare for a worst case scenario that includes a second big wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter . 
Even in a best case scenario , people will continue to die from the virus , they predicted . 
Osterholm has been writing about the risk of pandemics for 20 years and has advised several presidents . 
Because Covid 19 is new , no one has any immunity , the report said . 
" The length of the pandemic will likely be 18 to 24 months , as herd immunity gradually develops in the human population . "
