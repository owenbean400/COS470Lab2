A vaccine for the novel coronavirus could take 12 to 18 months to develop , according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general for the World Health Organization . 
But a vaccine is preparing for " the worst situation , " he said , and for now , long term preparation needs to be balanced with immediate public health solutions that contain the virus and keep the fatality rate low . 
" This is a window of opportunity that should not be missed , " Tedros said Tuesday during a press briefing . 
Dr . Sylvie Briand , director of WHO 's Infectious Hazards Management Department , said there could be a candidate for a coronavirus vaccine in about 16 weeks , but it would still require months of development and trials to prove its effectiveness in humans . 
Briand said there ’s been no new data on vaccine development since WHO ’s coronavirus research meeting earlier this month . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , WHO executive director of Health Emergencies Programme , said many lives can be saved in the coming months even without a vaccine , so immediate investment is needed to support health systems and provide treatment .
