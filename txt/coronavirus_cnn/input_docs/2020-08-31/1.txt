Emergency physician Dr . Leana Wen says authorizing a vaccine before phase 3 clinical trials are complete is a " slippery slope . " 
This comes in response to US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn ’s comments that that very scenario could be possible . 
" We initially heard Dr . Hahn saying we need to wait until all the trials are in , " Wen said . 
" Then we heard him say , well maybe we can do emergency use authorization right after Phase 3 , and now we 're hearing that we do not even need to wait until Phase 3 trials are complete . " 
Wen expressed concerns that this could undermine the public ’s confidence in a vaccine , or result in a vaccine that is ineffective . 
" The last thing that we want to do is to give a false reassurance to the American people – giving them a vaccine that does not actually protect them against coronavirus , " she said .
