In a wide ranging interview published Sunday , America ’s top infectious disease expert tempered expectations for a return to normalcy , offered advice to people who are protesting in the wake of George Floyd ’s death , and suggested that US travel bans may remain in effect for months . 
Coronavirus could " go on for a couple of cycles , coming back and forth , " Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told British newspaper The Telegraph . 
Amid protests for racial justice , Fauci said the " bottom line is there is a risk ( in protesting ) , and of course it 's concerning . " 
He said that wearing masks helps , but emphasized that crowds are risky . 
Fauci also poured cold water on the idea that limits on travel from the UK and other countries would be lifted in time for the summer holidays . 
School openings should be based on local conditions , Fauci said in the interview . 
He also expressed optimism that a vaccine will ultimately be successful . 
" We have potential vaccines making significant progress . 
We have maybe four or five , " he said . 
" You can never guarantee success with a vaccine , that 's foolish to do so , there 's so many possibilities of things going wrong . ( But ) everything we have seen from early results , it 's conceivable we get two or three vaccines that are successful . "
