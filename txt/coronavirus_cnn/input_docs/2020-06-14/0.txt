Across the world , families who were on the brink of adopting a child have had their futures together postponed by the coronavirus pandemic . 
Adoption systems in many countries have been hit hard . 
Social distancing restrictions have meant the closure of courtrooms and clinics , while travel bans have made connecting with a surrogate or transferring a child between households far more difficult . 
Most international adoptions have been put on hold after countries closed their borders and canceled visa applications , according to agencies who spoke to CNN . 
Dwight Burton and Monik Kadarmanto , who live near Portland , in the US state of Oregon , began the adoption process in September 2018 , and were matched with a three year old boy living at an orphanage in China just before Christmas . 
The couple applied to US immigration in early January for final approval to fly to Changchun , in Jilin province , northeast China .
