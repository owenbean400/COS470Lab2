Coronavirus cases in Italy rose by 21,273 on Sunday , according to Health Ministry figures , a new daily high for the country since the start of the pandemic . 
A total of more than 525,000 cases have now been confirmed in the country . 
On Sunday , a further 128 people died from the virus , bringing Italy 's total death toll to 37,338 . 
There are now 1,208 people with Covid 19 in Italy 's intensive care units . 
The new figures come as Italy ’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte acknowledged during a news conference announcing new restrictions that the " epidemic curve is rapidly increasing " in Italy . 
But Conte said he wanted to avoid a nationwide lockdown like the one he imposed in March , because " the country could not afford it . " 
Italy imposes new measures : New coronavirus restrictions are set to come into force in Italy on Monday . 
Unlike the country ’s national lockdown in March , not all economic and production activities are obliged to close under the new decree . 
The main restrictions concern bars and restaurants and other food services . 
They must close at 6 p.m . local time and have no more than four customers per table . 
Gyms , swimming pools , theaters , cinemas , concert halls , bingo halls , casinos and beauty centers all must close . 
Kindergartens and primary schools will stay open but to avoid overcrowded public transport , high schools must hold 75 % of lessons remotely .
