Coronavirus is a serious situation and deserves your vigilance and attention -- but the deluge of information , precautions and warnings can take a real toll on your mental health . 
Here are some tips on maintaining a happy medium : Pare down your sources of information .

Limit the frequency of your updates , be disciplined with your social media use and know when to walk away .

If your fears are practical ones , think about a plan : What are other options if you ca not telework ? 
Do you have savings or support ? 
Being prepared for your fears will help keep them in scale .

Pay attention to your basic needs . 
Do not forget the essential , healthy practices that affect your wellbeing every day -- getting enough sleep , proper nutrition , physical activity , and getting outside as much as possible .
