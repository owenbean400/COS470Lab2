Coronavirus has infected about 10 % of the world ’s population , Dr . Mike Ryan , director of the World Health Organization ’s Health Emergencies Program , said Monday . 
It varies from region to region , Ryan said at a WHO Executive Board meeting . 
" This varies depending on country , it varies from urban to rural , it varies between different groups . 
But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world remains at risk , " Ryan added . 
According to Johns Hopkins University , more than 35.3 million people have been diagnosed with coronavirus globally , but WHO and other experts say that is almost certainly an enormous undercount . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cases in the US are also undercounted by at least 90 % . 
With a global population of about 7.7 billion people , Ryan ’s estimate would mean about 770 million have been infected -- but most have not been diagnosed or counted .
