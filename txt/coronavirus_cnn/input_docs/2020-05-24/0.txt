Rising levels of coronavirus in sewage can forewarn an outbreak before other metrics such as hospital admissions and case counts , according to a study published Friday . 
That means sewage could be an effective way of tracking the virus , especially when coronavirus tests are in short supply , researchers said . 
Coronavirus has been found in the stool of Covid 19 patients . 
In the study , which has not yet been peer reviewed , researchers compared levels of the virus in " primary sludge samples " to hospital and test data . 
Testing sewage to track outbreaks has been done for other diseases . 
Places in the US are also considering testing wastewater . 
Earlier this week , Honolulu said it plans to check 1,000 samples from its main sewage plant . 
Mayor Kirk Caldwell said the testing would give officials an early indication of whether infections are on the rise . 
" It shows trend lines , and it alerts people — in our case , the city and county of Honolulu — whether we have a problem , " Caldwell said Tuesday .
