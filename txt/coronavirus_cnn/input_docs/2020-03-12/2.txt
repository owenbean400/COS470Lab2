Testing is the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or coronavirus . 
But there have been problems with coronavirus testing â€” from faulty test kits to major shortages and delays in getting tested . 
The flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms , such as fever and cough , but shortness of breath is a common hallmark of coronavirus . 
Of course , some people with coronavirus have no symptoms at all . 
And asymptomatic people can still spread coronavirus to others . 
So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . 
Anyone who recently traveled to a part of the world where coronavirus is widespread should do the same .
