The United Nation 's World Food Programme ( WFP ) estimates 13.7 million people could experience severe food insecurity due to the effects of coronavirus this year . 
As job availability and economies decline , the WFP estimates the amount of people currently experiencing food insecurity - 3.4 million - could quadruple in 2020 . 
Migrants are particularly at risk , the WFP says . 
In Colombia , Ecuador and Peru severe food insecurity among extremely vulnerable Venezuelan migrants could jump from 540,000 to more than 1 million . 
The WFP also says children not receiving their provided lunches due to school closures and the approaching hurricane season could also have an affect on the amount of people who go hungry .
