Connecticut has seen a notable increase in coronavirus rates among 10 to 19 year olds , Gov . 
Ned Lamont said at a news conference on Thursday . 
He said the rates have " doubled . " 
Lamont blamed the spike on kids drinking and partying , and cited the potential risks to other families and teachers , if or when kids return to school . 
He went on to say that parents need to make sure their children are following safe protocols . 
" The power of shame is greater than anything I can do by edict or punishment , " the governor said . 
On schools : Lamont also said he is leaving it up to school districts to determine what they want to do with respect to in person or hybridized learning , with a likely emphasis on more in person schooling for younger kids . 
Any school or district that wishes to opt out of any in person schooling will have to present its case before the education commissioner , he said . 
Lamont said there have been at least six new deaths since the last update and approximately 13 new hospitalizations .
