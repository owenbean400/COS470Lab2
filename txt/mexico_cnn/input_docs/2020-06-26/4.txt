Gov . 
Gavin Newsom has advised Imperial County ’s health officials to reinstate its stay at home order , he announced in a news conference . 
Imperial County has a coronavirus positivity rate of 23 % , with a case rate of 680 in the past week . 
The population of Imperial County is approximately 181,000 . 
These rates are well above state thresholds , said Sonia Angell , the state 's health director . 
The state guidelines are a case rate of 100 and a positivity rate of 10 % . 
More than 500 patients have been transferred out of Imperial County in the past five weeks , the governor said , and reinforcements from the state , including 44 National Guard members , have been sent in to assist . 
More details : Imperial County lies just east of San Diego along the borders of Arizona and Mexico . 
Some drivers of the uptick include US citizens returning to the states to seek health care , the California Department of Public Health said earlier this week . 
The governor said " it ’s too early to tell " if the high number of cases in Arizona are a contributing factor to increases in Imperial County , but a " deep dive " study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is underway to look at that data . 
Imperial is one of 15 counties under what Newsom calls a " watch list " as concerns mount in the state .
