Domestic violence calls have gone up in several regions in the Americas , according to the Pan American Health Organization . 
" The ongoing stay at home measures , coupled with the social and economic impacts of this virus are increasing the risks of domestic violence , " Pan American Health Organization director Dr . Carissa Etienne said in a briefing Tuesday . 
" Home , is no longer a safe space for many . " 
In Argentina , domestic violence calls have increased by more than a third , Etienne said . 
And in Mexico , calls have gone up more than 50 % in comparison to last year . 
Etienne warned this may not even represent the full picture . 
" Violence is never acceptable and survivors of domestic violence , should not be blamed , " Etienne urged .
