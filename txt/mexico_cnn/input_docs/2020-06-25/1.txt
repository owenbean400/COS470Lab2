A set of premature triplets born in Mexico are " stable " and " evolving favorably " after testing positive for Covid 19 , according to local health officials . 
The triplets were born in the central Mexican state of San Luis Potos√≠ and tested for coronavirus on June 17 in compliance with the state 's health protocols on premature births , according to the state 's Health Secretary Monica Rangel . 
The test results came back positive three days later , heath authorities said . 
The parents of the triplets both tested negative for coronavirus , according to Rangel . 
She said they have been able to see their newborn babies through video calls . 
" What we need to look at is a situation where perhaps ( the virus ) is being transmitted through the placenta .

It 's a new virus . 
There still is not literature available internationally on this issue , but it will be worth reviewing , " Rangel said .
