Vaccine maker Novavax has completed enrollment of the Phase 3 trial for its Covid 19 vaccine in the UK , and a large scale clinical trial in the United States and Mexico will begin " in the coming weeks , " the company announced Monday . 
The UK trial enrolled 15,000 participants , and will determine the efficacy and safety of Novavax ’s experimental vaccine , called NVX Co V2373 . 
Interim results from that Phase 3 trial are expected " as soon as early first quarter 2021 , " depending on how fast Covid 19 is spreading in the region , the company said . 
Novavax also announced it has fully enrolled its Phase 2b vaccine trial in South Africa , with more than 4,400 participants . 
Among its trials , more than 20,000 participants have been dosed to date . 
The Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and Mexico will begin " in the coming weeks " -- later than it had previously suggested . 
The vaccine maker said earlier in November that this trial would likely begin by the end of the month . 
It would be the fifth coronavirus vaccine to enter late stage clinical trials in the United States . 
The Maryland based company was awarded $ 1.6 billion from the federal government ’s Operation Warp Speed to fund its Phase 3 trial in the US and Mexico and to scale up manufacturing . 
Novavax 's vaccine is made by growing synthetic versions of the coronavirus spike protein in armyworm moth cells . 
The vaccine combines these particles with the company ’s adjuvant – a plant based compound that helps boost the immune response to the vaccine .
