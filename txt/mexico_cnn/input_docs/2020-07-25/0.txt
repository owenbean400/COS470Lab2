The ministry also reported 737 new deaths due to the virus , raising the country â€™s death toll to 42,645 . 
Despite the rising number of new cases , Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador reiterated his claim Friday that the coronavirus pandemic is " losing steam " in the country and attributed the new case numbers to an increase in testing capacity and a delay in updating the new cases . 
" We need to find a balance between health and economic situation , reopening carefully , practicing all the protocols , but we ca not stay immobilized . 
If we open and there 's an outbreak , we will close again , " Obrador said .
