Johnson & Johnson ’s Covid 19 vaccine candidate begins phase 3 trials in the United States on Wednesday . 
Trials for the single dose vaccine , which uses a human adenovirus , will include up to 60,000 adult participants at nearly 215 sites in the US and internationally . 
The vaccine candidate was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies , a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson . 
Phase 3 trials will begin immediately , with the first participants receiving doses Wednesday , Johnson & Johnson Chief Scientific Officer Dr . Paul Stoffels said on a call with reporters Tuesday . 
Initial findings from the vaccine ’s phase 1/2 trials in the US and Belgium suggest the vaccine provokes an immune response and is safe enough to move into large scale trials . 
Phase 3 trials will examine the safety and effectiveness of a single dose against a placebo to prevent symptomatic Covid 19 . 
The fact that the trial will examine the efficacy of a single dose of the vaccine , instead of two doses , should expedite results , said Stoffels . 
Trials will run in Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , Peru , South Africa and the United States . 
Johnson & Johnson intends to run a separate phase 3 trial in collaboration with the UK government to examine the effectiveness of two doses If the vaccine is proven safe and effective , Johnson & Johnson said it expects the first doses to be available for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration by early 2021 . 
Where things stand : Moderna , Pfizer/Bio NTech and Astra Zeneca also have Covid 19 vaccine candidates in Phase 3 trials in the United States , although Astra Zeneca ’s trial is currently paused . 
Johnson & Johnson ’s phase 3 trial is being conducted in collaboration with Operation Warp Speed , the federal government ’s coronavirus vaccine effort .
