More trained staff are needed to detect Covid 19 and implement protocols at the US Mexico border , said Dr . Ciro Ugarte , director of Health Emergencies at the Pan American Health Organization . 
Speaking during a briefing on Tuesday , PAHO said it and other organizations have been training staff so that they are better able to put these protocols into place – but it ’s not enough . 
" We do have protocols for the management and prevention of cases , but this is highly difficult because of the lack of trained staff , " Ugarte said . 
There has also been a call to increase surveillance at the border " to better respond from a medical point of view , " he said .
