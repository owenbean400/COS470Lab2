The World Health Organization ( WHO ) called on tobacco and nicotine industries across the world to stop taking advantage of the global pandemic and marketing directly to children and teens . 
Ruediger Krech , health promotion director at the WHO , said Thursday that more than 40 million teenagers around the globe have already started to use tobacco . 
Every year on May 31 , the WHO celebrates World No Tobacco Day ( WNTD ) to raise awareness on the deadly effects of smoking . 
" We see hundreds of thousands of people - of smokers - wanting to quit during this crisis , " Krech said . 
" There 's a huge uptake of tobacco cessation programs and demand to us to support people in quitting smoking . " 
Countries like Mexico , India , Jordan , Indonesia and China , along with parts of central and eastern Europe , have all seen an increase of cessation during the pandemic . 
" We are now looking for new technology solutions to make available to help those who want to quit , " Vinayak Prasad , coordinator with the No Tobacco Unit at WHO , said . 
WHO said in a statement that it is launching a kit aimed at teenagers to " alert them to the tobacco industry tactics used to hook them to addictive products . " 
" The toolkit exposes tactics , such as parties and concerts hosted by the tobacco and related industries , e cigarette flavors that attract youth like bubble gum and candy , e cigarette representatives presenting in schools , and product placement in popular youth streaming shows , " Prasad said . 
Adriana Blanco Marquizo , convention secretariat head at WHO 's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , said it is important to arm younger people to fight the tactics . 
" Adolescents and young people can be empowered to protect themselves when they understand the intention of this industry â€“ an industry that really wants them hooked in an addictive behavior , just in order to keep the profits , even if it goes against public health , " she said .
