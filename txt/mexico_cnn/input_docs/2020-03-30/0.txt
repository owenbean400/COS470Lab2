Opera legend Placido Domingo has been hospitalized in Acapulco , Mexico , with complications related to Covid 19 . 
Last Sunday , the Spanish tenor announced on his Facebook page that he had tested positive . 
The 79 year old resigned as general director of the Los Angeles Opera last year , after being accused of sexual harassment . 
While Domingo denied all allegations , the Los Angeles Opera 's independent investigation into 10 allegations of sexual harassment by Domingo were found to be credible earlier this month . 
Domingo joins a growing list of celebrities that have tested positive for coronavirus , including Idris Elba , Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson , Kevin Durant and Daniel Dae Kim .
