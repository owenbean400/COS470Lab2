More than 30 million students return to school in Mexico today . 
They will not be returning to the classroom , however , after the Mexican government announced earlier this month that all classes will be virtual . 
Nearly half of the country 's homes do not have internet connection but about 93 % have televisions , so the government has launched an ambitious plan to record lessons for every single grade level and broadcast educational content 24/7 .
