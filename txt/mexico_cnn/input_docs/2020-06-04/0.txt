Mexican authorities recorded more deaths Wednesday than any other day since the Covid 19 pandemic began . 
Health officials said 1,092 coronavirus related fatalities were identified in 24 hours -- more than doubling the previous single day record . 
The previous high , 501 deaths , was announced last week . 
More than 11,700 virus related deaths have been recorded in the country . 
An important caveat : Deputy Health Secretary Hugo LÃ³pez Gatell has consistently said the vast majority of deaths reported each day did not occur the day they were reported . 
Delays in counting deaths attributed to the virus mean that the deaths reported each day have occurred over the past several weeks . 
Another record : Authorities said they also identified another 3,912 cases of Covid 19 -- another daily record and the second day in a row that Mexico had its largest daily increase of new cases . 
Mexico has now recorded 101,238 cases -- surpassing 100,000 cases for the first time and becoming the 14th country worldwide to do so , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally .
