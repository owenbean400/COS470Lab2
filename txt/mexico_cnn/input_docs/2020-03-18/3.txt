The American Farm Bureau is raising concern over potential labor and supply chain issues as the State Department announced it is suspending immigrant and nonimmigrant visas out of their US embassies across Mexico . 
H2A seasonal workers make up about 250,000 of the farming workforce – with about 93 % coming from Mexico . 
With the closure of the US Embassy ’s , those visas are not being processed . 
US farms and ranches could face a serious labor shortage at a critical time for planting and harvesting crops essential to the domestic food supply , the American Farm Bureau said in a statement . 
" This is a critical matter for U.S . farmers and ranchers , " writes Duvall in the letter . 
" More than a quarter million individuals participate in the H 2A program and help to sustain U.S . farms and ranches . 
We urge the Administration to find an appropriate mechanism , either through an emergency waiver or some other means , to ensure that H 2A workers may continue to safely come to America ’s farms and ranches . " 
USDA acknowledges this concern and is actively speaking to the state department to minimize impact .
