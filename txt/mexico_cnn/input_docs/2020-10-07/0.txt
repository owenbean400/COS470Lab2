Syrian President Bashar al Assad wants to get Russia 's Sputnik V vaccine for Covid 19 , according to Russian state media . 
The vaccine , developed by the Moscow based Gamaleya Institute , was approved by Russia in August before it underwent late stage trials , raising concerns about its safety and efficacy . 
In an interview with state run news agency RIA Novosti , Assad said he would discuss a deal with Russian authorities so the vaccine could be sold to the Syrian market . 
Russia 's sovereign wealth fund ( RDIF ) , which has funded the vaccine production , has already announced deals with Mexico , India and Brazil . 
Asked if he would personally get vaccinated , Assad said : " Of course in these circumstances , anyone would love to be vaccinated against this dangerous virus . " 
The pandemic has reached crisis levels in government controlled parts of Syria , where health workers and facilities have been overwhelmed by a surge of cases in recent weeks . 
Ill equipped hospitals are overflowing with Covid 19 patients who are waiting for others to die so they can be put on ventilators that could save their lives , medics there say . 
In September , CNN spoke to three doctors in Damascus and Aleppo on the condition of anonymity , for fear of retribution from a government that tightly controls information . 
" Patients are literally waiting for other patients to die so they can be on a ventilator with people using contacts to pressure hospitals to move their loved ones up on the ventilator waiting list , " an Aleppo doctor using the name Ihsan told CNN last month . 
CNN contacted the Syrian ministry of health with a list of questions about the ongoing Covid 19 crisis in the country at the time the report was published , but did not receive a response .
