Coronavirus related cases and deaths across Latin America are rising faster than anywhere in the world . 
And in the worst hit countries , they show no signs of slowing down . 
The region has recorded nearly 1.2 million cases and more than 60,000 deaths . 
The WHO does not believe either Central or South America have reached peak transmission , meaning the number of people getting sick and dying might continue to rise . 
Brazil is stuck in crisis mode . 
The country has recorded at least 645,771 coronavirus cases and 35,026 deaths . 
It recently passed Italy to become the country with the third highest deaths in the world and will likely surpass the United Kingdom soon . 
Mexico recorded its worst week of the outbreak , both in confirmed cases and deaths . 
It recorded more than 1,000 deaths in a single day for the first time . 
And for three consecutive days , it recorded single day highs in new cases . 
Despite the bleak numbers , and conflicting messages from government leaders , officials have pushed ahead with a phased reopening plan across the country . 
Peru has one of Latin America 's worst outbreaks . 
It has 187,400 cases , the second highest in the region behind Brazil . 
People in the city of Callao lined up for hours this week to get their oxygen tanks refilled . 
But once they got to the front of the line , relatives of patients with Covid 19 found skyrocketing prices . 
Uruguay is the success story . 
The country of roughly 3.5 million people borders Brazil , which has the worst outbreak in Latin America . 
But Uruguay has recorded just 834 cases . 
It has recorded one death since May 24 and just 23 fatalities in total . 
Experts say the reasons for the country 's success are numerous -- a robust early response including quarantine measures , a large and efficient system of tracing and isolating those infected , randomized testing and the creation of a crisis response committee .
