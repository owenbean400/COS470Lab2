Rich nations including the United States , Britain and Japan have already bought up more than half the expected supply of coronavirus vaccine , the international anti poverty nonprofit Oxfam said Wednesday . 
These countries represent 13 % of the world ’s population , but have bought up future supplies of 51 % of coronavirus vaccines , Oxfam said . 
The group used data collected by analytics firm Airfinity to analyze published deals between governments and vaccine makers . 
Oxfam calculated five organizations -- Astra Zeneca , Russia ’s Gamaleya , Moderna , Pfizer and China ’s Sinovac -- have the combined production capacity to make 5.9 billion doses . 
That ’s enough to cover nearly 3 billion people -- less than half the world ’s population , if everyone needs two doses , as seems likely . 
Oxfam said in a statement that supply deals have already been agreed for 5.3 billion doses , of which 2.7 billion ( 51 % ) have been bought by developed countries and territories including the UK , US , Australia , Hong Kong , Macau , Japan , Switzerland and Israel , as well as the European Union . 
The remaining 2.6 billion doses have been bought by or promised to developing countries including India , Bangladesh , China , Brazil , Indonesia and Mexico . 
Oxfam noted that Astra Zeneca has pledged two thirds of the doses it produces to developing countries . 
When will we get enough vaccines ? 
On Monday , Adar Poonawalla , chief executive of the Serum Institute of India ( SII ) , predicted there may not be enough Covid 19 vaccine until 2024 . 
" It ’s going to take four to five years until everyone gets the vaccine on this planet , " Poonawalla told the Financial Times . 
Poonawalla estimated that if the Covid 19 shot is a two dose vaccine , the world would need about 15 billion doses .
