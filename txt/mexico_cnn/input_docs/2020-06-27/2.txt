The coronavirus pandemic is causing uncertainty for those working to become American citizens , including Maria Méndez who was fortunate enough to take the oath recently . 
When coronavirus hit , Méndez did not think she would be able to finish the naturalization process until next year . 
During the ceremony , she said everyone stood 6 feet apart . 
The whole process , which usually takes more than an hour , took less than five minutes . 
" It was really surreal and a strange experience , but I 'm very grateful that , you know , like I said , I was one of the lucky ones that got to still partake , despite , you know , the extreme circumstances that we 're living right now , " Méndez said . 
Living in fear : Méndez has lived in the US most of her life . 
She came here when she was young as an undocumented immigrant from Mexico . 
She said she considers Austin , Texas , her home – which is where she grew up and currently lives . 
Méndez said the fear that something would happen to her and her family was one thing that motivated her to become a citizen . 
" That was part of why I really wanted to be a US citizen so , one , I could vote in a country that , you know , I lived my whole life basically . 
And , two , to feel that weight kind of be lifted off , " she said .
