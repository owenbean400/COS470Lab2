US company Johnson & Johnson has said it will extend trials of its vaccine candidate against Covid 19 to Chile and Argentina . 
The vaccine will undergo Phase 3 trials in eight countries altogether , involving some 60,000 adult volunteers . 
The participation of Brazil , Colombia , Peru and Mexico had already been announced . 
" This study is scheduled for September , subject to review by the health authority , " the company said in a statement . 
The countries have been chosen because they have some of the highest infection rates worldwide . 
" The current prevalence of the disease , the demographics of the population and the requirements of the health authorities were taken into account to ensure that the study can be carried out properly and provide relevant data , " the company said . 
The study will be coordinated by Johnson & Johnson ’s pharmaceutical subsidiary Janssen . 
In Chile , the trial will be coordinated by the University of Chile ’s School of Medicine . 
Miguel O ’Ryan , Professor of Microbiology at the School , told Reuters that government approval was still needed for the trial , but it could begin within three weeks of the vaccine being delivered . 
O ’Ryan said the school was prepared to recruit up to 1,000 people for the study . 
Colombian President Ivan Duque said earlier this week that his government had also signed an agreement with Johnson & Johnson for Phase 3 trials . 
Last week , Brazil ’s regulatory authority Anvisa approved human clinical trials for the vaccine being developed by Johnson & Johnson .
