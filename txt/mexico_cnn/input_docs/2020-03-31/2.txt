Six Carmelite nuns have isolated themselves inside a care home in the Italian town of Castel del Monte , in order to look after the elderly residents who live there . 
" We voluntarily chose to stay because they need us , " Madre Rocio , one of the nuns , told CNN . 
" Like this , we are also close to God by helping who ca not help themselves . " 
Carmelite nuns are a contemplative order , which means they are devoted to prayer rather than works , but this group is semi cloistered , which means they are allowed to go outside . 
The six nuns , who are originally from Mexico , began helping out in the retirement home 15 years ago . While the Italian government has imposed a national mandatory quarantine , little has changed for the Carmelites of Castel del Monte . 
" We have not had much need to go out , thank God the municipality brings us everything in this period of quarantine , " said Madre Rocio . 
" Now that we are required to stay inside by the government , we are closer even to who we assist . " 
Madre Rocio described how the nuns eat and play cards with the elderly residents of the home . 
The town of Castel del Monte , in the mountains of Abruzzo , has welcomed dozens of refugees , and today has a population of 449 , including 115 people who originally hail from 25 different countries .
