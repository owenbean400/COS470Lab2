Mexican officials announced Tuesday that health care workers will receive top priority when the country ’s Covid 19 vaccination campaign begins this month , with other vulnerable populations following in the coming months . 
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters the country will receive 250,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in December , the majority of which will be given to health care workers in Mexico City , the center of the country ’s outbreak . 
In January , February , and March an additional 1 million doses of that same vaccine will arrive each month . 
Ebrard added an additional 12 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine will arrive in April . 
That will be enough to vaccinate roughly 7.6 million Mexicans , given the Pfizer vaccine ’s two dose requirement . 
In the first phase of the program , from December through February , health care workers will exclusively receive vaccinations . 
In the second phase , from February through April , remaining health care workers and adults aged 60 and over will receive priority . 
The next phases will see those 50-59 years of age vaccinated , followed by those 40-49 years of age , with the rest of the country getting vaccinated after that . 
The country hopes to vaccinate 75 % of citizens over age 16 by the first quarter of 2022 . 
The main goal of the campaign is to reduce Covid 19 deaths , officials said at Tuesday ’s briefing . 
Mexico says it has purchases agreements for tens of millions more doses from other vaccine suppliers and hopes to finalize those agreements in the coming weeks and months . 
Health officials added that Mexico ’s military will assist the country ’s health ministry with the logistics of vaccine distribution . 
Mexico has the fourth highest number of Covid 19 deaths worldwide , according to the Johns Hopkins University tally .
