The European Commission has launched infringement proceedings against 10 European Union member states for failing to protect the rights of passengers when journeys have had to be cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic . 
National legislation in place in Czech Republic , Cyprus , Greece , France , Italy , Croatia , Lithuania , Poland , Portugal and Slovakia violates EU rules on travel , the Commission said Friday . 
Further action has also been launched against Greece and Italy for failing to protect bus , rail and ferry passengers . 
Under EU law , passengers have " the right to choose between reimbursement in money and other forms of refund , such as a voucher " if a flight has been cancelled and are expected to be reimbursed within two weeks . 
In the 10 aforementioned countries , the Commission says authorities are only allowing travel operators to " issue vouchers , instead of reimbursement in money , " or taking longer than 14 days to refund passengers . 
The Commission says throughout the crisis it has " consistently made clear that consumer rights remain valid in the current unprecedented context and national measures to support the industry must not lower them . " 
The 10 countries now have two months to reply and prove to the Commission they have rectified these issues .
