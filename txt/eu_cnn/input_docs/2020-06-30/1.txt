Following an announcement that the European Union will bar American travelers from entering its member countries as borders begin to reopen , a US State Department spokesperson said the country is " committed to coordinating with them as we look forward to reopening our economies and easing restrictions . " 
The spokesperson noted that as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said , " We â€™ve been working with countries all across the world , including our friends in Europe and the EU proper , to determine how it is we can best safely reopen international travel . " 
The State Department will continue to urge US citizens to check embassy or consulate websites for information about travel . 
What this is about : Earlier today , the EU formally agreed a set of recommendations that will allow travelers from outside the bloc to visit EU countries , months after it shut its external borders in response to the outbreak of Covid 19 . 
As had been widely expected , the list of 14 countries does not include the United States , whose current Covid infection rate does not meet the criteria set by the EU for it to be considered a " safe country . " 
The list of approved countries included in the recommendations are : Algeria , Australia , Canada , Georgia , Japan , Montenegro , Morocco , New Zealand , Rwanda , Serbia , South Korea , Thailand , Tunisia and Uruguay .
