The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) has launched a rolling review process of the Covid 19 vaccine candidate being developed by Bio NTech in collaboration with Pfizer . 
What is a rolling review ? 
According to the EMA , " a rolling review is one of the regulatory tools that the agency uses to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency . " 
This means that instead of evaluating all the data on the vaccine after it is completed , the agency will evaluate the data as it becomes available , in order to speed up its potential approval , if all the safety and effectiveness criteria are met . 
" The start of the rolling review means that the committee has started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine , which come from laboratory studies ( non clinical data ) , " the EMA said in a statement on Tuesday . 
The EMA added that this does not mean that a conclusion on the vaccine 's safety and effectiveness can be reached yet , with much of the evidence still to be submitted . 
Last week the agency started its first review process of a Covid 19 vaccine , when it began a rolling review on the candidate being developed by Astra Zeneca in collaboration with the University of Oxford . 
In September , Bio NTech CEO and co founder Ugur Sahin told CNN they are confident they can have a vaccine against the novel coronavirus ready for regulatory approval by the middle of October or early November .
