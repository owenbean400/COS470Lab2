A European Union lawmaker and physician has called the UK ’s decision to authorize the Pfizer/Bio Ntech vaccine " hasty , " and is recommending other European countries do not follow suit . 
In a statement published on the official ’s website on Wednesday , Peter Liese , health policy spokesman of the European People 's Party -- the largest political group in the EU Parliament -- said : Liese stressed his criticism of the UK ’s decision has " nothing to do with Brexit " according to the statement . 
However , he accuses it of being " an attempt to distract attention from the failure of Boris Johnson 's government in the Corona crisis , " it reads . 
EU member states cannot distribute a Covid 19 vaccine until it has been approved by the EMA and signed off by the European Commission , according to the EMA ’s rules . 
The EMA will conclude its decision on the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine on December 29 , and Moderna on January 12 . 
The European Commission would then need a few days to prepare the legal paperwork and discuss its decision to authorize the vaccine with member states , a spokesperson told CNN . 
" If the European Medicines Agency concludes in the course of this month that the vaccination is safe , I will recommend that everyone will be vaccinated . 
As long as this is not the case , one should be careful , " Liese said . 
" I have confidence in Biontech , but ‘ Confidence is good , control is better ’ . 
Emergency authorisation is a tool normally intended for patients who suffer from a serious and incurable disease and where there is no other means of saving life or physical integrity . 
This is not the case with corona , " the statement read .
