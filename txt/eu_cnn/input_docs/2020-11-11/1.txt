The European Union is following reports of coronavirus outbreaks in mink farms " extremely closely , " Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said Wednesday during a press conference . 
Last week , the Danish government ordered a cull of its entire mink population due to concerns about a virus mutation that had arisen in infected mink . 
On Tuesday , it backtracked on the order , after realizing it had no legal authority to mandate the killing of mink on farms unaffected by coronavirus . 
It will now merely " recommend " that farmers kill all mink , according to an email sent to breeders Tuesday morning . 
New legislation is being put to parliament to legally mandate a cull . 
It normally takes 30 days to pass new legislation . 
" We â€™re very aware of the situation of the mink farms in Denmark , it 's a situation that as the Commission and with the ECDC ( the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ) we are following very carefully . 
I would also say that infection in mink has been reported in other member states , and in other third countries , " Kyriakides said . 
" Of course , the measures taken in Denmark are national competence , but I would like to tell you that we are expecting a risk assessment from the ECDC in the coming days , so we 'll be able to have more details on that , but we are following the situation extremely closely , " she added .
