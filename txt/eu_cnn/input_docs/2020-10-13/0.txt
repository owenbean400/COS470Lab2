European Union countries have agreed to a set of criteria to make the reporting of coronavirus cases and travel restrictions easier to understand . 
The EU hopes they will make travel more predictable , and help prevent further disruption caused by the pandemic . 
The recommendations adopted Tuesday include a new weekly " traffic light " map that will be published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) showing countries ' different epidemiological situations . 
The three categories for countries are : Red : High risk -- quarantine on arrival/take a test ( some countries may require a negative test in advance ) Orange : Medium risk -- quarantine on arrival/take a test ( some countries may require a negative test in advance ) Green : Low risk -- no restrictions when traveling to another part of the EU . 
The categories will be based on a clear set of comparable data from each country . 
The new guidelines also set out how much notice should be given when travel restrictions are to be applied when a country moves from one category to another . 
A member state intending to apply restrictions should inform the affected country and the European Commission at least 48 hours in advance . 
Members of the public and businesses should then be given clear , comprehensive and timely information at least 24 hours before new restrictions come into place . 
The recommendations are not legally binding , and the decision whether to implement them remains up to each member state .
