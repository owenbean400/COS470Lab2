Tourists who travel in Europe this summer do so at their own risk , the European Commissioner for Transport Adina Ioana Valean told CNN 's Hala Gorani on Wednesday . 
On Wednesday the European Union unveiled an action plan to get its internal borders reopening , safely fire up its hospitality sector and to revive rail , road , air and sea connections that have been strangled during the pandemic . 
The plan includes proposals for permitting special " green corridors " or " travel bubbles " that would allow certain countries with low or sharply declining infection rates to open up to a select few destinations until borders are fully reopened . 
Regarding hotels , the commissioner said measures , such as disinfection and social distancing , " can be observed easily but the risk is taken by the traveler in the end because no one can guarantee [ safety ] " . 
As for plane and train travel , Valen said the EU is recommending the use of masks and physical distancing " as a matter of principle " . 
However , she added , that might not be possible from an economic point of view on a plane . 
" A flight cannot observe 2 meters between passengers because it wo not be worth it to fly that route , " she said . 
The commissioner added that the so called travel bubbles will depend on the decision taken on a national level . 
Regarding EU wide travel guidelines , she said the bloc is aiming for the measures to be " proportionate and not discriminatory and applied the same way all over Europe " .
