Travelers from the United States are " unlikely " to be allowed into the European Union as ambassadors of the 27 members states have agreed " in principle " to the criteria they will apply as the bloc begins to opens up , several EU officials told CNN on Friday The agreement is not final as the ambassadors will still need to consult with their respective governments . 
Under the current criteria — which takes into account the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the past 14 days — the US would likely be excluded . 
An EU diplomat told CNN that it was very " unlikely " travelers from the US would be allowed in , adding that even though the list had not been finalized " the US ’s chances are close to zero . " 
The diplomat also said , " with their infection rates ... not even they can believe in that possibility . " 
Asked if the US was on a draft list of countries whose citizens would not be allowed to travel to the EU starting Wednesday , another EU diplomat would not confirm that list existed but said , " if you run the numbers you can create a list . " 
The first point on the checklist asks whether the country can " be considered as being in a comparable or better epidemiological situation as the average in the EU + area " with regard to number of new infections , trend of new infections and response in areas such as testing , surveillance , contact tracing , containment , treatment and reporting .
