Nearly all people arriving in the Netherlands will now need to provide proof of a negative coronavirus PCR test , taken within the past 72 hours . 
The rule applies to arrivals from within and outside the European Union , whether arriving by air , train , or bus -- but not those coming into the country by private car . 
The test requirement does not negate the requirement to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival , nor the EU wide ban on non essential travel from outside the bloc . 
So far , 11,042 people in the Netherlands have died of Covid 19 and 770,400 have been infected , according to data from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment . 
The government announced the new rule last week ; it came into effect Tuesday at midnight . 
" This is one of the Dutch measures to prevent the import and spread of the coronavirus , " the government said in a statement .
