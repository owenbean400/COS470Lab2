The European Commission has signed a € 63 million ( $ 74 million ) contract with pharmaceutical company Gilead , to secure doses of antiviral drug remdesivir , the first medicine authorised by the EU for treating coronavirus . 
" The Commission has been working tirelessly with Gilead to reach an agreement to ensure that stocks of the first treatment authorised against Covid 19 are delivered to the EU , " Stella Kyriakides , the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety , said Wednesday in a statement . 
" A contract has been signed yesterday , less than a month after the authorisation of remdesivir , which will allow the delivery of treatments from early August for thousands of patients , " she added . 
The purchase was financed by the EU Emergency Support Instrument , a new € 2.7 billion fund ( $ 3.1 billion ) which was created to help the bloc 's member states recover from the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The purchase will help treat an estimated 30,000 patients presenting severe symptoms of coronavirus . 
" The Commission is now also preparing a joint procurement for further supplies of the medicine , expected to cover additional needs and supplies as from October onwards , " the statement added . 
Remdesivir was originally studied as a potential treatment for Ebola , before research revealed it could work against coronavirus .
