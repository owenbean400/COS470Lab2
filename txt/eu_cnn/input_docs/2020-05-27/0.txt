Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Wednesday the European Union Commission â€™s proposed 750 billion euros ( $ 823 billion ) recovery fund " includes many of our demands . " 
The proposal to help the European Union economy amid the Covid 19 pandemic includes 500 billion euros ( $ 549 billion ) in grants and 250 billion euros ( $ 274 billion ) in loans . 
" We should reach soon an agreement to have access to resources that will allow us to restart the economy and overcome the crisis , " Sanchez said . 
Spain has been among the countries pushing for the package to be based on grants , not loans , which some northern EU countries prefer .
