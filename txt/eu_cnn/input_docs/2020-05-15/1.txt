Germany will ease quarantine restrictions for incoming travelers from the EU , the Schengen passport free zone and the UK , the country 's interior ministry announced at a Friday press briefing . 
Ministry spokesperson Björn Grünewälder said Germany would only ask travelers to go into quarantine if they arrive from countries with elevated numbers of infections . 
A two week mandatory quarantine still applies to arriving visitors from countries outside the EU . 
Interior minister Horst Seehofer announced earlier this week that Germany had " set the clear goal of free travel in Europe by mid June " and would start easing border controls this week . 
The country 's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has also raised the topic of travel restrictions , calling for a dialogue with his European counterparts to discuss how the limits can be eased for popular holiday destinations . 
Germany 's foreign ministry has invited representatives from Spain , Italy , Austria , Greece , Croatia , Portugal , Malta , Slovenia , Cyprus and Bulgaria to a video conference on the topic on Monday . 
The goal of the meeting is to coordinate the opening of borders for tourists . 
But Maas has already warned that travelers cannot expect to take holidays as normal this summer . 
Germany has extended its worldwide global travel warning until at least June 14 .
