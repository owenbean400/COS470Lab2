About 100 countries are backing a resolution at the upcoming World Health Assembly ( WHA ) calling for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic . 
The wording of the resolution is weak compared to Australia 's previous calls for a probe into China 's role and responsibility in the origin of the pandemic . 
This may have been necessary to get a majority of WHO member states to sign on -- particularly those , such as Russia , with traditionally strong ties to Beijing . 
But that does not mean China 's government should rest easy . 
The potential for an independent probe to turn up damning or embarrassing information is great -- even one not initially tasked with investigating an individual country 's response . 
Australian government sources told the ABC , the country 's public broadcaster , that the resolution 's language was sufficiently strong to " ensure that a proper and thorough investigation took place . " 
Beijing has previously said it would only support an investigation held by the WHO , which has been accused of being overly influenced by China -- a charge top WHO officials refute . 
With more countries signing on to the EU resolution as the assembly nears , that may be out of China 's hands .
