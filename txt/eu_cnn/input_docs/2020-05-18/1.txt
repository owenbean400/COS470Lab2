The UK is likely missing between 50,000-70,000 Covid 19 cases because it has not updated its list of coronavirus symptoms , a professor who leads the Kings College London Covid Symptom Tracker app said Monday . 
Professor Tim Spector told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that his team 's app has listed " about 14 symptoms which [ they ] know are related to having a positive swab test and these are not being picked up by the NHS . " 
These include symptoms such as the loss of smell and taste and severe muscle pain and fatigue . 
Professor Spector said the app is the " largest source of data " in the UK , with more than 1.5 million signed up to offer information about their response to the virus . 
Citizens in the dark about symptoms : He said that UK citizens are not aware of the full spectrum of symptoms due to the lack of testing and the advice to only self isolate if they have a high fever or cough . 
" There 's no point telling people to be alert if they do not know the symptoms , " he added . 
Other countries expand lists : Professor Spector noted 17 other countries , the WHO , the EU and even the CDC altered and expanded their list of symptoms a few weeks ago . 
Since the UK began testing , 243,695 people have tested positive for the virus , according to the latest figures from the Department of Health and Social Care . 
Spector advised that " Public Health England ... get in line with the rest of the world and make people more aware . " 
He estimated that there are 100,000 cases of infected people in the UK at present and stressed that " there are still people out there who can infect others and we do have to be very vigilant , " as some parts of the UK begin to ease their lockdown .
