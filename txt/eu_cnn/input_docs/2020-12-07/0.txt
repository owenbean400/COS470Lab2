The British Army could " potentially " be used to help transport doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech coronavirus vaccine from Belgium to the UK , Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly told BBC Breakfast on Monday . 
Britain became the first Western country to approve a Covid 19 vaccine on December 2 . 
The first doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine will be administered from Tuesday in England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . 
Northern Ireland was the last country to confirm a start date for vaccinations , with its Department of Health making an announcement on Sunday night . 
The department said those carrying out the vaccinations would be the first to receive them . 
Cleverly said Monday that the UK government was looking into " non commercial flight options " to transport the vaccine , which he called a " top priority product . " 
Transport arrangements for the vaccine are immensely complex as it needs to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius -- minus more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit . 
During his Sky News appearance , Cleverly said the UK had " border arrangements in place " to facilitate the transport of the vaccine . 
When asked the details of these arrangements , Cleverly said he did " not have the details to hand " he had " no doubt that the EU will help us to facilitate better travel . " 
His comments come as the EU and UK remain deadlocked over a post Brexit trade deal . 
Despite this , Cleverly appeared confident that tense relations between the two sides would not affect co operation over the transport of the vaccine . 
Remarking that there are " lives at stake , " Cleverly said he did not have a cynical view regarding the EU 's willingness to help the UK .
