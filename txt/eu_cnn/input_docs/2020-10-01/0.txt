Germany lifted its blanket warning against traveling to all countries outside the European Union , the country ’s foreign ministry announced Thursday . 
Germany imposed a global travel warning at the beginning of March when the coronavirus outbreak hit Italy , lifting travel restrictions for most European countries in June . 
But due to rising coronavirus infections in Europe , the foreign ministry announced on Wednesday that it had extended an existing travel warning for parts of Belgium to cover the entire country . 
The same applies to most of France . 
The ministry also warned against travel to Wales , Northern Ireland as well as Gibraltar and Iceland . 
Early in September , the federal government re issued travel warnings for regions in Europe where infection levels rose above the level of 50 cases per 100,000 people a week . 
On Thursday , cases rose by 2,503 to 291,722 within the past 24 hours , according to data from the country 's infectious disease agency , the Robert Koch Institute . 
The death toll increased by 12 to 9,500 . 
The country ’s reproduction rate currently stands at 0.96 .
