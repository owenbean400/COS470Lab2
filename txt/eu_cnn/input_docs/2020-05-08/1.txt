The European Commission is encouraging countries in the European Union to extend restrictions on nonessential travel and to keep external borders closed until June 15 . 
" While some EU and Schengen Associated States are taking preliminary steps towards easing the measures for fighting the spread of the pandemic , the situation remains fragile both in Europe and worldwide . 
This calls for continued measures at the external borders to reduce the risk of the disease spreading through travel to the EU . 
The lifting of travel restrictions should be phased , " the European Commission said in a statement Friday . 
The " invite " is not binding and the opening of the countries ' external borders is a decision at national level . 
The EU decided to close its external borders on March 17 , except for essential travel . 
The restrictions apply to the " EU+area , " a total of 30 countries including Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway , and Switzerland .
