A survey by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) found 31 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom are considering prioritizing " older age groups , healthcare workers and persons with underlying conditions " to receive Covid 19 vaccines first . 
Of those countries , nine : Austria , Belgium , the Czech Republic , France , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and the UK have already published more detailed plans of which groups of citizens will be prioritized . 
This could however be modified as more evidence becomes available about the virus " epidemiology and characteristics of vaccines , including information on vaccine safety and efficacy by age and target group , " the report found . 
It also noted that with a limited supply of vaccines in the first round of inoculations , " it is expected that most countries will refine their priority groups as Austria , France and Spain have done . " 
Due to the challenge of delivering a large scale vaccination program the EU health authority found , " some countries mentioned the need for a bigger pool of skilled workforce to administer the vaccines as more doses will become available . " 
Twelve countries surveyed by the ECDC said they were planning to mobilize and train other medical staff such as : nurses , midwives , medical students , general practitioners , other medical staff , " in order to ensure sufficient capacity of vaccination services to deliver Covid 19 vaccines . " 
Most countries reported that Covid 19 vaccines will be provided free of charge to their citizens . 
The EU regulator , the European Medicines Agency has begun the process of approving vaccines by Bio NTech/Pfizer and Moderna and aims to provide a decision by December 29 on Bio NTech/Pfizer and January 12 next year for Moderna . 
Once approved the European Commission will work with EU countries to formally sign off in a process that they expect to take a couple of days .
