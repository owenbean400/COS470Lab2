The European Union is urging Netflix and other streaming platforms to stop showing video in high definition to prevent the internet from breaking because of the coronavirus pandemic . 
With so many countries on lockdowns to fight the spread of the virus , hundreds of millions working from home and even more children out of school , EU officials are concerned about the strain on internet bandwidth . 
European Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted Wednesday evening that he had spoken with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings . 
Breton called on viewers and companies to " # Switchto Standard definition when HD is not necessary " to secure internet access for all . 
A Netflix spokesperson told CNN Business that Hastings and Breton will speak again on Thursday , and said it already adjusts streaming quality and tries to minimize bandwidth consumption . 
Facebook on Wednesday acknowledged that the effects of the pandemic were stretching it to the limit . 
In a call with reporters , CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was facing " big surges " in use as the coronavirus forces millions to stay home . 
He described the increase in demand as " well beyond " the annual spike usually seen on New Year 's Eve . 
Voice and video calls on Whats App and Facebook Messenger , in particular , are more than double usual levels .
