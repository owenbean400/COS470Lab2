UK business groups have warned of the impact of new Covid 19 travel restrictions on their supply chains . 
Industry groups and leading firms have said they do not expect food shortages in the days leading up to Christmas , but they warned of major disruption if the situation is not resolved quickly . 
Major UK ports have closed after France blocked trucks from travelling out of the UK because of fears of a new Covid 19 variant . 
Other European countries have also imposed various travel restrictions on the UK . 
Brexit means the current trade arrangements between the UK and European Union are due to end on December 31 , which could cause further disruption . 
Sainsbury 's , one of the UK â€™s leading supermarket chains , said if nothing changes the UK will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce , some salad leaves , cauliflowers , broccoli and citrus fruit -- all of which are imported from the continent at this time of year . 
Shane Brennan , the CEO of the Cold Chain Federation , which deals with moving frozen and chilled goods , said " Whilst we face no shortages now , we do need urgent agreements between the UK and EU Governments to find a way to safely allow freight movements to continue . 
This has been possible at every other stage through the pandemic . 
An extended period of stopped movement now will cause significant problems for supply chains in January . "
