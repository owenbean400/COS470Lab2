The European Union is forecast to contract by a record 7.5 % this year , according to a new forecast from the European Commission , as the coronavirus batters economies around the world . 
In its spring economic forecast , the commission predicts the contraction of " historic proportion " and says the EU will rebound in 2021 , with growth of 6 % predicted for that year . 
The forecast says that every EU country will enter recession this year , but the full impact and the strength of the recovery in each member state will " differ markedly . " 
" Europe is experiencing an economic shock without precedent since the Great Depression , " said Paolo Gentiloni , European commissioner for the economy . 
" Both the depth of the recession and the strength of recovery will be uneven , conditioned by the speed at which lockdowns can be lifted , the importance of services like tourism in each economy and by each country 's financial resources . 
Such divergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area -- yet it can be mitigated through decisive , joint European action . 
We must rise to this challenge . "
