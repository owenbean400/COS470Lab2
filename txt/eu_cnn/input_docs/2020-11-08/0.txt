The European Commission has hailed the success of its cross border Covid 19 contact tracing system . 
In a tweet on Sunday , the Commission highlighted the work of Germany , Ireland , Italy , Latvia and Spain in using the system to ensure that " their contact and warning apps work across borders . " 
As Europe continues to record significant coronavirus case numbers , there has been a push for greater cooperation between states regarding contact tracing . 
A map accompanying the tweet depicted the status of contact tracing systems in place throughout the EU . 
When an app user logs that they have tested positive for Covid 19 , their phone only sends the user â€™s anonymized ID to a central database and it is the phone itself that downloads the database and carries out contact matching . 
Presently , only decentralized apps work across borders using the EU system .
