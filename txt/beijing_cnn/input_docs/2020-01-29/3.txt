The Chinese city of Wuhan , where the coronavirus outbreak began , has been in lockdown since last week in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus . 
There is no movement in or out of the city . 
Transport within the city has also been halted or limited , and the roads are empty of cars . 
The streets are mostly empty as people stay at home , afraid of being infected outside . 
There is also construction going on -- Chinese authorities are building a brand new , 1,000 bed hospital in the city . 
They say it will be built in one week 's time , and will be ready for use by February 3 . 
This is not the first time they 've built hospital in mere days . 
During the 2003 SARS crisis , Xiaotangshan Hospital was constructed in six days and seven nights in Beijing , and used to treat almost 700 SARS patients . 
Anyone who is not home in Wuhan right now is on high alert and taking extra precautions . 
In a hotel , staff take the temperature of any guest that enters the building -- not that there are many . 
A photo of the hotel cafe shows empty chairs and tables . 
There are some who choose to brave the risk and continue on with daily life . 
Some residents simply put on protective face masks -- then go about exercising in parks , biking around the city , or buying groceries at the store .
