Outside of Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- infections are predicted to continue growing for weeks , if not months . 
More cases expected : Researchers at Imperial College London have estimated that at least 4,000 people were infected in Wuhan by January 18 , almost a week before the lockdown of the city began . 
Their model suggests a low nationwide figure of 20,000 infections in China by the end of the month , potentially as high as 100,000 . 
Possible peak in 10 days : Speaking to state media Tuesday , Zhong Nanshan , one of China 's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS , said he expected the peak to come in up to 10 days . 
Others say virus could still spread : Other experts have warned that while the outbreak in Hubei may peak in the coming weeks , other Chinese megacities may see self sustaining epidemics that continue to spread the pathogen around the country and worldwide . 
" We modeled epidemic curves out to August 2020 for all the major city clusters : Chongqing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , Shenzhen and Beijing . 
Chongqing is predicted to have the largest epidemic due to large population and most intense traffic volume coupled to Wuhan , " Gabriel Leung , a leading Hong Kong researcher and public health expert , said earlier this week . 
Spring and summer : He said outbreaks in China 's largest cities could peak in April or May and gradually slow in June and July .
