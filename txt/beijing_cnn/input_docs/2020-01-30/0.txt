Elon Musk 's Tesla factory in China just got up and running . 
Now its vehicle production there will be delayed because of the deadly Wuhan virus outbreak . 
Beijing has taken extraordinary measures to try and contain the outbreak , including placing major cities on lockdown and extending the Lunar New Year holiday . 
Officials in Shanghai , where Tesla 's China factory is located , extended the holiday period from January 30 to February 9 . 
" At this point , we 're expecting a 1 to 1Â½ week delay in the ramp ( up ) of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown , " Tesla 's chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said during an earnings call Wednesday . 
Kirkhorn said the hit to Tesla earnings will be limited because profits from the China made cars are still in the early stages . 
He added that the company is also keeping an eye on whether there will be supply chain disruptions for Tesla 's California made cars .
