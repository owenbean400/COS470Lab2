Taiwanese health officials have rejected China ’s condition for the island to take part in the World Health Organization -- Chinese officials said yesterday that the self governed island would only be allowed to join the body " in accordance with the one China principle . " 
Some background : Taiwan is not a WHO member . 
The self ruled , democratic island is claimed by China as part of its territory and Beijing blocks Taiwan from participating in many international organizations unless it does so in a way that acknowledges it is part of China . 
Why is this coming up now ? 
Taiwanese officials and other observers have claimed the island 's exclusion from the WHO has had a negative effect both during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) epidemic and the current pandemic . 
Yesterday , China ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it " opposes so called proposals " by countries to invite Taiwan to join the World Health Assembly as an observer , adding that the countries which insist on discussing Taiwan ’s participation are " only seeking to severely disrupt this World Health Assembly and undermine global anti pandemic cooperation . " 
Taiwan 's response : Deputy Foreign Minister Kelly Hsieh argued today that it was Taiwan 's " right " to participate in the WHO .
