Production at China 's factories is growing for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began . 
But there are still major challenges ahead for the country 's economy . 
Industrial output increased 3.9 % in April from a year ago , according to data released Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics . 
That 's well above the 1.5 % uptick that analysts polled by Refinitiv expected , and the first time output has grown since December . 
This growth can be attributed to the political pressure that Beijing is putting on factories to resume production , Julian Evans Pritchard , senior China economist for Capital Economics , wrote in a research note on Friday . 
He expects factory output to continue to grow , since policymakers in China have signaled that more stimulus measures are on the way . 
But it was not all good news : Domestic demand remains very weak , and retail sales in China dropped 7.5 % in April from a year earlier . 
And the official unemployment rate -- which tracks jobless numbers in urban areas -- reached 6 % , up from 5.9 % in March and just shy of February 's record of 6.2 % . 
Evans Pritchard said that the true unemployment rate is " likely double " what was announced Friday , since the urban rate does not include people in rural communities or a large number of the 290 million migrant workers who work in China .
