All international travelers arriving in Beijing , regardless of their final destinations , will be quarantined and tested for the coronavirus at designated government facilities at their own expense , Chinese authorities announced today . 
The procedures will also apply to people arriving in Beijing after entering China through a different port of entry within the past 14 days . 
The new rules will take effect Wednesday , amid continued concerns over the rising number of imported cases coming to China from overseas . 
The government reported 78 new cases nationwide on Monday , of which 74 were imported . 
Previous measures : Authorities have previously ordered all Beijing bound international flights diverted to 12 other Chinese cities for health screenings , as well as immigration and customs clearance . 
Only passengers deemed healthy and low risk are allowed to continue their travel to Beijing . 
With a few exceptions , travelers arriving from abroad whose final destination is Beijing are already required to undergo a 14 day quarantine at government designated facilities at their own expense .
