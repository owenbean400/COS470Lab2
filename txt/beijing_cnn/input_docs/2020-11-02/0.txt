A mass testing campaign in China 's tightly controlled western region of Xinjiang has revealed the country 's worst coronavirus outbreak in months . 
Authorities in the heavily policed region -- where Beijing has been accused of detaining more than a million Muslims -- reported 13 new locally transmitted Covid 19 cases Monday , according to the state run People 's Daily news outlet . 
The outlet cited a press conference held by the Xinjiang government on Monday night . 
The cases were all asymptomatic and were reported in Shufu County , in Xinjiang 's Kashgar area , near the border with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan . 
All the infections are among people who were already under quarantine and medical surveillance , People 's Daily reported . 
In late October , Kashgar launched a mass testing program for its 4.7 million residents after an asymptomatic case was identified in Shufu County . 
The total number of infections in Xinjiang now stands at 59 symptomatic cases and 236 asymptomatic cases . 
It 's the country 's biggest coronavirus cluster since more than 180 infections were reported in the capital Beijing in June .
