The Indian government is in touch with its citizens currently in Wuhan and are seeking " possible travel options out of Hubei province , " Ministry of External Affairs ( MEA ) spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said on Twitter Sunday . 
This comes after it came to light that 56 Indian students , studying at the Wuhan University School Of Medicine , had been trapped in the Chinese city for three days . 
Many of the students were afraid to leave their dorm room and fearful of dwindling food supples . 
Normally a transport hub for central China , Wuhan has been closed off from the rest of the country since Thursday -- when the city was placed on lockdown . 
One of the students told CNN they had not received any assistance from Indian authorities . 
Kumar said on Sunday that the Indian Embassy in Beijing was " in close touch with Indian citizens including students to extend assistance , " adding " that no Indian citizens have been affected by the outbreak & that food & water supplies are available to them . "
