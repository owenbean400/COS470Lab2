The pandemic has infected more than 100,000 people around the globe -- but it 's not just humans impacted . 
Many animals in Wuhan , the Chinese city where the virus is believed to have originated , have died or are at risk of dying after residents evacuated their homes in the wake of the lockdown , animal advocates have said . 
Wendy Higgins , director of international media at Humane Society International , told CNN that dogs and cats have been left behind in apartments -- not just in Wuhan , but in cities such as Beijing , too . 
" Estimates are impossible , but we do know that in Wuhan , for example , animal activists have assisted with animals in upwards of 1,000 apartments . 
So , the numbers nationwide will be significant , " she said . 
The pets are at risk of starvation . 
Residents who were forced to leave their pets behind typically left enough food and water to last them for a few days , thinking they would be able to return soon , some animal advocates told CNN . 
But nearly a month after they evacuated , many residents have not returned home . 
There may be tens of thousands of dogs and cats left behind in Hubei Province , said Vshine Animal Protection Association , a China based animal welfare and environmental organization which partners with Humane Society International . 
Vshine has received at least 400 calls from residents in the city of Dalian alone , asking for employees to check in on their pets .
