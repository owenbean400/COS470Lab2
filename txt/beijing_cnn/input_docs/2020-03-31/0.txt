China will delay its national college entrance examination by a month , the education ministry announced Tuesday , as many schools remain closed nationwide due to the novel coronavirus outbreak . 
The all important standardized test , taken by millions of Chinese students each year , will now be administered on July 7 and July 8 . 
Exam time for Beijing and Hubei province -- the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic -- will be decided separately , with new dates to be announced later . 
For context : During the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003 -- which began in southern China and killed 774 people globally -- China did not postpone the exam . 
After the Sichuan earthquake in May 2008 , which killed almost 90,000 people , areas affected by the quake postponed the exam . 
The test is notoriously hard , and many of the millions of students who sit it face incredible pressure from their parents and families to do well in the exam so they can secure a spot at a top university .
