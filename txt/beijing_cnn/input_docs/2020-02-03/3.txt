Thousands of Hong Kong public medical staff voted to go on a five day strike today if the city 's government does not fully close the border with mainland China . 
Hong Kong is a semiautonomous city and operates its own immigration system separate from Beijing . 
The city 's leader , Carrie Lam , announced last week the city would temporarily close some of its border crossings to the mainland . 
But some members of the medical community want the government to do more , and thousands of medical staff are calling on the HKSAR government to ban all visitors from mainland China to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus to Hong Kong . 
The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance , which has 13,000 members , voted in favor of a strike Saturday . 
The union said however that the majority of frontline staff will not take part in the strike in order to keep serving the public , but support and backroom staff will walk out . 
Hong Kong 's government said in a statement Sunday it will meet with members of the union who voted to strike .
