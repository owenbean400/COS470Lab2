China 's Center For Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] has said a new outbreak in Beijing is now under control . 
A sudden outbreak of the disease in the Chinese capital has been linked to the city 's largest wholesale food market , Xinfadi . 
The flare up is the worst coronavirus resurgence in China since the initial epidemic was largely brought under control in March . 
Chief epidemiologist Wu Zunyou said Thursday that the situation was under control , adding that newly confirmed cases linked to the market would likely emerge in the coming days , but that these were unlikely to be caused by fresh transmission . 
The CDC chief epidemiologist said other outbreaks could happen across China because of the nature of the global pandemic and the risk of imported cases . 
" The global pandemic is still at a high level . 
On average , there are more than 100,000 new cases reported every day . 
As long as there are risks of imported cases , imported infections and small scale clusters caused by imported infections might occur anywhere in China , " he said . 
The expert praised the actions of the Beijing authorities in taking rapid action to cut off the transmission of the virus . 
Beijing has embarked on a mass testing spree of some 356,000 people connected to the market . 
The site itself has been closed and several nearby neighbourhoods were sealed to contain the outbreak .
