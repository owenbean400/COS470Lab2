Beijing police have launched a criminal investigation into a coronavirus patient who traveled to China from the US while showing symptoms , and was confirmed infected after arriving . 
The patient , a woman identified by her surname , Li , is a resident of Massachusetts , said Beijing authorities in a statement online . 
She had attended a company conference in late February , where one of her colleagues later tested positive for the coronavirus . 
The timeline : Li began noticing symptoms on March 1 , like muscle aches , a fever , cough , and runny nose . 
She visited a local hospital on March 3 , before subsequent visits on March 5 , March 10 , and March 11 ; she was prescribed antiviral medication and given a chest radiograph , but says she was not hospitalized . 
Finally , on March 12 , she traveled to Los Angeles , then flew onward to Beijing with her husband and son . 
On the flight : A few hours after takeoff , Li told flight crew that she was experiencing symptoms . 
She was asked to sit in an isolation zone on the plane , and wear a mask . 
It was not for several more hours -- shortly before arriving in Beijing -- that she told crew members she had been at a conference with a person infected with coronavirus , according to an airline spokesperson . 
Upon arrival , the family was taken to a hospital in Beijing , where Li was confirmed infected with the virus on March 13 . 
She is now being treated in hospital while her husband and son stay under quarantine for medical observation . 
But in the past week , contradicting claims have emerged . 
Nieng Yan , a professor at Princeton University , said on the social platform Weibo that Li had already tested positive in the US and had wanted to " escape " back to China -- contradicting Li 's claims that she had been unable to get tested in Massachusetts . 
The police say they are investigating Li for alleged violation of China 's infectious disease prevention law .
