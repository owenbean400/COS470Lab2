China is struggling to return to work after the coronavirus outbreak shut down large swaths of the world 's second biggest economy for more than two weeks . 
Worker shortages , transport disruption , a lack of medical supplies and heavy handed local officials are all making life difficult for businesses , the Chinese government said Tuesday . 
Senior officials in Beijing were speaking to reporters a day after an extended public holiday ended for much of the country , leading some businesses to try to reopen their doors . 
Others , though , remain closed , and local governments have issued mixed — and in some cases muddled — guidance about what companies should be doing .
