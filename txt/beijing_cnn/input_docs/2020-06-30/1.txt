The United Nations Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution by virtual vote Wednesday , calling on countries to adopt a halt in hostilities to focus on the Covid 19 virus , according to a draft of the resolution seen by CNN . 
Almost four months after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic on March 11 , this is the first action by the UN wing tasked with protecting international peace and security . 
The council was widely denounced for failing to agree on any action as more than 10 million people contracted the virus and various wars continued over several months . 
A hot dispute between China and the US blocked agreement for months . 
The US wanted no mention of WHO and China was furious when the US insisted on blaming Beijing for the virus in the early months of the negotiations . 
There is no mention of WHO in the final draft resolution . 
The resolution does call for " a general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations on its agenda and supports the efforts undertaken by the Secretary General . " 
It says a ceasefire of at least 90 days would help " enable the safe , unhindered and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance " during the coronavirus outbreak . 
The fight against ISIS and terrorism in Iraq is exempt . 
Despite more than 100 countries agreeing with the goal , the UN has acknowledged the impact of the call by UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres for a ceasefire due to the virus has not had a dramatic impact . 
The vote is taking place over a two day period and will be conducted virtually due to the closure of the council chamber months ago when the outbreak hit . 
The results will be read after 11:30 a.m . ET Wednesday .
