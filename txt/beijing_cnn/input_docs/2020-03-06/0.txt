A strict ban on the consumption and farming of wild animals is being rolled out across China in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic , which is believed to have started at a wildlife market in the city of Wuhan . 
Although it is unclear which animal transferred the virus to humans -- bat , snake and pangolin have all been suggested -- China has acknowledged it needs to bring its lucrative wildlife industry under control if it is to prevent another outbreak . 
In late February , it slapped a temporary ban on all farming and consumption of " terrestrial wildlife of important ecological , scientific and social value , " which is expected to be signed into law later this year . 
But ending the trade will be hard : The cultural roots of China 's use of wild animals run deep , not just for food but also for traditional medicine , clothing , ornaments and even pets . 
This is not the first time Chinese officials have tried to contain the trade . 
In 2003 , civets -- mongoose type creatures -- were banned and culled in large numbers after it was discovered they likely transferred the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) virus to humans . 
The selling of snakes was also briefly banned in Guangzhou after the SARS outbreak . 
But today dishes using the animals are still eaten in parts of China . 
Public health experts say the ban is an important first step , but are calling on Beijing to seize this crucial opportunity to close loopholes -- such as the use of wild animals in traditional Chinese medicine -- and begin to change cultural attitudes in China around consuming wildlife .
