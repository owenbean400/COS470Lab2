Beijing is rolling out smart bracelets to measure the body temperature of students who have returned to class as schools gradually reopen in the city , according to Chinese state media . 
The bracelets are equipped with a sensor that can monitor students â€™ real time body temperature and send out an alert if an abnormal temperature is detected , the government run Beijing Daily reported on Monday . 
The readings from the devices can be monitored by teachers on their smartphones after connecting via Bluetooth on a mobile app , the report said . 
The data can also be shared with parents and municipal and district authorities , it added . 
The devices allow students to have their temperature taken without interrupting their studies , helping them to focus their attention on studying and preparing for exams , the report said , citing the Beijing education bureau . 
The scheme has so far been rolled out for final year high school and middle school students in five districts of Beijing , the report said .
