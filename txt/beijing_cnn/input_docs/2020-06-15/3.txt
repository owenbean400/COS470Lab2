Health officials in Beijing are working to trace around 200,000 people who visited a wholesale seafood market which is at the centre of a major coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese capital . 
The city has reported more than 79 new coronavirus cases since last Thursday , most of which are linked to the Xinfadi food market . 
Authorities are trying to trace all those who have visited the site since May 30 . 
The market is a key source of food supplies in the city , and has been shut down in the aftermath of the outbreak . 
At least 11 neighborhoods surrounding the area have also been sealed off . 
Xinfadi market makes up about 80 % of Beijing â€™s entire farm produce supply . 
Some 18,000 tons of vegetables and 20,000 tons of fruit are at the market every day , according to Chinese state run media organization CGTN . 
Wang Hongcun , a Beijing city government official , said authorities were working to guarantee food supplies for the city in the wake of the market 's closure . 
China said on Monday that it was in close communications with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) regarding the latest outbreak . 
Zhao said he did not have any information on whether Chinese health officials have shared the gene sequencing from the latest cluster of cases in Beijing with the WHO .
