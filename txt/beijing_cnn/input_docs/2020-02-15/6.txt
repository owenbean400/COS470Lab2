With coronavirus cases continuing to rise in mainland China , many people are locking themselves at home . 
And those who do go out , are not taking any chances . 
The Beijing South Railway Station today is filled with travelers wearing face masks , lab goggles , plastic ponchos , plastic visors , and other creative means of shielding themselves from potential infection . 
Most people avoid sitting next to each other , instead sitting one or several empty seats away to minimize close contact . 
Many are also wearing plastic and rubber gloves , and some form of head covering -- be it a hat , hood , or shower cap . 
The extra precautions come as Beijing authorities order all people returning to the capital to stay at home , or under observation , for 14 days , in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus , according to China â€™s state run news agency Xinhua .
