Beijing 's municipal government has announced tightened quarantine rules targeting international arrivals , amid a growing number of imported cases in the Chinese capital . 
Starting immediately , anyone arriving in Beijing from overseas will be required to self quarantine at home or designated facilities for 14 days . 
Previously , only people arriving from " high risk " regions were mandated to do so . 
International business travelers can only stay at designated hotels in Beijing and have to be tested for the coronavirus . 
They are not allowed to leave their hotels before receiving test results . 
The city has cordoned off a wing of Terminal 3 at its massive Capital International Airport to screen and register all international arrivals . 
The authorities have also set up a transportation hub at an exhibition center near the airport , deploying a dedicated fleet of cars to drive arriving passengers to their homes or facilities for medical observation . 
Beijing 's Capital airport is the world 's second busiest , with more than 100 million travelers passing through its three terminals last year , of which more than 26 million were international passengers . 
On Tuesday , Beijing reported six new confirmed cases of the coronavirus , all of which were imported cases , including five from Italy and one from the United States .
