Beijing 's government has locked down two construction sites after three workers tested positive for Covid 19 , a city official told a press briefing Monday . 
Three cases were identified after the city conducted nucleic acid tests on workers who either went to or had close ties with those who visited Xinfadi market , said Ding Sheng , deputy director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing . 
Xinfadi market is at the center of a new cluster of infections in the Chinese capital . 
Ding added that 1,622 construction workers , from 435 construction sites across the city , have undergone the tests . 
So far , three of them have returned positive , and the two unspecified construction sites where they work have now been locked down . 
Since June 11 , Beijing has reported 236 cases of Covid 19 , according to a statement by the Beijing Municipal Health Commission Monday . 
City on alert : For a while at least , Beijing seemed to have all but moved on from the coronavirus pandemic . 
For 55 days , the Chinese capital had not reported any locally transmitted infections and life had been returning to normal . 
Businesses and schools reopened , people went back to work , and the city 's public transports and parks were once again teeming with crowds . 
But that facade of normality was shattered , when a new set of cases emerged from the sprawling wholesale food market . 
The flare up of infections in Beijing , the seat of Communist Party power and previously considered among the country 's safest cities , is a stark reminder of how easily the virus can come back to haunt places where it was thought to have been tamed .
