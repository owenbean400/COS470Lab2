New numbers from China 's top health body revised down an earlier death toll from Hubei province after saying duplications had been found in " data collection and recording . " 
According to the National Health Commission , the current number of infections in mainland China is 63,851 , up 5,090 from the day before , while the death toll has risen to 1,380 . 
In total , that brings the global total to at least 1,383 deaths and 64,435 confirmed infections . 
Previous numbers released out of Hubei province this morning had suggested that the number of infected had climbed above 65,000 but Beijing now says that is incorrect .
