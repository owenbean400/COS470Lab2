The Chinese government is considering delaying its annual meeting of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , a gathering of the the country 's nearly 3,000 national legislators , as the government continues to deal with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak , Chinese state media reported . 
The annual meeting is a highly choreographed political and propaganda spectacle that ranks high on the ruling Communist Party ’s agenda . 
The annual plenary session has not been delayed or suspended since the end of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s . 
It went as scheduled in 2003 amid the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) epidemic , which originated in China and hit the country hard . 
SARS eventually spread across the world to infect more than 8,000 people , killing at least 774 . 
The full session of the NPC was due to open on March 5 . 
Instead , the NPC Standing Committee , a smaller group of fewer than 200 people , will meet in the capital on February 24 to review a proposal to postpone the plenary session , according to state run news agency Xinhua . 
The proposal to delay the NPC ’s full gathering is aimed to " ensure concentrated energy on the containment effort , and to ensure the safety and health of the masses , " Zang added .
