Beijing will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest level starting on April 30 , according to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission . 
The capital will move from the country â€™s highest designation of " level one " to " level two , " out of a three tier system . 
In a statement released on Wednesday , the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said that despite the downgrading of the emergency response level , prevention and control work will not be relaxed . 
Under the lowered emergency response level travellers arriving in Beijing from " low risk areas " within China will no longer have to be quarantined for two weeks upon arrival and people staying in hotels in Beijing will no longer have to undergo nucleic acid testing . 
However , the Commission added that the 14 day quarantine still applies to all international travellers arriving in Beijing from overseas , according to state run CGTN . 
Beijing has not reported any new cases of locally transmitted Covid 19 for 13 days .
