The toll of the coronavirus is clearly visible across China and its territories as the outbreak continues to spread . 
In densely populated major cities like Beijing , streets that are normally bustling are now almost empty . 
Public transit like buses and subway cars have noticeably fewer people -- especially for this time of year , after the Lunar New Year , a typically busy period . 
In Hong Kong , shops are mostly closed , schools are suspended , and employees have been told to work from home . 
Afraid of catching the virus , many have decided to barricade themselves at home . 
Pharmacies and stores have found themselves sold out of supplies , with long lines forming outside as residents stock up . 
That 's not to say the city is entirely deserted now . 
Some people are going on with daily life , buying groceries , walking around , playing Chinese chess in the park -- just all wearing the now ubiquitous face mask .
