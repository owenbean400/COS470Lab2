Anyone with a fever seeking treatment at any Beijing medical facility will be tested for Covid 19 , a spokesperson for the Beijing health commission said Sunday . 
Medical facilities will be required to conduct nucleic acid tests , antibody tests , blood tests and CT scans on these patients . 
The measures were announced after Beijing ’s health commission confirmed 43 cases linked to Xinfadi market , the largest agricultural market in Beijing . 
The new cases broke the city ’s 56 day record of no new coronavirus cases . 
Residential communities , restaurants and other places linked to the market will be required to conduct screenings on personnel , food and their environment , according to city officials . 
All employees of Xinfadi market , as well as residents of the local neighborhood , will be tested and put under medical observation . 
Wu Zunyou , the top epidemiologist from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , said the outbreak was likely linked to contaminated seafood or meat , according to the state run news agency Xinhua . 
Because Beijing has not had a locally transmitted case in over 50 days , the virus should theoretically not exist there , Zunyou says .
