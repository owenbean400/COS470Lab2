Beijing will downgrade its public health emergency response level from level two to level three , as it continues to report a low number of Covid 19 infections , the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said in a statement Friday . 
These are the new measures : Starting on Saturday , Beijing will lift entry restrictions for Hubei residents – the initial epicenter of the Covid 19 pandemic – as long as they have tested negative in the nucleic acid test . 
All international arrivals to Beijing will continue taking a mandatory nucleic acid test and stay under medical observation for 14 days after entry . 
Authorities will also begin to relax restrictions for domestic tourism in Beijing . 
According to the Chinese government , the country has a four tier public health emergency management system , with level four being the lowest level . 
Some background : To prevent a surge in cross border infections , Beijing announced in mid March the enforcement of a 14 day quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the Chinese capital . 
They are mandated to self quarantine , either at home or in a designated facility for two complete weeks . 
International business travelers are required to stay at a select number of designated hotels in Beijing , where they are tested for the virus . 
They are not permitted to leave until the test results have returned .
