Cna is delaying the annual gathering of nearly 3,000 national legislators in Beijing , according to state media . 
The National People ’s Congress ’ Standing Committee voted today to delay the plenary session , which was due to open March 5 . 
No new date has been announced . 
Why this is significant : The National People ’s Congress ( NPC ) is the country ’s rubber stamp parliament . 
The annual plenary session , one of the biggest political events each year , has not been delayed or suspended since the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s . 
It went ahead as scheduled in 2003 amid the SARS epidemic , which originated in China and hit the country hard . 
SARS eventually spread across the world to infect more than 8,000 people , killing at least 774 .
