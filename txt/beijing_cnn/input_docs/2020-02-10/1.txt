Chinese President Xi Jinping inspected efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus in the capital Beijing on Monday , the first time he has appeared on the front lines of the fight against the outbreak . 
Wearing a protective face mask , Xi visited a specially built center in the city 's Chaoyang district , according to state broadcaster CCTV . 
The capital is gradually getting back to work Monday , after the Lunar New Year holiday became an extended voluntary quarantine for millions of people across the country . 
Xi has been strangely missing in recent weeks , not appearing on front pages or CCTV 's main news broadcasts , which he usually dominates even if his activities are barely newsworthy . 
Speculation is rife about just why Xi has taken such a backseat visually , even as state media has been keen to emphasize that he has been guiding all efforts from behind the scenes . 
The most convincing theory is that China 's propaganda apparatus is trying to thread the needle of having Xi receive the credit for successful measures against the virus , while not catching any blame or fallout from myriad missteps , particularly in Wuhan .
