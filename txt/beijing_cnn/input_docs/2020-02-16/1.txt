Police in Beijing are calling residents and asking about their travel history , as the Chinese capital introduces strict lockdown measures to contain the novel coronavirus . 
On Sunday afternoon , I was called by an officer from my local police station , who asked for my travel history prior to the recent Lunar New Year holiday . 
He also asked about my health and whether I 'd had contact with people from Hubei , the province at the center of the outbreak . 
The police officer said the authorities are calling every person in my neighborhood with a Beijing address but not a Beijing hukou , or household registration -- that 's an easy way of identifying people who come from elsewhere in the country and , therefore , may have traveled back home during the Lunar New Year . 
There are over 7.6 million non Beijing hukou holders in Beijing , meaning if this procedure is being carried out in every district , police could be making millions of phone calls .
