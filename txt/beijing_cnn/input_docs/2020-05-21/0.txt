US President Donald Trump took to Twitter again tonight to criticize China 's response to the coronavirus outbreak , saying , " It all comes from the top . " 
This is as far as he â€™s gone in calling out Chinese President Xi Jinping , although Trump still is not naming the Chinese leader directly . 
" They could have easily stopped the plague , but they did not , " the tweet said . 
Trump then goes on to more familiar claims that China wants presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to win the 2020 US election because he would not be as tough as him on Beijing .
