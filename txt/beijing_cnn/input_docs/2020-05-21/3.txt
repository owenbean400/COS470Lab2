China â€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lashed out at US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo amid a growing war of words between Beijing and Washington . 
Zhao also questioned the US response to the coronavirus pandemic , asking " why did not the US government take any prevention measures from January through til March , why did it advise people not wear masks for so long , why did it fail to stem the spread of virus [ ? ] . " 
Tensions over the pandemic and trade have reignited tensions between the US and China in recent weeks . 
The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it had approved another potential arms sale to Taiwan . 
Zhao said in response : " China is firmly opposed to the US arms sales to Taiwan and has made solemn representations to the US . 
We urge the US side to strictly abide by the one China principle and the provisions of the three Sino US joint communiques , and stop arms sales to Taiwan and military links between the United States and Taiwan to avoid further damage to Sino US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait . " 
President Trump criticized China 's response to the pandemic in a series of tweets posted late Wednesday night , accusing Beijing of " trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world . " 
He claimed the Chinese government " could have easily stopped the plague , but they did not ! "
