Victor Vincent is one of around 50 Nigerian students living in Wuhan -- the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak -- who say they 've been abandoned by their country , their repeated pleas for evacuation and medical supplies largely ignored by government officials . 
The students say they , along with over a dozen other Nigerian teachers and businesspeople living in Hubei province , have repeatedly written and called Nigerian government officials requesting assistance . 
But they say very little has been forthcoming in return . 
Many countries , including the US , the UK and Japan , are working to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan . 
Nigeria is yet to take such a step . 
Requests for evacuation , medical supplies : As well as evacuation , Vincent , who is an executive of the Nigerian Students in Wuhan Association , said they 've asked the government for medical supplies , such as masks , goggles , gloves and disinfectant . 
Money for food : The association received a grant of 20,000 yuan ( $ 2,870 ) from the Nigerian ambassador to China last Thursday . 
The money was provided to " assist us in procuring foodstuffs and medical supplies , " Vincent said . 
Chances of evacuation slip by : " Other than that , the situation remains the same . 
We still have no clear indication on when we are getting evacuation , where we will be quarantined or even if that will happen at all , " Vincent said . 
CNN reached out to the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to the Nigerian embassy in Beijing , but has not received a response .
