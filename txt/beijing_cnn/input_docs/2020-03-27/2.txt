India went under a nationwide total lockdown on Wednesday , with foreign citizens given only hours to figure out travel and accommodation plans . 
Those who are still there now face home quarantines and difficulties finding places to stay . 
Erin Vaeth , a 26 year old American who resides in Beijing , was in the Indian city of Pushkar when the restrictions were announced . 
On Saturday , she was told she could not stay at her hotel without getting a medical checkup first -- so she went to a medical office , standing in line with dozens of other foreigners in the same situation . 
She was given a note of approval , and told to check into a hostel -- where , the next day , all the guests had their wrist stamped with the words " home quarantined , " and told they could not leave the hostel . 
They 're being cared for by hostel staff , she said -- but food is being rationed , and rising prices are getting out of hand . 
Total lockdown : The lockdown is in place across all of India 's 36 states and territories , affecting 1.3 billion people , for a minimum of 21 days .
