My colleague Kim Willsher has passed along some good news from the Pasteur Institute in Paris , which announced at the weekend that it had managed to isolate and grow a culture of this coronavirus . 
That means it is available for research , which puts scientists on track to develop a vaccine . 
However , that is not a quick process . 
Christophe D â€™Enfert , a scientific director with the Pasteur Institute , told reporters in Paris the vaccine could be made available in 20 months if " all goes well " . 
" At the end of August , we could enter clinical trials and , provided all goes well , obtain a vaccine candidate within 20 months , " he said . 
In other positive developments this morning , tests on 20 French passengers on a second plane of 36 people repatriated from Wuhan on Sunday have come back negative . 
They will still be held in 14 day quarantine , a junior health minister said . 
A French government spokesperson said all those French citizens who had asked to be brought back to France had now returned .
