Inspectors in protective suits have been going door to door in Wuhan in an effort to find every infected person , the Associated Press reports . 
Wednesday marked the final day of a campaign to root out anyone with symptoms whom authorities may have missed so far . 
" This must be taken seriously , " said Wang Zhonglin , the city ’s new Communist party secretary , adding that if a single new case was found after Wednesday , the district ’s leaders would be held responsible . 
His remarks were published on Hubei ’s provincial website alongside a declaration that " if the masses cannot mobilise , it ’s impossible to fight a people ’s war . "
