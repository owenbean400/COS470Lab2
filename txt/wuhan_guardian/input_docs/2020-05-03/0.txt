The US secretary of state , Mike Pompeo , claimed on Sunday there is " enormous evidence " the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory – but did not provide any of the alleged evidence . 
Pompeo ’s claims , made in an interview with ABC ’s This Week , represented an escalation in rhetoric . 
He had previously said the US was looking into the possibility the virus came from a lab in Wuhan , China . 
On Sunday , Pompeo said : " There is enormous evidence that that ’s where this began , " later adding : " I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan . " 
At one point , the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars Co V 2 virus ( which causes the Covid 19 disease ) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident . 
" Look , the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade . 
I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point , " he said . 
But when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite – that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified – Pompeo replied : " That ’s right . 
I agree with that . "
