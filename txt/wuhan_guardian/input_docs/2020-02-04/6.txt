More Britons have been contacting the Guardian with their responses to the Foreign Office ’s call for them to leave China . 
David , a teacher and poet in Shanghai , who preferred to keep his surname private , said : The announcement by Dominic Raab has certainly caused a stir , but feels particularly like something said as though in order to get excuses in early . 
The UK government was strongly criticised for its lamentable handling of the evacuations from Wuhan , and it ’s announcement today feels a bit like " leave , because we wo not come and help you " . 
For many of us this has put us in an impossible position . 
I ’m gay , my partner is Chinese . 
We met in the UK and have been together many years , but we are not married . 
It would be very unlikely he ’d be able to leave China with me – and I ca not exactly see our government handing out visas to partners and dependants . 
It ’s all a bit of a shocker really . 
Tom Styles , a teacher at a language school in Huizhou , Guangdong province , said : I ’ve lived in China for the past 7 years ... and myself and fellow Brits have been left baffled by today ’s announcement by Dominic Raab . 
It seemed such a generic blanket statement ... 
How long should we go back for ? 
What to do about our jobs ( all of which have been very understanding and supportive giving us updates , free masks , advice etc ) . 
Why now ? 
There seems to be no great spike in numbers compared to previous days , do they know something we do not ? 
Unless there ’s a good reason for this it does not help with the general sense of paranoia at the moment and will add further worry to our friends and family back home .
