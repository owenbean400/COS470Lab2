Canada is preparing to repatriate about 300 of its citizens from Wuhan this Thursday , a Canadian government source has told Reuters . 
Canadians in the city received an email from their government â€™s foreign ministry saying a plane was expected to leave on 6 February , according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . 
However , a Canadian government source said the Chinese government had yet to give final consent for the flight , Reuters says . 
Residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been under quarantine for a few weeks as China attempts to contain the spread of the virus . 
According to a portion of the letter the CBC posted online , not everyone who is eligible for a seat will get one . 
Canadian evacuees will be flown first to Vancouver , where the plane will refuel , and then on to Trenton Air Force base in southern Ontario , where they will be placed in quarantine for 14 days .
