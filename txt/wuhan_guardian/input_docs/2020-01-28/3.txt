Taiwan has raised its travel warning for China , saying people should avoid going unless absolutely necessary amid an outbreak of the new coronavirus there , Reuters reports . 
The island has reported seven confirmed cases of the virus so far . 
Taiwan ’s central epidemic command centre said it had raised its previous advice and would extend to the rest of China an existing warning not to go to Hubei province unless totally necessary , though Hong Kong and Macau are excluded . 
Taiwan also has rolled out strict curbs on Chinese visitors , restricting a vast majority of them . 
Last week , Taiwan ’s government announced a one month ban on the export of specialist masks designed to be used for medical personnel , saying it had to look after the needs of its own people first . 
Some pharmacies in Taiwan have reported shortages of face masks since the island reported its first case a week ago , and the government says it is working to ensure supplies . 
In a separate notice on Tuesday , the government said it would release more stock of masks , but limit each person to buying a maximum of three . 
However , it also issued a reminder that most healthy people do not need to wear masks all the time . 
The Taiwanese president , Tsai Ing wen , visiting people on Tuesday to extend lunar new year wishes , said the government was fully prepared to deal with the virus and people should not panic . 
" Our anti epidemic work does not take holidays , and is taking place 24 hours a day , " the presidential office quoted her as saying .
