Fears have been raised that many of the British nationals registered for the evacuation flight from Wuhan tomorrow morning may not actually be able to make it to the airport to catch the plane . 
The Guardian was contacted by Robert Dowling , from Nottingham , whose 22 year old son is in Wuhan and had been due to get the flight . 
But Dowling â€™s son lives on the other side of the city , south of the Yangtze river which intersects it , and , with the entire city on lockdown , there is no means of travel to reach the airport . 
The Foreign Office , Dowling said , is not helping Britons with their travel through Wuhan . 
He told the Guardian : [ My son ] did phone up the Foreign Office for advice . 
They told him to go to the local police station to ask for transport . 
He did that and the police told him to phone the embassy . 
On the group chat [ on social media between British nationals in Wuhan ] this is a constant theme with it sounds like quite a number of them not at all sure how they are going to get to the airport . 
I have just spoken myself to the FCO and the person there was still saying that as far as he knew there was not meant to be any assistance in reaching the airport other than to send [ Britons in Wuhan ] an email to show to the road blocks . 
The Guardian has contacted the Foreign Office for comment .
