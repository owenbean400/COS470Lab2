The BMJ ( British Medical Journal ) has an article about the psychological effects of quarantining a city , in response to the lockdown affecting more than 20 million people in China . 
It says : While history reminds us that outright panic is unlikely , fear seems more certain as a consequence of mass quarantine . 
Anxiety within Wuhan is to be expected even without quarantine . 
During disease outbreaks , community anxiety can rise following the first death , increased media reporting and an escalating number of new cases . 
Mass quarantine is likely to raise that substantially , for multiple reasons . 
It says elevated anxiety may lead to a surge in patients referred to as the " worried well " and that stigma may affect those on the inside of the cordon . 
Previous incidents have seen residents of affected areas socially shunned , discriminated against in the workplace and their property attacked . 
Unless active steps are taken to prevent this , the official imposition of a cordon may aggravate such effects . 
Vigilante imposed isolation can follow or even run ahead of official quarantine .
