The US has questioned China ’s credibility on reporting fresh coronavirus cases in Beijing and called for neutral observers to assess the extent of the outbreak . 
China has locked down the capital as it seeks to prevent a second wave of Covid 19 , reporting 158 cases since a fresh cluster was detected last week . 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , an outspoken critic of China , urged greater transparency during talks Wednesday in Hawaii with senior Chinese official Yang Jiechi . 
" I would hope that their numbers and their reporting are more accurate than what we saw in the case of Wuhan and other places in the PRC , but that remains to be seen , " said David Stilwell , the top US diplomat for East Asia who accompanied Pompeo . 
" As far as numbers , it would be good to have folks on the ground to get confirmation " in Beijing , he told reporters . 
Stilwell pointed to reports in scientific journals that gave higher estimates for Covid 19 cases in Wuhan , the metropolis where the global pandemic was first detected late last year . 
" So once your credibility is lost , you will have to find a way to re establish that , " Stilwell said . 
" I think the only way to do that is by bringing in neutral observers to help understand exactly what happened there . " 
China has accused President Donald Trump ’s administration of politicising the pandemic to deflect from its own handling of the virus in the US , which has suffered by far the highest death toll of any country .
