The UK evacuation of its citizens out of Wuhan is underway . 
They are understood to be on Wamos Air 747 . 
According to Flightradar24 , a Wamos air 747 flew from Hanoi to Wuhan on 31 January , landing in Wuhan at 04.45 local time . 
We know from the video we posted a short time ago that UK citizens were preparing to board a Wamos air plane . 
I have not yet got any information as to whether that plane has left Wuhan as there is sometimes a lag in this being uploaded . 
We know that passengers were ready to board
