They are taking questions from the media now . 
Q . Will anyone flying into UK airports be quarantined for 14 days from the start of next month ? 
Why did not this happen weeks ago during the peak and wo not such a move damage the aviation industry even more ? 
Shapps says people travelling from Wuhan , Iran and South Korea were quarantined in January and February . 
It makes sense to look at the borders , he says , but the capacity to do this exists but the PM will say more on this tomorrow . 
Van Tam adds that the incubation period of this disease is understood to be between one and 14 days . 
This means from exposure to the virus , you remain well for one to 14 days before symptoms emerge . 
If people go home , they must work out that incubation period at home , and that ’s the scientific basis for quarantine . 
Q . Is the government ’s messaging now looking more confused as you ’re looking at tightening controls on the borders yet allowing people to visit garden centres ? 
Shapps says he feels people are capable of understanding what ’s being said . 
Van Tam adds that the policy is quite consistent . 
Testing and tracing means contacts will be told to self isolate , consistent with quarantining people travelling in from abroad , he says .
