The health secretary , Matt Hancock , has responded to the news that all but one of the UK â€™s nine coronavirus patients have been discharged from hospital and the release of quarantined returnees from China . 
He said : As the last group leave supported isolation in the Wirral today , I want to express my thanks for their patience in these unique circumstances . 
The overwhelming gratitude expressed by those who left earlier this week is a testament to the exceptional support and tireless dedication of our NHS in trying circumstances . 
I am also pleased that 8 of the 9 individuals who tested positive for coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital . 
Again , this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus . 
I want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public .
