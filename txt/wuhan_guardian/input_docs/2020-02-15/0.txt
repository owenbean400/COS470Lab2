My colleague , Lily Kuo , has written a heart wrenching piece detailing the story of a 25 year old Chinese woman who could only look on as her relatives were ravaged by the virus . 
Liu Mengdi has been keeping a diary of the past few weeks about the impact of coronavirus in her home town of Wuhan , but has now been warned to stop posting about the trauma . 
Writing movingly in her diary about her 90 year old grandfather â€™s death , Mengdi recorded : " Grandpa really is strong . 
We knew he must have been in a lot of pain , but he still insisted and pretended he was fine . 
Before his results could come back , he could not hold on any more and closed his eyes for the last time . "
