The European Commission has granted " conditional marketing authorization " for remdesivir as a treatment for coronavirus infection , Gilead Sciences , the company that makes the Covid 19 drug , announced in a press release on Friday morning . 
The authorization , based on a review of scientific data that dates back to April , means that the drug will be indicated in Europe for the treatment of Covid 19 in adults and adolescents ages 12 and older or weighing at least 40 kilograms , who have pneumonia that requires oxygen support . 
Gilead noted in the release that the conditional marketing authorization is initially valid for one year but can be extended or converted into an unconditional authorization once additional data are submitted and assessed . 
" Ongoing clinical trials continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir , including studies of remdesivir in combination with anti inflammatory medicines and in special populations including pediatric patients , " the press release said . 
" Research is also being conducted on new , investigational formulations of remdesivir that may enable studies of remdesivir in earlier stages of disease . " 
Remember : Previous research has shown separately that severely and moderately ill patients with pneumonia from Covid 19 who received a course of remdesivir were more likely to have clinical improvement after 11 days compared to those who received traditional standard of care alone , according to Gilead . 
In the United States , remdesivir — currently administered intravenously through infusions — is the only drug that has an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus infections . 
Gilead originally studied remdesivir as a potential treatment for Ebola , but lab experiments suggested it might be active against the coronavirus that causes Covid 19 .
