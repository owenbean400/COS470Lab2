European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson has urged European countries to apply " as wide a definition of partnerships as possible " to exempt the " partner or ‘ sweetheart ’ , " of an EU citizen from EU coronavirus travel restrictions . 
The EU published on Tuesday a set of guidelines that allows for the gradual reopening of Europe ’s external borders starting July 1 . 
The guidelines , which are primarily based on health criteria and preventing a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic , define a " family member " as a spouse , a registered partnership equivalent to marriage , children or dependents under the age of 21 and dependent direct relatives . 
However , there is space for change in the guidelines and specific categories of travelers " may be reviewed by the Council , in close consultation with the Commission , " based on " social and economic considerations as well as the overall assessment of the evolution of the epidemiological situation . " 
Denmark had already expanded its definition of traveller with a " worthy purpose " to include " boyfriends/girlfriends , fiancées , grandparents and grandchildren , as well as business travel , job interviews , " in the list of those able to journey to the country . 
This is news social media campaigners using the hashtags # Love Is Essential and # Love Is Not Tourism have welcomed , like German/American boyfriend and girlfriend Eglain and Zuri . 
American Zuri wrote on her social media : " It feels like I woke up to a hopeful miracle . 
I hope this is step in the right direction for couples separated by this travel ban . " 
Her German boyfriend Eglain also took to social media , writing : " The head of European home affairs is supporting our cause of reuniting binational couples separated by travel bans ! " 
Adding German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas to his tweet , Eglain added , " Now the member states need to act and implement exemptions for us . "
