Only 45 % of passengers intend to fly within two months of the pandemic subsiding , compared to 61 % in early April , the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) said on Tuesday . 
According to a survey carried out by IATA , overall bookings are down 82 % on 2019 levels and demand for long haul travel remains close to zero . 
Normally , airlines would have sold 14 % of tickets for winter at this point in the year but IATA said passengers are booking tickets much closer to the date of departure . 
As travel in Europe is restarting IATA , expressed again the need for an extension of the slot waiver into the winter season to give " fragile " airlines the flexibility they need to focus on meeting passenger demand as it evolves . 
The association also called for Covid 19 testing government collaboration , emphasizing it is by far a preferred alternative to quarantine measures . 
" We have seen a few countries , like Iceland , implement testing on arrival as an alternative to quarantine . 
The point to emphasize here is that testing before departure would be much more efficient . 
It would keep people who test positive completely out of the travel system . 
The challenge , however , is for governments to work together so that testing data from the departure location is accepted by the arrival state , " said de Juniac .
