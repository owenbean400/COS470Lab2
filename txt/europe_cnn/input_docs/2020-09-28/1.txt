Numerous scientists have studied how the 1918 flu spread to become the deadliest pandemic in history and which interventions worked , research that is becoming increasingly relevant during the current coronavirus crisis . 
But little research has been done on how environmental conditions affected the 1918 pandemic -- until now . 
The 1918 flu coincided with the final years of the World War I , and it 's been well documented that heavy rain and cold temperatures impacted many battles . 
Now , a new study reveals that the cold , rainy weather was part of a once in a century climate anomaly that occurred from 1914 to 1919 and added to the severity of the 1918 pandemic . 
A team of more than a dozen scientists collected and analyzed an Alpine ice core to reconstruct the environmental conditions of Europe during the World War I . 
The process involves using a laser that melts a tiny bit from the ice surface and analyzing the chemicals released from each layer of water vapor . 
It 's so precise they can pinpoint exact seasons from each layer of ice . 
Researchers then compared that ice core data to historical records of deaths during that time period and records of precipitation and temperatures from each month . 
The researchers discovered that lingering cold , wet weather during the winters of 1915 , 1916 and 1918 was caused by abnormally high rushes of marine air from the North Atlantic . 
Deaths in Europe peaked three times during World War I and all the spikes occurred during or soon after heavy rain and cold weather , according to the study .
