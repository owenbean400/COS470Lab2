Nepal has become the latest country to ban entry to passengers traveling from or transiting through the United Kingdom , in response to fears over a new variant of coronavirus detected in Europe . 
" There are no direct flights from Nepal to the UK , so we are not concerned about passengers who would be traveling from Nepal to the UK . 
We have banned only incoming traffic so that the virus does not enter Nepal , " said Bikram Gautam , the authority 's deputy director . 
The restrictions come into force from 11:59 p.m . on December 23 , and will be valid until further notice . 
International flights to Nepal resumed in September , but at a reduced capacity , and tourists ' entry into the country remains restricted , Gautam added .
