The World Health Organization 's Europe director has called for action against Covid 19 " fatigue , " warning that apathy concerning the virus has reached high levels in some cases . 
" Based on aggregated survey data from countries across the Region , we can see , not surprisingly , that fatigue among those surveyed is increasing , " Hans Kluge said in a statement Tuesday . 
Kluge said that " these levels of fatigue are to be expected " during such a protracted public health emergency , where citizens have made " huge sacrifices . " 
" Although we are all weary , I believe it is possible to reinvigorate and revive efforts to tackle the evolving COVID 19 challenges that we face , " he said . 
Europe can take action : Kluge said European countries can reverse this trend and tackle the spread of Covid 19 by taking " the pulse of the community regularly " and " meeting the needs of citizens in new , innovative ways . " 
" From understanding the behavioral needs of young people returning to university , to the emotional toll isolation has taken in elderly care homes , policy must be driven by the growing body of evidence we have on people â€™s behaviours and on fatigue . "
