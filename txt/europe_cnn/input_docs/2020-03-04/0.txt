As speculation mounts over the fate of the Summer Olympics , a scene from iconic 1988 anime film " Akira , " which notoriously predicted Tokyo2020 , has started trending online . 
In the scene , a signboard counting down to the Tokyo Olympics shows there are only 147 days to go . 
Underneath it , there 's some graffiti in white -- the Japanese words " chuushida , " meaning " just cancel it . " 
" Just cancel it " has now gone viral on Japanese Twitter . 
Coincidentally , last Friday marked exactly 147 days until the official start of the Olympics , which is due to kick off on July 24 . 
" Akira " is a popular science fiction manga -- a Japanese word for a comic or graphic novel -- that was created in 1982 by Japanese artist Katsuhiro Otomo . 
The story follows biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda as he battles to save his friend from a secret government program that conducts tests on psychic children . 
In 1988 , Otomo released " Akira " as an anime film so detailed and intricate that it took animators years to hand paint each of the single shots to bring the story to life . 
The film is now widely considered a cult classic which helped expand anime 's reach in the US and Europe .
