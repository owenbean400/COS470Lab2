Novel coronavirus cases in Europe are " almost back " to March levels , the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) , Andrea Ammon , said on Wednesday during a debate held by EU Committee for Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . 
" The virus has not been sleeping over the summer so it did not take vacation and that is something that we see now , " Ammon said . 
She continued : " In August , now , we are seeing more that also ( an ) older population is affected , indicating that it 's really a true increase in transmission , " she added . 
Regarding schools reopenings and the risk of coronavirus spikes , Ammon said : " there are very few significant outbreaks in schools that have been documented and the evidence is really at the moment conflicting , meaning it 's very inconclusive to say whether it 's useful or not from a transmission point of view to close schools . "
