Scotland ’s coronavirus " R number " – which represents how quickly the virus is spreading – could be as high as 1.4 , First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says . 
A number at that level means that one infected person is transmitting the virus to an average of 1.4 people . 
" I said recently that the R number is of a slightly less concern when overall prevalence of the virus is low . 
And overall prevalence of the virus is still low in Scotland right now . 
But nevertheless , this is a further reminder that the virus is spreading again here just as it is elsewhere in the UK , across Europe and indeed in the wider world . "
