The United Kingdom has begun administering the first doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine outside clinical trials , launching a sprawling public health campaign to vaccinate tens of millions of people in just a matter of months . 
It marks a significant turning point in the fight against Covid 19 , months into a pandemic that has left more than 1.5 million dead . 
Margaret " Maggie " Keenan , who turns 91 next week , became the first person in the world to receive an authorized , fully vetted coronavirus vaccine . 
" It 's the best early birthday present I could wish for , " Keenan said after receiving the jab in Coventry , England , dressed in a festive " Merry Christmas " T shirt . 
" It means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year . "

Keenan and Shakespeare were among a handful of people across Britain -- those aged over 80 , nursing home staff and health care workers -- who were administered doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine on Tuesday morning , a week after the UK leapfrogged the rest of Europe and the United States to become the first Western nation to approve it .
