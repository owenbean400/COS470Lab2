Touting the actions his administration took to address coronavirus , President Trump claimed , " We closed the border to China , we put on the ban . " 
He later added , " I closed the borders from Europe . " 
Facts First : It ’s misleading for Trump to say he closed the US border to travel from China and Europe because both policies contained multiple exemptions , including for US citizens and permanent residents ; the Europe policy exempted entire countries . 
Only foreign nationals who had been in China , Europe 's Schengen area , the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the US .
