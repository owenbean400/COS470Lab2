After almost five days of fraught discussions , European Union leaders have agreed on a 750 billion euro ( almost $ 858 billion ) stimulus plan to help fund Europe 's recovery from the coronavirus crisis . 
The deal would focus on providing funding across three pillars : creating reforms to help businesses rebound from the pandemic , rolling out new measures to reform economies over the long haul , and investing to help protect from " future crises . " 
It would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in grants and loans to member states . 
The agreement came after days of deadlock and fractious talks that were described as some of the most bitterly divided in years . 
" We did it ! 
Europe is strong . 
Europe is united , " European Council President Charles Michel said at a press conference Tuesday . 
" This is a good deal , this is a strong deal , and most importantly , this is the right deal for Europe right now . " 
Michel described the occasion as the first time that members of the European Union were " jointly enforcing our economies against the crisis . " 
The commission also agreed to a core budget of 1.1 trillion euro ( nearly $ 1.3 trillion ) from 2021-2027 .
