Austria will once again make it mandatory for people to wear face masks in supermarkets , banks and post offices , Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced at a news conference on Tuesday . 
" In the past weeks , we recorded an increase of new corona infections , " Kurz tweeted after the briefing . 
He explained everyone should wear a mask " in order to protect vulnerable people . " 
During the briefing , Kurz emphasized how face masks can influence behavior , saying " the more they disappear from our everyday life , the more careless people become . " 
Since June 15 , masks have not been mandatory in Austria apart from on public transport , in hospitals , pharmacies and hair salons . 
The measure making it mandatory for mask to be worn in supermarkets , banks and post offices will go into effect on July 24 . 
According to Austria ’s Health Ministry coronavirus dashboard , 88 new Covid 19 cases were reported on July 20 . 
On the same day in June , just 20 new cases were reported . 
The country ’s total Covid 19 death toll stands at 710 , with a total of 19,827 recorded cases , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Austria — seen as a success story in Europe — went into lockdown in mid March and lifted many of its measures at the end of April . 
Kurz said on April 19 that the coronavirus outbreak in Austria was " under control . " 
He credited the positive development as a result of the government 's early implementation of strict containment measures . 
" We were one of the first countries in Europe which decided to have a complete lockdown , and I think it was extremely important that we were faster than others and our reaction was tougher than in other countries , " Kurz told CNN 's Fareed Zakaria . 
" It was good that we did it because now the situation in Austria is under control . 
We only have about 100 new infections every day , " he added . 
Austria also removed its coronavirus border controls on June 16 , with some exemptions .
