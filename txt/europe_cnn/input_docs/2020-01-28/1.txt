Today is Ben Kavanagh ’s birthday . 
The Irishman is teaching psychology in Wuhan and says he should be out at the local Irish bar in the city celebrating with friends . 
Tomorrow , he had planned on returning to Europe to do some traveling . 
He remembers first hearing about the coronavirus as " a disease similar to SARS " around December 31 . 
" Sir , can I go , I ’ve got SARS , " he remembers one student in his class saying as a joke . 
Now , he ’s trying to pass the time with Netflix and keeping in touch with friends and family . 
Kavanagh is one of 11 million Wuhan residents who are under travel restrictions . 
They are now essentially quarantined inside the city limits . 
Kavanagh went to a nearby supermarket two days ago to get enough supplies : water , pasta , hot dogs , canned food , soy milk and other non perishables . 
Except he ’s run of out of face masks , which are essential in preventing him getting the coronavirus . 
" I never had enough to begin with and the stores ran out immediately , " Kavanagh says . 
He says stores have been trying to restock , but he wo not be going outside until absolutely necessary . 
Kavanagh says he does not worry , most of the time .
