Heathrow , Europe â€™s busiest airport , wo not reopen all its terminals until next year , CEO John Holland Kaye told CNN 's Richard Quest . 
The airport may reopen Terminal 3 later this year depending on demand , he said . 
Terminal 4 will remain closed until next year . 
He said they are starting to see the slow return of passengers , but that the collapse in revenues meant the airport was coming to a point where it needed to consider jobs cuts .
