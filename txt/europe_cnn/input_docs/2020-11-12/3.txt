Irish citizens living abroad should not book travel home for Christmas as it is " too soon " and risks further spreading Covid 19 , Ireland 's deputy prime minister said Thursday . 
Covid 19 infections have fallen in Ireland since the country became the first in Europe to implement a second national lockdown on October 21 . 
The restrictions are due to ease on December 2 . 
Varadkar said the country was " ahead of projections in terms of getting the virus under control " with the average number of weekly cases being only a quarter " of what it was a few weeks ago . " But international travel and the festive season poses the risk of " reseeding " Covid 19 back into the country , he said , adding that travel from Northern Ireland could be even riskier than from Qatar or Miami . 
Ireland has reported 66,247 overall cases and 1,965 deaths . 
Neighboring Northern Ireland has a total of 44,693 cases and 810 deaths despite having a population of just 1.88 million compared to Ireland 's 4.9 million .
