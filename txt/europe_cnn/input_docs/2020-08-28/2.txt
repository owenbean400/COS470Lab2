French President Emmanuel Macron has called for greater coordination within the European Union on coronavirus restrictions and border regulations , asserting that it would be " absurd " to impose tougher border restrictions within the bloc . 
" It makes no sense to close the borders between two countries when there are outbreaks of infection , areas of active circulation , which are well identified . 
There is a need for a common methodology to define these areas of active circulation , and to address them within each country , " Macron said Friday . 
Speaking during a televised address on Friday , the French President urged his European partners to focus on developing a unified approach which " allows Europe to not to be at a standstill " as a result of the pandemic . 
" There is still progress to be made to improve coordination . 
Let 's not repeat the mistakes of March in this regard , it is counterproductive and , above all , it is ineffective in the fight against the virus and its spread , " Macron said .
