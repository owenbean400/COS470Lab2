The UK has increased the self isolation period for anyone who potentially has the coronavirus to 10 days , according to a statement from the UK Chief Medical Officers Thursday . 
In order to reduce the risk to the general population , " it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self isolation period from 7 to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result , " the statement said . 
" This will help provide additional protection to others in the community . 
This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission , " the statement said . 
Earlier on Thursday , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was concerned about the rising infection rates in other countries in Europe , saying : " I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe , and we 've got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores , and to tackle it . " 
England has dramatically eased its lockdown measures and allowed the re opening of gyms , pools , restaurants and pubs . 
The government has also urged those who can return to the workplace to do so .
