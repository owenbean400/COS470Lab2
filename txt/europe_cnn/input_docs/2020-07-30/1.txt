Italy ’s Health Minister warned on Thursday that Europe ’s battle against coronavirus has not been won as the continent braces for a possible second wave with infection rates rising in several countries . 
In a statement , Roberto Speranza said he was concerned by the " latest signals from France , Spain and Germany that still tell us the battle has not been won , not even in Europe , " adding that Italians need to act with " strength of prudence . " 
Italy was the first European country to see a wave of coronavirus infections and its northern province of Lombardy was , for weeks , considered the European epicenter of the disease . 
Cremona Hospital in Lombardy – one of the hospitals that was hardest hit at the peak of the crisis – tells CNN it is already being told to plan for the worst . 
CNN visited Cremona Hospital in March 2020 .
