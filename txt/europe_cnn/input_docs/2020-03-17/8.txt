French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has warned the UK must up its coronavirus quarantine measures , in a further sign that some European leaders are uneasy with the UK â€™s approach to reducing the spread of virus . 
Speaking on French state TV channel France 2 , Philippe said : " There are confinements in Italy , in Spain . 
But for instance , if the UK continues not to apply any measures , we will find it difficult to accept British nationals on our territory . " 
His comments came after European Council President Charles Michel announced EU member states had agreed to reinforce EU external borders by applying a coordinated temporary restriction of non essential travel to the EU for a period of 30 days . 
The ban applies to people traveling into Europe from countries that are not part of European Union , the EFTA ( European Free Trade Association ) area , or the UK . 
The UK currently still has freedom of movement within the EU until the end of the Brexit transition period . 
However , under EU law , EU citizens or members of their family may be expelled from the host Member State on grounds of public policy , public security or public health . 
" It is not illegitimate to re establish health controls at borders . 
We must ensure that entry into the European area is controlled , " Philippe added .
