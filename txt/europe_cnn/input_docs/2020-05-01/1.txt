Lufthansa plans to reduce its fleet by around 100 aircraft , leaving the German airline with 10,000 excess staff , its chief executive told shareholders on Friday . 
Carsten Spohr said that preliminary figures for the first quarter showed a loss of 1.2 billion euros ( $ 1.3 billion ) and warned that the second quarter will be even worse . 700 of Lufthansa â€™s roughly 760 aircraft are grounded . 
The airline , one of the largest in Europe , has had to cancel 3,000 flights a day and is experiencing a 99 % decline in passengers , with 80,000 of its staff on reduced working hours . 
Lufthansa is in intensive bailout talks with the German government and is negotiating with the governments of Austria and Belgium for help for its subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines . 
Swiss International Air Lines is also part of the group . 
Lufthansa 's CEO said it was preparing to spend this summer on the ground and can hope for a proper restart in the autumn at the earliest . 
" It is going to be a very slow start up phase and we expect that global demand will only find its new balance in 2023 , " he added .
