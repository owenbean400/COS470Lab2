Criminals are taking advantage of the global coronavirus crisis and their activity is expected to rise as the pandemic drags on , Europol , the EU 's law enforcement agency , said in a new report Friday . 
The number of cyberattacks against organizations and individuals is " significant and is expected to increase , " Europol said . 
A cyberattack on Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic forced the hospital to shut down its entire IT network , postpone urgent surgical interventions and re route new acute patients to a nearby hospital . 
A large number of new or adapted fraud schemes , such as telephone schemes , supply scams and decontamination scams , can also be expected to emerge over the coming weeks as " fraudsters will attempt to capitalize further on the anxieties of people across Europe , " the agency said . 
The sale of counterfeit healthcare and sanitary products , as well as personal protective equipment and counterfeit pharmaceutical products , has also increased " manifold " since the start of the outbreak . 
Between March 3 and 10 alone , authorities have seized over 34,000 counterfeit surgical masks . 
Europol said organized property theft is also on the rise . 
Multiple EU member states have reported cases where perpetrators gain access to private homes by impersonating medical staff providing informational material or hygiene products , or conducting a " corona test . "
