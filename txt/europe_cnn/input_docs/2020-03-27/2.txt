One of the art world 's biggest events , Art Basel , has been postponed as the coronavirus pandemic continues to grip Europe . 
The Swiss art fair , which last year attracted almost 93,000 visitors from around the world , was due to take place in June . 
The four day event will now be held in September . 
The world 's biggest art fair : Now in its 51st year , Art Basel is a key date in the cultural calendar , offering over 250 galleries an opportunity to court collectors in an industry still heavily dependent on in person sales . 
Organizers have not yet announced details about refunds or compensation for exhibiting galleries and ticket holders . 
In a statement , Global Director of Art Basel Marc Spiegler said : ' We thank our galleries for the support and understanding of our highly complex decision to postpone the fair . 
We hope that the situation improves swiftly , and we will work closely with our exhibitors to deliver a successful fair in September . "
