The European Space Agency published new images showing sharp reductions in pollution over several major cities in Europe due to the coronavirus crisis . 
The data is based on observations by the Copernicus Sentinel 5P satellite , and show dramatic declines in the levels of nitrogen dioxide concentrations over Paris , Milan and Rome , compared to average concentrations a year ago . 
The measurements were taken over 10 days to even out changes in the weather , which affect the concentration of nitrogen dioxide . 
NO2 forms when fossil fuels such as coal , oil , gas or diesel are burned .
