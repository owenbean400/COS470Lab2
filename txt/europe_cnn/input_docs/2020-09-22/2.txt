School reopening policies will be crucial to fixing the economy , but schools should only open if Covid 19 case levels are low enough , experts told the US Joint Economic Committee Tuesday . 
Economist Austan Goolsbee told the committee that a lack of daycare and an inability to send kids back to schools is a significant barrier to fixing the economy , particularly for families that make a median income or less . 
" That ’s a tremendously critical issue because such a high share of those occupations must physically be at their location of work to do the job , " said Goolsbee , the Robert P . Gwinn professor of economics in the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago . 
Dr . Jeffrey Singer , a physician and senior fellow at the Cato Institute , pointed to countries like Taiwan that has kept schools open during the pandemic . 
Some countries in Europe , he added , have kept schools open for younger students without problems . 
In the US , he ’s not seeing the same commitment to reopening from teachers . 
" What we see happening is , in many instances , the teachers themselves are saying , I ’m not comfortable going back , " Singer said . 
Dr . Ashish Jha told the committee that while many European countries have been able to keep schools open , the levels of transmission of the virus in those communities is much lower than the rate of infection in the United States . 
Jha thinks a third of the country could go back safely given the level of spread in certain regions , if everyone wore a mask . 
For another third , where there is more disease , districts would have to be more careful and open up kindergarten through sixth grade . 
For another third of the country , the level of the virus is so high , schools should remain closed until the level of transmission declines . 
" I would close bars and I ’d close indoor dining before I close schools , " Jha said . 
" I think we can get most schools open if we let the data drive our decision . "
