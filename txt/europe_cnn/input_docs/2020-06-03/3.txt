The World Health Organization said that " cases in Europe continue to decline " during a briefing Wednesday . 
" Yesterday saw the fewest cases reported in Europe since the 22nd of March , " said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . 
Though Tedros added , WHO is " especially worried " about Central and South America where " many countries are witnessing accelerating epidemics . " 
" For several weeks , the number of cases reported each day in the Americas has been more than the rest of the world put together , " Tedros said . 
He added WHO is also seeing an increase of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean , Southeast Asia and Africa .
