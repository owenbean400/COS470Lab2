Austria will lift its coronavirus related border restrictions with seven neighboring countries from Thursday , the country 's Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said Wednesday . 
Those countries are Germany , Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Hungary , Slovenia , Slovakia and the Czech Republic . 
" We are returning to the pre corona situation regarding these countries , " Schallenberg declared , adding that there will therefore be no more border controls with these countries . 
However , Austria â€™s border with Italy -- one of Europe 's worst affected countries -- will remain closed . 
Schallenberg said the current infection rate in Italy would " not yet " allow an opening , adding that it would happen " as soon as the figures allow . " 
Schallenberg said that although most borders are reopening , it is still best to refrain from unnecessary travel and to holiday instead within Austria . 
Meanwhile , Germany is to lift its blanket travel warning for 29 European countries from June 15 , Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Wednesday . 
Berlin will then issue individual travel guidelines on a country by country basis , " unless there are no entry bans or large scale lockdowns in place in the respective countries , " he said . 
Germany does not advise travel to Britain due to its plan to impose a 14 day quarantine on new arrivals , Maas added . 
EU countries are starting to lift Covid 19 pandemic related travel restrictions in place since March . 
But Maas warned Germans to travel at their own risk . 
There will not be another repatriation initiative for any citizens stranded abroad this summer , he said .
