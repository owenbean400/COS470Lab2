Burberry is the latest luxury goods retailer to be hit by the coronavirus outbreak . 
The company said in a statement Friday that it has shuttered 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China because of a " material negative effect on luxury demand " caused by the outbreak . 
Stores that remain open are operating with limited hours and seeing fewer customers . 
" While we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last , we remain confident in our strategy . 
In the meantime , we are taking mitigating actions and every precaution to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees , " said Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti . 
Luxury goods retailers are expected to be particularly hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak , given that Chinese consumers account for about a third of global spend , according to Mc Kinsey . 
These companies usually benefit from increased spending over the Lunar New Year , but fewer people have been leaving their homes or traveling abroad since the virus hit . 
" The spending patterns of Chinese customers in Europe and other tourist destinations have been less impacted to date but given widening travel restrictions , we anticipate these to worsen over the coming weeks , " the company said . 
Shutdowns have also knocked car manufacturers and planemakers , which have been forced to keep plants closed for longer than expected , as well as the shipping industry , which is crucial to global trade . 
Wynn Resorts said Friday that it is losing as much as $ 2.6 million a day due to casino closures in Macao .
