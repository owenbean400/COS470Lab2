Hamacek is also Minister of Interior and the chairman of the Central Crisis Staff , a governmental body tasked with dealing with crises situations , including Covid 19 . 
The Czech government was on Wednesday meeting in an emergency session , discussing additional measures to curb the spread of coronavirus . 
Authorities in the Czech Republic reported 11,984 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday , the highest daily increase on record . 
At least 193,946 cases have been confirmed in the country since the pandemic began , according to data released by Czech health authorities early on Wednesday , and at least 1,619 people have died . 
The Czech Republic was hailed as a success story during Europe 's first wave of Covid 19 in March , mainly thanks to a strict mask mandate . 
But after relaxing the rules at the end of the summer after case numbers dropped , it has struggled to cope with the rising number of infections . 
According to the European Centre for Disease Control , the Czech Republic has the worst infection rate in Europe , with more than 900 infections per 100,000 people in the past 14 days .
