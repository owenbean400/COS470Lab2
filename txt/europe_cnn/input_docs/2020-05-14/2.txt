The French government has said it would be unacceptable for global pharmaceutical company Sanofi to reserve the first doses of a Covid 19 vaccine for the US market . 
Sanofi is a France based company . 
A month ago it signed a letter of intent with British multinational GSK to develop a vaccine for Covid 19 . 
At the time , the companies said they planned to initiate Phase I clinical trials in the second half of 2020 and , if successful , aimed to complete the development required for availability by the second half of 2021 . 
Deputy Finance Minister Agnès Pannier Runacher said she contacted Sanofi on Wednesday , after reading comments from the CEO suggesting that the US market would be prioritised once a Covid 19 vaccine was developed . 
Sanofi says its cooperation with the US ’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) will allow it to initiate production as soon as possible . 
The company said it was exploring similar opportunities within Europe .
