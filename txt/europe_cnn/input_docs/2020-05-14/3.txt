It will be " months not weeks " before there is a return to normal travel within the European Union , Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament on Thursday . 
He said Ireland was committed to preserving the EU â€™s policy of allowing citizens to travel , study and work elsewhere in the continent . 
" While these rights may be restricted for a time due to the pandemic and public health emergency , it is our policy to resume normal travel for business , leisure , study and visits to friends and relatives as soon as it is safe to do so , but not before , " he said . 
" This is something the European Commission is currently working on , " the prime minister said . 
Varadkar said anyone arriving at Irish ports or airports must self isolate for 14 days unless they meet the criteria for an exemption . 
His remarks come a day after the European Union unveiled an action plan to get its internal borders reopening , safely fire up its hospitality sector and to revive rail , road , air and sea connections that have been strangled during the pandemic .
