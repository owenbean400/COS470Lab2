The European Union drugs regulator is meeting Monday to discuss authorization of the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine . 
If the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) grants the vaccine a " conditional marketing authorization , " it will be the first coronavirus vaccine approved for use in the EU . 
But before member states can begin rolling out the vaccine , the European Commission must give its final approval , which is expected on December 23 . 
The EMA is planning to hold a virtual press briefing at 9am ET on the outcome of the meeting of its human medicines committee . 
Last week , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was " Europe ’s moment " and that vaccinations would start across the bloc on December 27 . 
The EU has purchased over 2 billion doses of potential vaccines to ensure equitable access across the bloc since the summer . 
That agreement includes the purchase of 300 million doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine , which is enough to vaccinate 150 million of the EU ’s 448 million citizens . 
On Saturday , Switzerland , which is not in the EU , authorized the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine . 
The United Kingdom and the United States granted emergency use authorization of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine earlier this month , with the first leg of their rollout now underway . 
The EU vaccine agreement also includes the purchase of up to 160 million doses -- enough for 80 million people -- from US biotech company Moderna , who could receive EMA authorization as early as January 6 .
