According to the Prime Minister ’s spokesperson , the UK Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office ( FCDO ) is working to support British nationals affected by the travel disruptions caused by the new restrictions . 
They will be providing food , drink and toilets for British truck drivers currently stuck in gridlock in the area surrounding the Eurotunnel — a key gateway to Europe for the transport of freight to and from the UK . 
During a briefing on Monday morning , Boris Johnson ’s spokesperson tried to allay fears over supply chains being impacted by travel restrictions . 
He said the majority of food supplies to the UK do not come via the English Channel and asserted that Britain ’s supply chains are " resilient , " with many retailers having already stocked up on goods ahead of the Christmas period . 
The Prime Minister is expected to give a press briefing Monday afternoon , after chairing an emergency COBRA meeting at Downing Street to address the fallout of the new international travel restrictions .
