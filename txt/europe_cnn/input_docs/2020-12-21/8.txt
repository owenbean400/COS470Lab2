New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he believes that a temporary travel ban on travelers from Europe should be instituted in light of a new Covid 19 variant having been discovered in southeast England , echoing sentiments expressed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo over the weekend . 
" Here you have a new strain , apparently even more infectiousâ€¦I think the best solution is at least a temporary travel ban from all incoming flights from Europe and the UK to protect us against an exacerbation of a second wave , " De Blasio said Monday , adding that at the very least , a requirement for a negative Covid 19 test before boarding a plane should be established . 
De Blasio said the authority to institute travel restrictions lies with the federal government .
