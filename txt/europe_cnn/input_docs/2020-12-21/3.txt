A new coronavirus variant discovered in the UK has prompted a new lockdown and travel bans . 
But a World Health official says viruses mutate and change all the time , and there are processes in place " to really evaluate what these mutations are and what they mean . " 
Maria Van Kerkhove , the World Health Organization ’s technical lead for Covid 19 , told CNN ’s Erica Hill Monday : " We do not anticipate any impact on the vaccine and on vaccination , " she added . 
" And I think that ’s really important as well , but the studies need to be done . 
We need to make sure we follow the science , and we will report , the UK and WHO will report information as soon as we learn it . " 
Van Kerkhove explained that the variant under investigation was detected through routine surveillance activities . 
There was increasing transmission in the southeast of England as it moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3 restrictions . 
It was retrospectively identified that some had the lineage back in September . 
WHO was alerted of the variant on Dec . 14 and over the last week it has been working with scientists in the UK through their regional office in Europe and the European Centers for Disease Control to understand , Van Kerkhove said .
