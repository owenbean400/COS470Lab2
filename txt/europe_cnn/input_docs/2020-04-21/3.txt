After six weeks in lockdown , children under 14 in Spain will be allowed to accompany one adult on trips to places like supermarkets , pharmacies and banks starting Monday , according to a new decree announced by the Spanish government today . 
" The government is aware that this is only a partial relief from this confinement , but we would like to stress that our priority is to avoid a hypothetical regression in the fight against the virus , " said Spanish government spokesperson and finance minister María Jesús Montero . 
Montero defended the decision , saying " common sense and rationality cannot be substituted , " and activities such as bike riding — where a child 's movements cannot be controlled — would not be advisable . 
Some context : Spain has the strictest coronavirus confinement measures in Europe . 
But health professionals have cautioned that extended confinement could prove harmful to children ’s physical and mental health . 
Montero and other officials have said these measures would not allow kids to just go out and play . 
Parks , playgrounds and beaches remain closed to the public .
