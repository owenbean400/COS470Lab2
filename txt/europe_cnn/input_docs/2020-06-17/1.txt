The first patient in a phase 3 trial was dosed with a drug from Eli Lilly that the pharmaceutical company hopes can help hospitalized patients with Covid 19 . 
The drug — named baricitinib and marketed as Olumiant — is a therapy approved to treat adults that have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis . 
The phase 3 study will enroll 400 patients with Covid 19 who have at least one marker for inflammation but have not been put on a ventilator by the start of the study . 
The study looks at whether the drug could reduce cytokine storm , the body ’s hyper inflammatory response to the virus and a severe complication that can come with Covid 19 infection . 
About the trial : The trial will be conducted in the United States , Latin America and Europe . 
Lilly said the company should know how well the therapy works in a couple of months . 
This is a randomized , double blind , placebo controlled trial . 
Patients will get standard care or they will be treated with baricitinib for 14 days or until they are discharged from the hospital . 
The study will measure if someone improves , if they are put on a ventilator by day 28 , or if they die . 
The drug is also being used in a few other trials with Covid 19 patients . 
In one trial by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , scientists are trialing the drug in combination with Gilead ’s antiviral remdesivir .
