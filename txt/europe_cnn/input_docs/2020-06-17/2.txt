The company that makes the antiviral drug remdesivir , used to treat coronavirus , says it is about to start advanced trials of the drug in children . 
Gilead Sciences said it was starting a phase 2/3 trial in 50 pediatric patients with moderate to severe Covid 19 who are in the hospital . 
These trials are meant to assess safety and efficacy . 
Children from babies on up will be eligible for the trial , being run at 30 sites in the US and Europe . 
Remdesivir , which is infused , is the only drug that has US Food and Drug Administration emergency authorization for use in treating coronavirus infections . 
Gilead has treated pediatric patients with remdesivir since February under compassionate use program . 
A recent study funded by Gilead found that moderately ill Covid 19 patients who received a five day course of remdesivir were more likely to have clinical improvement after 11 days compared to those who received traditional standard of care alone , according to the company .
