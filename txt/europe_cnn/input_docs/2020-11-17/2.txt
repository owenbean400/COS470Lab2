France has become the first country in Europe to top two million confirmed cases of coronavirus , according to data from Johns Hopkins University and the French national health agency . 
In a statement on Tuesday evening , the country ’s health agency director Jerome Salomon confirmed that the cumulative number of coronavirus cases in France now stands at at least 2,036,755 . 
" This second wave , which we are all facing , is massive , deadly and is straining all of our caregivers and our health system as a whole , " he added . 
While France has now registered the highest cumulative number of coronavirus cases in Europe overall , Salomon noted that the current coronavirus reproduction rate in France is now below one , while the daily number of new cases has declined in the last week . 
" In recent days , the number of new cases has declined , redoubling efforts to regain control of the epidemic , " Salomon said , adding that public adherence to national coronavirus restrictions is now " beginning to bear fruit " in France . 
" All collective efforts , respect for curfews and national confinement measures serve to explain this positive trend . 
It is by maintaining a very high level of vigilance and mobilization that we will be able to spend the end of year celebrations and the winter months in the safest conditions , " he added . 
According to the latest data from the national health agency , a total of 33,139 coronavirus patients are currently in hospital – down by 327 since Monday – with 4,838 of those in intensive care .
