UNMC is currently running a clinical trial of an experimental coronavirus treatment , and have a second participant enrolled in the trial . 
The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . 
" We 're very pleased with the fact that we brought this trial on extremely quickly along with our colleagues at the NIH , " said Rupp . 
He urged the public not to panic : " I do agree we need to take a collective deep breath and realize this is not some existential threat against mankind . 
A quarter to a third of us are not going to die in the next year , like in Europe in the Middle Ages , " Rupp said . 
But we should still be cautious : " This is a very serious event and one that we need to take seriously and prepare for and do everything we can to blunt the spread of this pandemic , " he added , warning that a worst case scenario could lead to " Millions of potential infections , resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths .
