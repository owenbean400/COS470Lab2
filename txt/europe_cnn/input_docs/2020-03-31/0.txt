Another macabre milestone in the United States : More than 3,000 people have now died as a result of Covid 19 in the US , and the rate of those killed each day is not expected to slow down soon . 
A model cited by the White House estimated that 82,000 people could die from coronavirus by August , even with social distancing measures in place . 
The model , which is updated regularly , predicted Monday morning Eastern Time that more than 2,000 people could die each day in mid April , when the virus is predicted to hit the country hardest . 
At least 574 coronavirus related deaths were reported in the US on Monday , according to a count by CNN Health . 
More than 160,000 have been infected in the country . 
A critical 30 days ahead : President Donald Trump said he believes the next 30 days are important for flattening the curve to stop the outbreak of coronavirus . 
He emphasized the importance of social distancing , saying that every American " has a role to play in winning this war . " 
Nearly 80 % of the US population are under stay at home orders . 
Trump told reporters at a news conference yesterday that the administration has " talked about " a nationwide stay at home order , similar to those of some states , but said it would be very " tough " to enforce and " not something we wanted to do . " 
Worrying signs in India : The world 's second most populous country reported 227 new coronavirus patients Monday , its highest single day jump since the outbreak began . 
While the numbers in India are relatively low -- at least 1,251 patients , 32 of whom died -- fatalities have been reported nationwide by the Indian Ministry of Health and concerns are growing . 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for all inside the country to self isolate , but that is effectively impossible for the millions of people who are either homeless or live in dilapidated slums .
