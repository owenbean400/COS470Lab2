Britain 's largest trade unions have called on the government to reconsider its plan to partially open English schools on June 1 , over health and safety concerns for teachers . 
The UK government currently hopes to partially reopen schools in England next month but its clash with unions over the issue has become a tense political issue in the country . 
The joint statement released on Wednesday was signed by major trade unions , including the National Education Union which describes itself as the largest education union in Europe , with more than 450,000 members . 
The groups are calling for a set of principles over safety to be met including : additional resources for PPE , local autonomy to close schools with clusters of cases , a taskforce to produce statutory guidance and no increase in pupil numbers until a national test and trace scheme is implemented . 
Education Secretary Gavin Williamson accused the unions of " scaremongering " in parliament on Wednesday , but struck a conciliatory tone in a op ed published in the Daily Mail newspaper on Friday . 
Williamson said he had organized for union leaders to meet with the UK â€™s Chief Medical Officer and other experts to be briefed on the scientific advice . 
Details on the reopening of schools in other parts of the UK will be decided by their devolved governments .
