Authorities ordered a new lockdown Saturday for some 200,000 people in Lleida province , in Spain 's northeastern Catalonia region , due to Covid 19 outbreaks there -- the first confinement order since the nation ’s state of emergency was lifted on June 21 . 
" We ’ve decided to implement perimeter controls around Segrià ( county ) in response to data that confirm significant growth in the number of Covid 19 cases , " Catalan regional president Quim Torra announced at a press conference . 
The confinement started at midday Saturday and includes the provincial capital of Lleida . 
It will be enforced by 24 police checkpoints around the county ’s perimeter , preventing movement in and out , except for work or to care for people with special needs , two Catalan government spokesmen told CNN . 
For the past few weeks , medical personnel have been trying to control various coronavirus outbreaks in the county , involving seasonal farm workers at agricultural enterprises , and also at a senior care facility and a small hotel that cares for the homeless . 
Spain has tallied more than 28,000 deaths and 250,000 cases from the pandemic , making it one of the hardest hit countries in Europe . 
But nationwide confinement for three and a half months slowed the pace of the virus ' spread . 
The Spanish government handed back control to Spain ’s 17 regional governments when it lifted the state of emergency on June 21 . 
Since then , officials have reported some 50 outbreaks of new cases nationwide , localized around businesses , care facilities , and even parties . 
But none has reached the level of the Segrià county situation . 
Residents will be able to move around within the county for essential business , but social gatherings in public will be limited to 10 people , the Catalan government said .
