White House coronavirus task force member , Dr . Anthony Fauci , has warned that individual states across the US may have relaxed lockdown regulations too soon , adding that the country has so far been unsuccessful in gaining control over the national outbreak . 
" In the United States , even in the most strict lockdowns , only about 50 % of the country locked down -- that allowed for the perpetuation of the outbreak , which we never did get under very good control , " Fauci told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday . 
" The problem we ’re facing now is the attempt to re open or open the government and get it back to some form of normality . 
We ’re seeing very disturbing spikes in different individual states in the United States , " he added . 
Speaking to the Today program , Fauci highlighted that the easing of lockdown restrictions has allowed members of the public to congregate in groups beyond the recommended number , without the use of face masks -- a factor , he says , which has contributed to the " kind of outbreaks " the US is now seeing . 
US at risk of " greater outbreak " : Pressed on how the US has fared in comparison to the UK and Europe in handling the pandemic , the nation ’s top infectious disease expert conceded that the situation has been " more problematic " in the US . 
" It ’s a serious situation … we got hit very badly , worse than any country with regard to the number of cases and the number of deaths , " Fauci said . 
" What we ’ve seen over the last several days is a spike in cases that is way beyond the worst spikes that we ’ve seen . 
That is not good news ... we ’ve got to get that under control , or we risk an even greater outbreak in the United States , " he added .
