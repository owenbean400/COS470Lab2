Italy is further easing its coronavirus lockdown measures to allow professional sporting events , such as the Coppa Italia football match , to resume behind closed doors starting Friday , Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a news conference Thursday night . 
Other establishments can also reopen starting June 25 , including summer camps , kindergartens , betting rooms , and bingo halls , Conte said , announcing that he had just signed a decree that eases further the lockdown measures . 
Non professional sports that involve physical contact may also resume . 
Local officials will be able to assess the viability of restarting these activities given the number of coronavirus cases in each region . 
Fairs , convention centers , and nightclubs with dancing will not be permitted to restart their activities until July 14 . 
Italy has been on a nationwide lockdown since March 9 . 
Conte also announced the expansion of Italy 's contact tracing program . 
Starting Monday , a contact tracing app that has been tested in four regions will be implemented nationwide . 
" Citizens can download the app in great security ... it protects privacy , " Conte said . 
" We are proud of this app that grants a further service to citizens and we were the first in Europe to have reached this result that is very sophisticated from a technical point of view . "
