The European Commission has drawn up a set of criteria and guidelines that will gradually allow for the reopening of Europe ’s external borders from July 1 . 
Using a checklist created by the Commission , European countries will be asked to draw up a list of non European Union countries for which travel restrictions can be lifted , to be reviewed on a regular basis . 
The decision to lift restrictions for a specific country will be based on whether that country is in a similar or better epidemiological situation than Europe , whether it has comparable hygiene measures at its transport hubs and whether or not that country has lifted travel restrictions for the EU . 
Announcing the guidelines , Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said she hoped the list " can become longer and longer and have more and more countries on it . 
But that has to be taken gradually . " 
If it ’s decided that restrictions are to remain in place for a country , the commission proposes gradually increasing the categories of permitted travellers to include , for instance , international students or highly skilled non EU workers . 
" While we will all have to remain careful , the time has come to make concrete preparations for lifting restrictions , " said Johansson . 
" International travel is key for tourism and business , and for family and friends reconnecting . " 
The decision to open external borders will be closely monitored and travel restrictions may be reintroduced for a specific country at any time if the health situation in that country changes , the commission said . 
The decision to open and close borders remains the prerogative of an individual European country . 
But the commission stressed the need for the lifting of restrictions to be done in a coordinated way across Europe . 
European external borders have been closed since March following the outbreak of the coronavirus .
