The Swedish town of Lund has " dumped " 1,000 kilograms of chicken manure — or about 2,200 pounds — in the city ’s main park to deter gatherings and prevent the town from becoming an " epicenter of coronavirus , " Lund ’s Mayor Philip Sandberg told CNN on Thursday . 
The city ’s Environment Committee said on Tuesday that the Lund City Park will be closed for " maintenance measures " on Walpurgis Day , a holiday starting on Thursday in northern Europe . 
Sandberg told CNN they would finish the manure " dumping " on Thursday and while the park and its surrounding area will smell for several days , it was necessary for fertilization as the manure will not only deter visitors , but also get the lawn ready for the summer . 
While Sweden has banned gatherings of more than 50 people , Sandberg said in Lund they are trying to get people to social distance as much as possible as it is proven " parks can carry a severe risk to coronavirus . " 
" We do not want to become an epicenter for coronavirus so we are doing what we can to fertilize the lawn and keep people safe , " Sandberg added . 
" It has been proven that parks can carry a severe risk to coronavirus with the amount of people gathering in them , so this is an important measure for us to take , whilst getting the lawn ready for better weather . " 
He added that the public ’s reaction to this has been positive because they too understand it will be " worth it . "
