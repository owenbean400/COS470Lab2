The French economy has shrunk by 5.8 % in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter -- the biggest drop since the country began recording its quarterly GDP in 1949 , said France 's national statistics agency , INSEE , on Thursday . 
Europe 's third largest economy â€™s slump is caused mainly by the coronavirus lockdown measures that have been in place since mid March , according to an estimate released by INSEE . 
A way out of lockdown : French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe outlined plans yesterday to gradually ease the country 's coronavirus restrictions . 
France will be divided into red or green zones , depending on their case numbers , testing efficiency and health care capacity . 
The red zones will face stricter measures , while restrictions will be loosened more in the green zones .
