Europe remains " very much in the grip of this pandemic , " the World Health Organization warned on Thursday . 
" Today the European region accounts for 46 % of cases , and 63 % of deaths globally , " regional director Dr Hans Kluger said . 
Although Europe is seeing evidence of a " plateau or a reduction " of new cases since the introduction of social distancing measures , the WHO warned against complacency . 
" This virus is unforgiving . 
We must remain vigilant , persevere and be patient , ready to ramp up measures as and when needed , " Dr Kluger said . 
Cumulative cases of Covid 19 have increased by 15 % over the past seven days , while deaths have risen by 17 % during the same period . 
Dr Kluger said : " The situation across our region is not uniform . 
Every country is mapping out its route to a new normal . 
Thursday marks three months since WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the spread of coronavirus a public health emergency .
