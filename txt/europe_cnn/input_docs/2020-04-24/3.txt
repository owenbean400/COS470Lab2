EU leaders have agreed to create a fund that could raise at least 1 trillion euros ( $ 1.1 trillion ) to rebuild regional economies ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic . 
" This fund shall be of a sufficient magnitude , targeted towards the sectors and geographical parts of Europe most affected , and be dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis , " leaders of the 27 EU countries said in a statement after they met via video conference on Thursday . 
The heads of the EU governments asked officials at the European Commission to come up with detailed proposals " urgently " that will include how the recovery fund will relate to the bloc 's budget for 2021-2027 , they added . 
The EU is planning to expand its budget from about 1.2 % of GDP to 2 % of GDP and then use those additional funds as a guarantee to borrow at low rates from financial markets . 
Asked by reporters how much could be raised , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said : " This has to be looked at thoroughly ... but we are not talking about billion [ s ] , we are talking about trillion [ s ] . " 
The EU leaders also signed off on an immediate package of rescue measures worth at least € 500 billion ( $ 538 billion ) drawn up earlier this month by finance ministers . 
That package includes up to € 100 billion ( $ 110 billion ) in wage subsidies aimed at preventing mass layoffs , as well as hundreds of billions in loans to businesses and credit for EU governments . 
" There are reasons for some optimism that , even if we do not get as joined up a response as we 'd like overall , the European fiscal response to this crisis may yet end up being sizeable , " commented Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes in a research note on Friday .
