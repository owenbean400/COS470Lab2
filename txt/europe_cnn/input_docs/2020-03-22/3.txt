Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has been in meetings with health and security officials on Sunday morning , as Spaniards prepare for a possible extension of their country 's state of emergency . 
Sanchez is expected to address the nation in a televised speech later on Sunday . 
It comes with the country 's death toll from the virus accelerating . 
The country 's health ministry said on Sunday that another 394 had died in just the past 24 hours , bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities to 1,720 . 
" There are hard days ahead , " Sanchez said in a televised briefing on Saturday . 
" We have to get ready from a physiological and emotional standpoint . 
We have to get to the end of next week strong , very strong . 
The risk is everywhere . " 
Spain has been locked down and placed in a state of emergency since Friday March 13 . 
The period was initially expected to last 15 days , but cases in the country continue to soar as that deadline approaches . 
Emergency hospitals have been set up across the country , while residents have been urged to stay indoors and normally busy streets are deserted . 
Almost 25,000 cases have been reported in total , with a drastic spike of 5,000 new cases reported on Saturday . 
" Spain is among the most affected countries in Europe and in the world , " Sanchez said on Saturday , adding that the worst is still to come . 
In an effort to strengthen Spain 's response to the health crisis , Sanchez announced the national production of masks , ventilators and tests . 
Meanwhile , the government has bought 640,000 reliable ratified fast tests , which will soon be 1 million , and within the next few hours 1.3 million masks will be handed to health personnel and patients , Sanchez said .
