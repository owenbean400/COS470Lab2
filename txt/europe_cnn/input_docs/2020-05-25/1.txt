Vienna â€™s medical university successfully conducted the first coronavirus lung transplant in Europe last week , the medical center said in a press release Monday . 
The hospital said the 45 year old COVID 19 patient would not have survived otherwise but is now recovering well . 
The hospital said the patient was in good health without prior illnesses before coming down with coronavirus eight weeks ago . Shortly after falling ill , her condition deteriorated dramatically . 
" The situation was hopeless , " Klepetko said . 
" The lung was like a block , there was nothing left , " The hospital describes the operation as being " highly complicated " but successful . 
Klepetko added , " All organs are working and we are very satisfied . 
But it will still be a long way ahead until we can hopefully discharge her from the hospital . "
