Production has begun on a rapid saliva based coronavirus test that delivers readings in under an hour , it was announced today . 
The French consortium , formed by biotechnology company SKILLCELL , laboratory CNRS SYS2DIAG and digital company VOGO , said in a press release that the test would be available from mid June for European markets . 
The test -- named " Easy Cov " -- is performed by healthcare professionals and involves collecting less than 1 millilitre of saliva from under a patient â€™s tongue . 
Earlier this month , the US Food and Drug Administration authorized a Covid 19 saliva test in which a patient can collect a saliva sample at home but would need to mail it to a lab and wait for the results to be processed .
