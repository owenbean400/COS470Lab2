A " very substantial " part of the Spanish population could be vaccinated in the first half of 2021 , according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez . 
His comments follow German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's announcement that she expects a coronavirus vaccine to be approved in Europe in December , or " very soon after the turn of the year . " 
The Prime Minister added that a large majority of the vaccines would be acquired through the European Union . 
The bloc has been moving towards coordinating the purchase and delivery of vaccines , to be shared equally among its member states , based on population numbers . 
" The EU has already signed three contracts with pharmaceuticals . 
Our country would be entitled to 10 % of contracted doses . 
We have a hopeful horizon , " he said , adding that " any euphoria must be compensated by caution . "
