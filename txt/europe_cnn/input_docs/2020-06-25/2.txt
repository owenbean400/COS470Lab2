Timing is key when it comes to getting accurate results from Covid 19 antibody tests that are used to determine if someone has been infected with the novel coronavirus , according to a new Cochrane Review paper . 
Antibody tests are better at detecting Covid 19 in people two or more weeks after their symptoms started , but there is not yet enough evidence to determine how well they work more than five weeks after , or among people who had milder disease or no symptoms at all , suggests the review , published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on Thursday . 
" This is largely driven by when the samples are taken from the patients , " Deeks said . 
" This is not a new science , but it â€™s something which has not been well thought through in a lot of the studies we were reviewing . " 
A Cochrane Review is a systemic analysis of published studies on a given topic , and often physicians , nurses , patients , researchers or funders turn to Cochrane evidence to help with decision making or better understanding a medical issue . 
The new review on the accuracy of antibody tests , spanning more than 300 pages , was authored by Cochrane researchers from institutions across Europe and led by experts from the University of Birmingham .
