Lockdown measures introduced by authorities across Europe to limit the spread of coronavirus have disproportionately impacted ethnic minority communities , a new study by Amnesty International has found . 
According to a report released by the human rights organization Wednesday , minority communities across the continent have been " targeted with violence , discriminatory identity checks , forced quarantines and fines " by local authorities , in relation to new coronavirus related legislation . 
" This report highlights systemic human rights concerns regarding institutional racism , discrimination in law enforcement and lack of accountability regarding allegations of unlawful use of force by law enforcement officials , " Amnesty said . 
The study , which covers 12 countries across Europe , documents several cases in which law enforcement officials reportedly " resorted to the unlawful use of force " to implement lockdown legislation , often occurring in the context of police identity checks . 
According to Amnesty â€™s findings , members of the Roma community living in informal settlements , and refugees , asylum seekers and migrants living in camps , have experienced a " disproportionate and discriminatory " implementation of lockdown measures .
