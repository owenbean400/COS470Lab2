Ireland has now moved to " Level 5 " measures — in what is now Europe ’s strictest coronavirus lockdown . 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced the restrictions on Monday when the country ’s case count topped 50,000 . 
The restrictions are set to be in place for six weeks to deal with the " deteriorating situation with the disease across the country . " 
Under the new measures , people are asked to work from home , unless providing an essential service . 
Social gatherings at homes and gardens are prohibited , but people will be allowed to exercise in parks close their homes . 
Schools , childcare services and " essential retail " services will remain open under the restrictions . 
Bars and restaurants are allowed to be open only for take away and delivery service during the period . 
Ireland recorded an increase of nearly 2,000 new cases last week over the week before , prompting the government to impose the stringent measures .
