Some voters who cast their ballot for Donald Trump in 2016 say the coronavirus pandemic has influenced their decision to vote for Joe Biden in November . 
Lori Mc Cammon said Trump " has not taken one ounce of responsibility " for the Covid 19 pandemic . 
" From day one , we should ’ve a national mandate on wearing masks . 
We could ’ve had this thing under control in six weeks if he had just done his job , " Mc Cammon said on CNN ’s " New Day . " 
But L.A . Key , a Trump voter , thinks the President has done an " amazing job " responding to the virus and said that she does not believe that 180,000 Americans have died of Covid 19 . 
Voter Michele Morrow , a nurse , said the pandemic is Trump ’s " greatest achievement , " citing his implementation of travel restrictions in February . 
Trump has said that he " closed the border " from China and Europe . 
But according to a CNN fact check , that is misleading : Both policies contained multiple exemptions , including for US citizens and permanent residents ; the Europe policy exempted entire countries . 
Only foreign nationals who had been in China , Europe 's Schengen area , the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the US .
