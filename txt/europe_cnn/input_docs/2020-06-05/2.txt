The fight against the coronavirus will not be over " until there is no virus anywhere in the world , " according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) spokesperson Dr . Margaret Harris . 
Speaking at a press briefing in Geneva , Harris confirmed that there have been " upticks " of the virus in countries which have eased measures , but she said that she was " not talking specifically about Europe " . 
The World Health Organization has continually affirmed that countries easing measures should do so gradually and cautiously .
