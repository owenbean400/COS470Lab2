Austria reported a new daily record of 8,241 new coronavirus infections on Saturday , according to data on the country 's interior ministry website . 
In total , 147,220 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Austria since the start of the pandemic , and 1,377 people have died . 
Austria entered its second national lockdown this week , with new measures including a curfew between 8 p.m . and 6 a.m . and the closure of leisure and culture facilities . 
Lockdowns are multiplying throughout Europe as Covid 19 cases rise exponentially , threatening to push health services across the continent to breaking point . 
Fearing all of its intensive care beds could be full by mid November , France implemented nationwide restrictions at the end of October -- as did Belgium and Ireland . 
Germany 's softer , so called " lockdown light " restrictions began on Monday , and Austria followed suit on Tuesday .
