Australian and New Zealand passengers will be evacuated from a stricken Antarctic cruise ship Thursday , after almost 60 % of those onboard tested positive for the coronavirus . 
The Greg Mortimer , a cruise liner operated by Australia 's Aurora Expeditions , departed March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia . 
Since the beginning of April , however , the ship has been stuck off the coast of Uruguay , after authorities refused to allow passengers to disembark due to the risk of coronavirus . 
Of the 217 people on board , 128 passengers and crew have now tested positive for the virus . 
Six passengers requiring specialized care have been transferred to medical facilities in Montevideo -- a video posted online by the Uruguayan navy showed them being transferred from ship to ship wearing full protective gear . 
Passengers from Europe and America who have tested positive for coronavirus , however , will have to remain onboard until they have a negative test result , after which they may be able to depart via Brazil , Aurora said . 
All passengers will be retested every two or three days , according to the company 's website .
