European aircraft maker Airbus announced Wednesday it would cut production by about a third , as the troubled airline industry is being forced to defer deliveries due to the plunge in air traffic . 
Airbus said the reduced schedule was designed " to adapt to the new coronavirus market environment . " 
The company delivered only 122 of the 182 planes it built during the quarter because of " customer requests to defer deliveries , " it said . 
It will now build about 40 of the A320 each month , down from 60 per month of its best selling single aisle jet . 
The A330 will produce two a month from nine , and the A350 production has been scaled back to six a month from between nine and 10 . 
Airbus has temporarily halted production at numerous plants in Europe and North America due to health concerns . 
The reduced production schedule will be in place when the plants resume work . 
Rival Boeing , which reports its deliveries and orders next week , also has temporarily stopped building commercial jets as well . 
More than half the 22,000 planes in the global commercial airline fleet have been grounded in the crisis , according to tracking firm Cirium , and that number is climbing as airlines slash their schedules , or cancel all flights in some cases , due to a combination of travel restrictions and passengers ' health concerns .
