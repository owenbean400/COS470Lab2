Denmark 's government has backtracked on an order to kill all mink in the country after conceding it had no legal authority to order a mass cull . 
Denmark ordered the cull , which included killing healthy mink , after finding that a coronavirus mutation had spread widely across more than 200 Danish mink farms . 
The mutated virus has also spread to 12 humans . 
Though healthy minks may have been saved from the cull for now , a prior government order requiring the killing of all infected mink herds , as well as herds within a radius of 7.8 kilometers ( 4.8 miles ) , appears to still be in place . 
Prior to the culls , Denmark was home to more than 15 million mink , which are raised for their pelts . 
The country 's human population stands at around 5.5 million . 
The cull of uninfected mink was thrown into doubt when questions were raised about the order 's legal basis , according to state broadcaster TV2 . 
After facing questions from the opposition , the government admitted that it did not have the legal authority to order the cull of healthy mink on farms unaffected by the outbreak . 
Covid 19 mutations are normal , and it is not yet clear if this mutation was significant . 
" There are huge doubts relating to whether the planned cull was based on an adequate scientific basis , " Jakob Ellemann Jensen , the leader of the Liberals opposition , told broadcaster TV2 . 
" At the same time , one 's depriving a lot of people of their livelihoods . " 
Europe â€™s CDC has said that the mutation " may have implications for immunity , reinfections and the effectiveness of Covid 19 vaccines , " but that " there is currently a high level of uncertainty over this . "
