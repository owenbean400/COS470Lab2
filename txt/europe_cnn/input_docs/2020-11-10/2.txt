The European Union will authorize a contract on Wednesday for up to 300 million doses of a candidate vaccine developed by Pfizer and Bio NTech , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced . 
" Once this vaccine becomes available , our plan is to deploy it quickly , everywhere in Europe , " von der Leyen said in a statement on Tuesday . 
" This will be the fourth contract with a pharmaceutical company to buy vaccines . 
And more will come . 
Because we need to have a broad portfolio of vaccines based on different technologies . " 
The EU ’s announcement comes after drug giant Pfizer announced Monday that an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine shows it is more than 90 % effective – a much better than expected efficacy . 
" This is the most promising vaccine so far . 
A safe and effective vaccine is our best chance to beat coronavirus and return to our normal lives , " von der Leyen said , highlighting that the EU had already begun working with member states to prepare national vaccine campaigns . 
The European Commission has also signed contracts for vaccines with drug giants Sanofi GSK , Astra Zeneca and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV .
