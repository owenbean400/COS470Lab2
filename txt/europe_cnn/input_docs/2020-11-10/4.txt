Hospitals at risk : Intensive care unit ( ICU ) capacity is one of the parameters the Italian Health Ministry considers when declaring regions " red zones " or " orange zones " -- meaning they face tighter restrictions . 
Hospitals should not exceed 30 % of their ICU capacity . 
President of the National Health Council Franco Locatelli said during a weekly Covid 19 update that two regions -- Lombardy and Umbria -- have surpassed the 30 % threshold of ICU capacity and the regions of Tuscany and Valle d ’Aosta are at 29 % capacity . 
Virologist Giorgio Palù of Padua University said in a TV interview on Tuesday that , as Europe 's second wave continues and ICUs are pushed to their limits , anesthetists are required to make difficult choices . 
The head of Italy 's National Institute of Health Silvio Brusaferro , said on Tuesday that the transmission rate was " stable . " 
Brusaferro said the epidemic curve was still growing but at a slower rate , as a result of the government 's successful restrictive measures .
