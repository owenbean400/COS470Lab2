Much of Europe is still on lockdown with severe movement restrictions -- but not Sweden . 
Restaurants and bars are open in the Nordic country , playgrounds and schools too , and the government is relying on voluntary action to stem the spread of Covid 19 . 
It 's a controversial approach , and one that 's drawn President Donald Trump 's attention . 
" Sweden did that , the herd , they call it the herd . 
Sweden 's suffering very , very badly , " Trump said on Tuesday . 
The next day , Sweden 's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said Trump was " factually wrong " to suggest that Sweden was following the " herd immunity " theory . 
Here 's their strategy : The idea , Linde said , was " No lockdown and we rely very much on people taking responsibility themselves . " 
The approach is about encouraging and recommending , not compulsion . 
Two days after Spain imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 14 , Swedish authorities were encouraging people to wash hands and stay at home if sick . 
On March 24 , new rules were introduced to avoid crowding at restaurants . 
But they very much stayed open . 
Is it working ? 
" I think Sweden is doing okay , " Swedish state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told CNN affiliate Expressen . 
" It 's producing quality results the same way it 's always done . 
So far Swedish health care is handling this pandemic in a fantastic way . " 
Sweden has reported 9,141 cases of the coronavirus and 793 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
