Denmark has reported a rise in Covid 19 cases , after being one of the first European countries to reopen . 
New cases have been recorded in 67 out of Denmark 's 98 municipalities , a press advisor for the Danish Ministry of Health told CNN . 
Seventy six new cases were recorded Monday , according to the ministry . 
Denmark 's second biggest city , Aarhus , recorded the highest number of new infections . 
The spike means the country 's virus reproduction rate , or " R , " has risen to 1.4 -- meaning each person with the virus infects an average of 1.4 other people . 
Denmark has recorded 14,815 confirmed cases and 620 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic . 
The country first closed its borders to non citizens on March 13 , it also restricted public gatherings and closed schools . 
Denmark was one of the first European countries to reopen schools with the first students returning in mid April . 
Due to the rise in case numbers , the Danish government last week decided to postpone a decision on lifting restrictions on the number of people allowed at some public gatherings . 
The press advisor told CNN that Denmark 's political parties are to meet on Wednesday to discuss the delay and the plans for Phase Four of the country 's lockdown exit , under which nightclubs and concert venues are set to reopen .
