Airlines are calling on governments across the globe to take further measures over the " unprecedented challenges " faced by the industry during the coronavirus outbreak . 
The statement urged governments " to prepare for the broad economic effects from actions taken by states to contain the spread of Covid 19 , and to evaluate all possible means to assist the airline industry . " 
The alliances called on airport operators to evaluate landing charges and fees " to mitigate the financial pressure faced by airlines due to a severe decline in passenger demand . " 
They welcomed recent moves by some regulators to temporarily suspend slot regulations and urged others to follow suit . 
The International Air Transport Association estimates up to $ 113 billion in revenue losses for global passenger airlines . 
The alliances warned that the forecasted revenue loss does not include travel restrictions recently imposed by the US and other countries . 
European low cost carrier Ryanair said that it could not rule out the full grounding of its aircraft fleet as a result of the coronavirus . 
The airline said in a press release Monday that travel restrictions " many of which have been imposed without notice " have had a significant negative impact , and it expected the result would be the grounding of the majority of its aircraft across Europe over the next seven to 10 days . 
" We are working with our people and our unions across all EU countries to address this extraordinary and unprecedented Covid 19 event , " the company said . 
Ryanair said it was taking immediate action to reduce expenses by freezing recruitment and discretionary spending , implementing voluntary leave options , temporarily suspending employment contracts , and making significant reductions to working hours and payments .
