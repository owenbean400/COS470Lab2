As Covid 19 cases soar across the US , the country is on a path to " look a lot like Europe , " warned Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration . 
European countries have been reporting record numbers of Covid 19 cases as the continent prepares for the pandemic to intensify through winter . 
" We 're on a trajectory to look a lot like Europe as we enter the month of November . 
So I think things are going to get worse , " Gottlieb said . 
" What we have is very diffuse spread . 
We 're sort of at the beginning of this steep part of that epidemic curve right now . "
