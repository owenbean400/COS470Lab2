Queen Elizabeth II has likened the British public 's response to the coronavirus pandemic with the efforts of its soldiers during World War II , in a televised speech delivered exactly 75 years after her father marked the end of fighting in Europe . 
Speaking on the 75th anniversary of VE Day , the Queen remembered her own experiences at the end of fighting on the continent and praised the " strength and courage " of British and Allied troops who brought about Germany 's surrender on May 8 , 1945 . 
" Never give up , never despair — that was the message of VE Day , " the monarch said . 
" I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace . " 
Acknowledging the impact on modern British life of the coronavirus pandemic , which has forced this year 's public commemorations to be canceled , she also drew parallels between the UK 's wartime generation and their modern compatriots . 
" Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish . 
Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps , " she said at the conclusion of her speech . 
" But our streets are not empty ; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other . 
" When I look at our country today , and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another , I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers , sailors and airmen would recognize and admire , " the Queen added . 
The speech marked the second time the 94 year old monarch has addressed the country since the coronavirus outbreak began — usually a rare occurrence saved only for her annual Christmas Day message .
