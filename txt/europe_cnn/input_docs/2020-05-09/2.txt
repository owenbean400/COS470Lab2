Roy Horn , half of the popular Las Vegas animal and magic act Siegfried and Roy , died Friday of complications from the coronavirus , according to his publicist . 
He was 75 years old . 
Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher began their upbeat performances in Europe , later becoming regulars in Las Vegas , where they would perform for four decades . 
Their revue ended after Horn was attacked on stage by a tiger named Mantecore in 2003 , severing Horn â€™s spine . 
Horn was eventually able to walk again , but he and Siegfried would only perform together one more time -- for a benefit -- before retiring in 2010 .
