Thousands of people gathered in Minsk on Saturday to attend a Victory Day military parade , despite increasing numbers of coronavirus cases in Belarus .

Minsk has set up seating up to 11,000 people , and 3,000 servicemen are also taking part in the parade , according to state run Belarusian news agency Belta . 
Few people were seen wearing masks on the live feed from the parade , aired by Belarusian TV stations . 
President Alexander Lukashenko ’s decision to hold the parade amid the pandemic was met with criticism both abroad and at home , with over 13,000 people signing a petition to cancel the parade and use the funds to buy ventilators for hospitals . 
Lukashenko , who has publicly dismissed other countries ’ coronavirus measures as " psychosis " and declared " it ’s better to die standing than to live on your knees , " addressed the criticism during the ceremony on Saturday . 
" We just could not have done it differently , we had no other choice , and even if we had , we would have done the same thing , " Lukashenko added .
