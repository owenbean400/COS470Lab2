HSBC 's profits plunged in the first half of this year as the bank was weighed down by the coronavirus crisis . 
The London based lender said that pre tax profit in the first half of the year fell 65 % to $ 4.3 billion compared to the same time last year as revenue fell and as credit losses were worse than expected . 
" Our first half performance was impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic , falling interest rates , increased geopolitical risk and heightened levels of market volatility , " CEO Noel Quinn said in a statement .
