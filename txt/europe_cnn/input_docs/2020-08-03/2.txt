Authorities in Italy have found that only 2.5 % of Italians , or 1,482,000 people , have Covid 19 antibodies despite it being one of the countries hardest hit by coronavirus in Europe . 
According to the results of a national survey released on Monday , the northern region of Lombardy , the worse hit by the pandemic , reported the highest number of people with antibodies , 7.5 % , while the two main Italian islands , Sicily and Sardinia , had the lowest number of 0.3 % of the population . 
According to the survey , almost a third of those who tested positive for antibodies were asymptomatic and the most frequent source of infection , in 41.7 % of the cases , is from a relative living in the same house . 
The current number of people with antibodies is six times higher than that registered during the pandemic , said Linda Laura Sabbadini , director of the National Institute for Statistics ( Istat ) . 
More on the survey : The survey , carried out in collaboration with the Italian Red Cross , between May 25 and July 15 , tested blood samples from 64,660 people from 2,000 villages and cities across Italy , split by sex , occupation and age groups . 
The survey did not include people living in health care facilities . 
In May , the government had said the survey would include 150,000 people , but " the health emergency made the survey procedure more complicated , " but still " an incredibly useful source of data , " Sabbadini explained during a press conference .
