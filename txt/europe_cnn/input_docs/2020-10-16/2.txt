The rise in new Covid 19 cases in Europe is far higher than the rise in the US , according to data from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) . 
The surge in the five worst affected European nations was nearly 42 % higher than the increase in the US in the week from October 6 to 13 , according to JHU 's seven day moving average of new cases . 
On October 13 , that daily average in the US stood at 49,542 . 
In the five worst hit European countries -- France , the UK , Russia , Spain and the Netherlands -- the total daily average of new cases stood at 70,158 on the same day . 
The population of the five European countries is 343 million , while the US population is 331 million . 
Europe is in the midst of a second wave of Covid 19 which has spread rapidly across the continent . 
Poland , Belgium and the Czech Republic have all seen sharp increases in Covid 19 infections in recent weeks . 
Poland reported 8,099 new cases on Thursday -- a 24 % increase on the previous day 's tally , itself a record . 
France and the Netherlands have also seen dramatic increases in the numbers of new cases this month . 
But the US situation remains critical . 
The country 's moving average of cases has begun trending upward again after falling from a peak of well over 70,000 in July . 
The JHU data also shows a rapid decline in new cases registered in India , and a notable if less dramatic fall in Brazil .
