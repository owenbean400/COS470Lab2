The Czech Republic now has the highest rate of new coronavirus infections and deaths per capita in the European Union . 
Part of this case count are health care workers who are also testing positive for the virus , creating a shortage of staff at hospitals that are already bursting at the seams . 
The Czech Medical Chamber and the health minister have called on Czech doctors living abroad to return home to help fight the virus . 
Medical students and people with medical training have also been encouraged to come forward . 
More than 1,000 qualified nurses who 've left the profession have offered to come back to help . 
" The health care system in the Czech Republic has already collapsed because hospitals , with a few exceptions , are not able to provide long term care for non Covid patients , " says Jiri Vyhnal , head ER doctor at the Kyjov hospital says . 
Kubek is also hoping for help from abroad . 
But there ’s a problem : When Italy appealed for help from abroad at the peak of its coronavirus outbreak , military doctors and nurse around the world answered the call . 
The Czech Republic did not . 
The military doctors were needed in the country at the time , Czech deputy defense minister Jan Havranek claimed . 
But he admitted that the first wave in the Czech Republic was " rather milld . " 
The next time , he said , the Czech Republic will think harder when another country asks for help . 
Meanwhile , foreign help is on the way with dozens of medical workers from the US National Guard and hundreds from Europe . 
But that is not nearly enough . 
The hospital that ’s supposed to be staffing the second Czech field hospital in Brno said it is stretched so thin that it 's currently negotiating with Germany , Poland and the Red Cross to try to get staff in place .
