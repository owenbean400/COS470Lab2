The British government is prepared to do more to force people to keep apart if necessary , Prime Minister Boris Johnson â€™s spokesperson said Monday . 
Pubs and restaurants were told to close across the UK on Friday to curb the spread of coronavirus , but large numbers of people continued to visit parks and beaches across the UK over the weekend , despite government advice to stay home . 
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday UK citizens who fail to practice government advised social distancing are " very selfish . " 
Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today program , Hancock said : " If people go within two meters of others who they do not live with , then they are helping to spread the virus and the consequence of that costs lives and it means that for everyone this will go on longer . " 
Hancock added that the UK government have been " clear in their actions " in asking the British public to maintain a distance of 2m ( about 6.5 feet ) away from all those they do not live with . 
Watching Europe : Hancock said that the UK government is " looking at what other European countries are doing , " adding : " They are further down the curve . 
They have a higher number of cases than we do here . 
Now that means we can act sooner and earlier in this epidemic but all the way through we have said that we are prepared to take the actions that are necessary and we are . "
