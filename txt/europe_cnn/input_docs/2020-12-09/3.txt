Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , on Wednesday said that for America to start flattening the Covid 19 curve and follow the pattern of Europe , everyone needs to admit and own the problem . 
In some parts of the country , there is almost denial , Fauci said – people thinking that the pandemic is not a big deal , that it ’s fake news , or that it ’s a hoax . 
" It ’s not . 
It ’s real . 
The numbers are absolutely real , " Fauci said , pointing out that there are record numbers of cases , hospitalizations and deaths . 
" We have a serious issue , " he said , coming out of the Thanksgiving holiday and leading up to the Christmas and Hanukkah season .
