Neanderthal DNA may play a small role in swaying the course of Covid 19 infection , recent research has shown . 
Scientists examined a strand of DNA that has been associated with some of the more serious cases of Covid 19 and compared it to genetic sequences known to have been passed down to living Europeans and Asians from Neanderthal ancestors . 
The Neanderthal DNA strand is found on chromosome 3 ; a team of researchers in Europe has linked certain variations in this sequence with the risk of being more severely ill when infected by Covid 19 . 
" It 's exciting for us to find out that Neanderthals had things that are important for us 50,000 years after they went extinct , " said Svante Pääbo , director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , who has been studying Neanderthal DNA for three decades . 
The study also revealed considerable differences in how common this genetic risk variant is in different parts of the world . 
It 's particularly common among people in South Asia , where about half of the population carry the Neanderthal risk variant . 
In Europe , one in six people carry the risk variant , while in Africa and East Asia it is almost nonexistent .
