Lombardy , Italy 's hardest hit region during the first wave of the Covid 19 pandemic earlier this year , will enact a curfew in order to curb a new rise in cases . 
Under the curfew -- which begins Thursday -- nearly all activities and travel in public must cease from 11 p.m . to 5 a.m . Regional authorities also agreed to close shopping centers on weekends , except for stores selling food and basic necessities , to prevent more opportunities for the virus to spread . 
Lombardy is home to the city of Milan and a population of more than 10 million . 
The novel coronavirus took a staggering toll on the region in its earliest days , leading many to call it the pandemic 's epicenter in Europe . 
The elderly population was particularly hard hit . 
Details of exact exemptions , how long the curfew will last and how it will be enforced will be announced in an upcoming regional decree . 
Under the latest government decree , local administrations have the power to enact lockdowns and curfews for their area .
