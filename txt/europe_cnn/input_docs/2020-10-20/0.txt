The coronavirus situation in the Belgian region of Wallonia and the capital Brussels is " close to a tsunami , " the health minister said in a televised interview on Sunday . 
Frank Vandenbroucke warned " the health situation in Wallonia and in Brussels is the worst and the most dangerous in the whole of Europe . " 
Belgium is now on Johns Hopkins University ’s list of 10 countries currently most affected by coronavirus . 
It has the third highest number of Covid related deaths per 100,000 people in the world , sitting behind San Marino and Peru , according to Johns Hopkins University data . 
Vandenbroucke called on all Belgians to protect themselves and their relatives , adding that the epidemic " is no one ’s fault , but improving the situation is everyone ’s duty . " 
However , the health minister defended the government ’s policy of installing a curfew from midnight , and not earlier in the evening , saying that the government " did not want to make life impossible . "
