The five countries with the highest rate of coronavirus infections when measured against population are all in Europe , according to the latest moving averages from Johns Hopkins University analyzed by CNN . 
They are the Czech Republic , Belgium , the Netherlands , Switzerland and France . 
In all five countries , the number of new infections has increased rapidly since the beginning of October and continues to rise . 
On Oct . 19 , the Czech Republic had a rolling daily average ( measured across five days ) of 10,579 new cases . 
That means 988 new infections a day per one million population . 
On Oct . 1 , the rate was 238 per million . 
Not far behind was Belgium , which had an average of 891 new infections per million residents on Oct . 19 . 
At the beginning of the month , that average was just 198 . 
These two countries have by far the highest rate of new Covid 19 infections , but other countries in Europe are seeing steep rises . 
The Netherlands ’ daily average of new cases at the beginning of October was 2,944 ; on Oct . 19 it was 8,277 . 
Measured per million of population , that represents an increase from 172 to 483 in less than three weeks . 
Johns Hopkins lists the 20 countries most affected by the pandemic and in recent days Switzerland has been added . 
Its rolling average of new cases on Oct . 19 was 3,618 – more than seven times higher than the number ( 504 ) on Oct . 1 . 
That equates to 423 new cases daily per million residents . 
Rounding out the most affected countries , France had 381 new cases per million residents on Oct . 19 . 
The United Kingdom has seen a sharp rise in its rolling average this month , from 9,729 new cases to 19,290 per day – which equates to 284 cases per million . 
The picture in Spain is less dramatic but the daily average remains stubbornly high . 
Despite new measures to restrict movement in the most affected areas , the daily average of new cases has only edged down from 14,690 at the beginning of the month to 13,987 on Oct . 19 – 299 per million . 
While infections per million are lower in other European countries , they are still rising . 
Italy , which was one of the worst affected countries earlier in the year , is suffering a new spike . 
Its rolling average of new cases has risen from 2,208 at the start of the month to 11,341 this week . 
Poland is also among the countries listed by Johns Hopkins – its rolling average has more than quadrupled this month . 
More broadly , according to the Johns Hopkins figures , the rolling averages of new cases in India and Brazil continue to fall , while the US is seeing a gradual but persistent rise . 
Its rolling average has risen from 43,089 at the start of October to 59,387 this week , representing 179 new cases a day per million population .
