This week , as younger children across Denmark walked onto school grounds , school bags on their backs and holding parents by the hand , things seemed almost normal . 
Almost . 
Jimmy Skov Glasdam Adetunji , head of secondary education at the Hendriksholm School in Rodovre , just outside Copenhagen , spent Wednesday going through classrooms with a measuring stick to ensure the 440 students could be seated at least two meters ( six feet ) apart when they arrived on Thursday . 
He had split the schoolyard into six sections with red and white barrier tape , and sent a detailed diagram to parents outlining staggered arrival times , routes , breaks and lunch times . 
" I ca not wait to see the kids again , " Adetunji said . 
" But we will obviously have to talk about the pandemic and the rules and why our playground is now marked by police tape . 
So , it 's going to be a contrast between fun and seriousness . " 
A few miles away , in Bronshoj , Philip Mundt was dropping his six year old son Emil for his first day back . 
" He is so excited , " Philip said , laughing . 
" All the way here , he 's been talking about how he 's going to see his friends and that this is the best day of his life . 
He is really looking forward to this . " 
Schools across Denmark raised flags in celebration as they welcomed back younger students this week , with an excitement comparable to a first day of school . 
And it is the first day of school in over a month , after Denmark announced widespread closures on March 11 to contain the spread of the coronavirus . 
The country was among the first in Europe to close borders , shops , schools and restaurants , and to ban large gatherings , among other measures . 
Now , it is one of the first to begin reopening .
