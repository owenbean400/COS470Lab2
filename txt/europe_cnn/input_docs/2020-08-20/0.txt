Sweden recorded its highest death tally in 150 years for the first half of 2020 , according to the country ’s official statistics office . 
Between January and June this year , 51,405 deaths were registered in the country -- more than 6,500 fatalities ( or 15 % ) over the same period in 2019 . 
This is the highest number of deaths in Sweden during the first half of the year since 1869 , when the country was struck by famine and 55,431 people died . 
The country also experienced the lowest population increase since 2005 , with a surplus figure of 6,860 in 2020 that was less than half that of the previous year . 
Immigration figures also saw a reduction of 34.7 % from the same period in 2019 , with the figures primarily dropping in the second quarter between April and June . 
The background : Unlike most countries , Sweden did not go into a lockdown when the pandemic spread across Europe in early spring . 
Instead , there was an emphasis on personal responsibility , with most bars , schools , restaurants and salons remaining open . 
By early June , the country ’s coronavirus death toll was at more than 4,500 . 
According to Johns Hopkins University , it now stands at 5,802 .
