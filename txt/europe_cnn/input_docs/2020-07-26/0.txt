The Spanish government is focused on dialogue with Britain in order to have the Canary and Balearic Islands excluded from the UK 's new quarantine rules , according to Spain 's Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya . 
Speaking to reporters in Madrid on Sunday , Gonzalez Laya said the popular holiday destinations should be excluded because the epidemiological Covid 19 data there is " extremely positive " and " well below data in the UK . " 
Gonzalez Laya added that the Spanish government would not be retaliating against the UK government 's decision , saying it is " not a tit for tat exercise . " 
" If we think that in any country in Europe the epidemiological data requires stricter measures on our side we will do this , " Gonzalez Laya added .
