Global tourism is expected to plunge by 70 % this year , compared to last year , the head of the United Nations World Tourism Organization ( UNWTO ) said Wednesday . 
Previous global crisis situations have caused tourism to decline by 10 % to 20 % , but the Covid 19 pandemic has been worse , said UNWTO Secretary General Zurab Pololikashvili , in a video press conference with reporters in Madrid . 
This summer , more people will take trips by land , rather than on flights , and rural tourism in the mountains , and not on the beaches , may benefit , he said . 
The UNWTO expects more international flights to resume starting in September if the virus is more under control by then , he said . 
Some more details : In a statement on May 11 , the Madrid based UNWTO said its research through late April found that 100 % of the 217 destinations they tracked worldwide had coronavirus related travel restrictions for international tourists . 
As countries begin to reopen for travel , Pololikashvili said Europe will be seen as a model to follow , because it is historically the most visited region , and the best prepared , including its health care infrastructure . 
So called " green corridors " which would permit targeted travel between two regions , in different countries , that have demonstrated low infection rates of Covid 19 , could be a first step to restarting international tourism , he said . 
But Pololikashvili said he prefers to call them " safe corridors , " so that tourists wo not take the virus to their destination and also wo not bring it back home .
