The EU ’s new long term budget will need to be a " strong " response to the coronavirus crisis , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says . 
" I ’ve often said in the past that Europe needs a new Marshall Plan , " she said , referring to the multi billion dollar American stimulus package to rebuild Europe after World War II . " We ’ll need massive public and private investment to revive the economy , reconstruct it and to create new jobs . " 
" The key to this is a strong new EU budget . 
The budget has the advantage that it enjoys the confidence , the trust of all member states . " 
" This new seven year budget has to distinguish itself from the previous ones . 
It will be different . 
It will be the European response to the coronavirus crisis . " 
European Council President Charles Michel said Europe was facing a " huge and unprecedented " crisis . 
He said the bloc ’s leaders would have to focus on " the need – the absolutely necessity – to develop a massive investment strategy " to rebuild once the coronavirus crisis passes .
