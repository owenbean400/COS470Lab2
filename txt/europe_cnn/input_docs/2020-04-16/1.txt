European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday apologized to Italy for the EU not being " there on time " when it needed help at the start of its coronavirus outbreak . 
Von der Leyen , speaking during a plenary session of the European Parliament on coronavirus measures , said : " Yes , it is true that no one was really ready for this . 
It is also true that too many were not there on time when Italy a needed a helping hand at the very beginning . 
And yes , for that , it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology . " 
She added : " But saying sorry only counts for something if it changes behavior . 
The truth is that it did not take long before everyone realized that we must protect each other to protect ourselves . " 
" And the truth is too that Europe has now become the world 's beating heart of solidarity . 
The real Europe is standing up , the one that is there for each other when it is needed the most , " she said . 
Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio responded to her apology on Facebook Thursday , saying : " Ursula Von der Leyen today apologized to Italy , admitting that many countries at the beginning of the pandemic were not present when we needed help . 
Her words represent an important act of truth , which is good for Europe and our community . " 
" Now the European Union has the courage to defend and protect all peoples . 
We need a more supportive Europe ... 
By defending Italy , we also defend the integrity of the EU , " Di Maio added .
