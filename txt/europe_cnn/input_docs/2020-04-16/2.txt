The scramble to find successful treatments to fight coronavirus is disjointed and chaotic , according to Dr . Derek Angus , chair of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine . 
" No , " Angus told CNN when asked if experts have any sense of what has been working in clinical trials . 
" Look , that sounds depressing to say I do not know . " 
Angus , who is leading a Covid 19 trial that ’s testing multiple therapies , said the disorder is at a global level and noted that there are not enough tests right now to practice effective public health . 
" We 've got plenty of ideas about what drugs might work , but we need to test these drugs in trials . 
Otherwise , we 're bungling along not knowing what works , " Angus said . 
There are 94 trials registered for testing the drug hydroxychloroquine , he added . 
" I ’ve never heard of any drug needing 94 separate trials in the same disease , " he said . 
" If you 're trying to do lots of little trials , that 's not as efficient or as useful as trying to do large coordinated trials . 
We 've had over two million confirmed cases of Covid 19 , mainly in North America and Europe . 
And yet , barely more than a few thousand of these two million patients have been enrolled in clinical trials . "
