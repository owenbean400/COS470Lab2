Formula One 's chairman Chase Carey says he plans to start the 2020 season in Austria in July , after the French Grand Prix was called off . 
French Grand Prix organisers announced on Monday that it was impossible for the race to go ahead as planned on June 28 . 
French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this month expanded the country 's ban on major events until at least the middle of July and imposed travel restrictions . 
The 2020 season has yet to begin -- the French Grand Prix is the 10th race to have been canceled or postponed in light of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Carey said in a statement that he was " increasingly confident with the progress of our plans to begin our season this summer " with a view to kicking off in Austria in July -- albeit in all likelihood behind closed doors . 
He added : " We â€™re targeting a start to racing in Europe through July , August and beginning of September , with the first race taking place in Austria on 3-5 July weekend . " 
He said he hoped fans would be part of the events further into the schedule , adding that there were many issues to work out regarding travel to each country . 
British Grand Prix organisers announced on Monday that their event remains on course to take place on July 19 -- but that it will be held without spectators .
