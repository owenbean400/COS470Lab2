Volkswagen -- the world 's largest carmaker by sales -- restarted work at its biggest factory , in northern Germany , on Monday . 
In a statement , VW said 8,000 employees in the city of Wolfsburg began building cars again on Monday , under tight hygiene restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus . 
The company says it expects 1,400 cars to be built this week . 
Next week , production will be ramped up to more than 6,000 cars -- around 40 % of pre crisis levels . 
The company says it has implemented extra hygiene measures at the factory . 
Employees are expected to check their temperature at home every morning , and to change into their overalls at home , to prevent crowding in factory changing rooms . 
Markings on the factory floor will help workers maintain a 1.5 meter distance from each other . 
Where this is not possible , mouth and nose protection must be worn . 
VW says extra time is being provided to allow employees to disinfect tools and surfaces . 
Volkswagen began producing components in several German cities in early April and resumed manufacturing in Germany and Slovakia on April 20 . 
This week the company plans to restart production in Portugal , Spain , Russia , South Africa and South America and from May 3 onwards in Tennessee in the United States .
