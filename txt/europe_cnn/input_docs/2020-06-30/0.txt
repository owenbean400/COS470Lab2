The US is in a worse place today than it was on Memorial Day because of the mixed messages the public has been receiving about the measures needed to control the spread of the coronavirus , former acting director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Dr . Richard Besser said Monday . 
" When you look at where we were Memorial Day [ with ] so many states moving in the right direction , with the numbers of cases going down , part of the country was really trying to use public health guidance as the road map to opening up the economy . 
And then , in other parts of the country , the message being ‘ Get back to work , go out , enjoy your social life , there 's nothing to worry about with this Covid pandemic , ’ " Besser told CNN ’s Jim Acosta on The Situation Room . 
" And when you see that clash of messages between some political leaders and every public health leader taking this so incredibly seriously , when you see that clash of messages , this is the outcome . " 
Coronavirus infection cases are rising in 31 states and reopening measures are being paused or rolled back in 17 states . 
It ’s not too late to change the trajectory , Besser said . 
" It ’s not inevitable that this is going to continue on the trajectory it 's on . 
But it is inevitable if we do not make significant changes , " he said . 
Such changes should include slowing down reopening efforts , wearing masks , keeping six feet apart and good hand hygiene . 
" When I wear a mask , it 's helping to protect you ; when you wear a mask it 's because you care about me . 
If we can get that spirit going there , we can see the same decline in the United States that Europe is seeing , that so many Asian countries are seeing , " he said .
