If Covid 19 had first emerged in Taiwan , the United States or any other open society , it " would have gone very differently , " US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a teleconference from Taipei on Wednesday . 
Azar met with Taiwan ’s President Tsai Ing wen , the Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih chung and members of the Taiwan CDC to discuss Covid 19 during his three day trip to the self ruled island , the highest level visit by a US cabinet official in four decades . 
" My visit to Taiwan is a recognition of its success in combating Covid 19 , and a testament to our shared beliefs that open democratic societies are best equipped to combat infectious disease threats like Covid 19 , " Azar said . 
Criticizing China : In contrast to his praise for Taiwan , Azar was highly critical of the way China handled the initial outbreak . 
Azar also accused China of a month and a half delay in allowing outside experts into the country to learn more about the disease , and pressuring the World Health Organization to stop other countries from establishing border controls and travel restrictions . 
" Even as China imposed internal travel restrictions , [ it still allowed ] their people to travel throughout the world including to Europe , which then allows … travelers in Europe to spread disease across the United States , " Azar said .
