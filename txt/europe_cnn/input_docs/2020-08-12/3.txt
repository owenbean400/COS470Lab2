President Trump said the US is " working with Europe on the difficulties " that countries are facing due to the pandemic , despite the fact that US has more deaths from the virus than any country in the world . 
At a news briefing Wednesday , the President said that countries in Europe have " 40 % higher excess mortality than the United States " and made the case that the US economy is " significantly better than Europe . " 
It â€™s true that the mortality rate is higher in many European countries than it is in the US , but the US has vastly more cases and deaths than any single European country . 
" We 're working with Europe on the difficulties and we are going to help them all the way , we 're doing very well as you know in the vaccines and the therapeutics , " the President said .
