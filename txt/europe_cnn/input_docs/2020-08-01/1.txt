Greece has worked hard to adapt its tourism offering in an age of infection . 
For the time being at least , this seems to be paying off , even as a second wave of infections threatens other European destinations . 
Thanks in part to the fact that it 's so far seen few cases , visiting many parts of Greece right now is almost like visiting a country where Covid 19 never happened . 
Visitors need to complete paperwork before departure , giving details of where they 'll be staying . 
On arrival , they 're subject to random testing and could , if anyone on their flight tests positive , be quarantined for 14 days .
