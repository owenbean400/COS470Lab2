President Donald Trump said the UK was excluded from upcoming US travel restrictions on Europe because of their strong borders and low novel coronavirus infection numbers . 
" One of the reasons UK basically has been ( excluded from the restrictions is ) it ’s got the border . 
It ’s got very strong borders and they ’re doing a very good job , " Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Ireland ’s Leo Varadkar . 
" They do not have very much infection at this point and hopefully they ’ll keep it that way , " he added . 
At least 590 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus , of which eight have died , according to the UK Department of Health .
