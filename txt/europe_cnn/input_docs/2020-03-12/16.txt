European Union leaders said Thursday they disapprove of President Trump ’s decision to ban travel from Europe to the US amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
In a statement , the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission , Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen , respectively , said that the outbreak is a " global crisis , not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action . " 
" The European Union disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation , " the statement read . 
In the UK , Donald Trump ’s decision was received with skepticism by Rishi Sunak , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , who said there " is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of infection . " 
Speaking to the BBC , Sunak – effectively the country ’s Finance Minister – suggested the UK was not considering a similar ban , saying all decisions " with regard to flight bans are always guided by the science . " 
Talking to Talk Radio , Sunak also said the ban " will have significant impact " in the UK ’s economy but only " but temporarily . "
