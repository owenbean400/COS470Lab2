Six time Formula One World Champion , Lewis Hamilton , said on Thursday it ’s " shocking " that Formula 1 has pressed ahead with this weekend 's Australian Grand Prix amid the global coronavirus pandemic . 
" I am really very , very surprised that we 're here . 
I do not think it 's great that we have races but it really is shocking that we 're all sitting in this room , " Hamilton told an official pre race press conference at the circuit venue – Albert Park in Melbourne . 
" It seems that the rest of the world is already reacting a little bit late , but you have seen this morning with ( President Donald ) Trump shutting down the border to Europe to the States , the NBA suspended , yet Formula One continues to go on . " 
Asked why he felt the race was still going ahead as planned , Hamilton replied : " Cash is king . " 
Fellow Formula One driver , Ferrari ’s Sebastian Vettel , who was also in attendance at the same press conference , said : " It is very difficult having a fair judgement , but I do realize a lot of sporting competitions get cancelled and it is fair to ask the question why you are here . 
We have to trust FIA ( Motorsport ’s Governing Body ) and for them to take all the precautions but the answer no one can give you is how much you can control what is going on . " 
Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief Andrew Westacott said in a statement he was " monitoring the situation in conjunction with Formula 1 and the FIA " and working closely with health authorities to take additional precautions at Albert Park , including having hand sanitizers at public areas and corporate facilities . 
The first practice sessions of the new season are due to begin on Friday at Albert Park with the race itself scheduled to take place on Sunday .
