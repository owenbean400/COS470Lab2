The mayor said there have been a lot of conversations over the last few days with Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo ’s office and are making a lot of progress , but indoor dining has to be done safely . 
The final decision on indoor dining will be made by Cuomo who said yesterday that local governments need to have an " enforcement mechanism " in place . 
The mayor noted that indoor dining is a " contributing factor " to recent spikes in Europe . 
" The really important piece of this is our opportunity to do more with indoor dining is directly related to how well we do on the health picture overall . 
If we keep fighting back the coronavirus , more and more options open up . 
If the coronavirus starts to re surge you ’re not going to see a lot of things , including indoor dining , " he said .
