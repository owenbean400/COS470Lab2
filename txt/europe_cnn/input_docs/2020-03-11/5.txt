Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said that coronavirus travel restrictions for Europe are under discussion . 
Cuccinelli pointed out that Europe presents a " unique problem , " because the Schengen zone — the European countries that do not have internal borders and allow people to move between them freely — creates a region " they do not have border for the purposes of travel . " 
He questioned whether it " even makes sense " to treat Italy as a unitary entity .
