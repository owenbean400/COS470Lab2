Netflix said Thursday it will reduce streaming quality in Europe to keep the internet from collapsing under the strain of unprecedented usage . 
But Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said he 's not concerned about the US network 's ability to handle the traffic . 
" So far ( we â€™re seeing ) no congestion in the network , we can handle that , we have built a very robust network , " Vestberg told CNN 's Richard Quest Thursday . 
The company has noted a shift in the types of applications relying on the network : gaming is up 75 % from the prior week , web traffic is up 20 % , VPN usage is up 30 % and streaming is up 10 % . 
In less than one week , 100,000 of Verizon 's 135,000 global employees have shifted to remote working arrangements , but Vestberg said the company remains focused on network up keep . 
" We still have field engineers in the market keeping the network up ... 
We need to keep these networks up because they are so important in this critical moment and this crisis right now , " he said .
