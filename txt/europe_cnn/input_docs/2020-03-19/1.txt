Mainland China on Thursday reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the first time since the the pandemic began , marking a major turning point in the global battle to contain Covid 19 . 
The country reported 34 new cases of coronavirus yesterday -- all imported from overseas . 
The milestone represents a turnaround for the Chinese government . 
Just last month , mainland China was reporting thousands of cases per day , and was considered the most high risk infection area in the world . 
Now , after months of lockdowns and travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens , strict home quarantines , and an unprecedented nationwide effort , the country is down to zero reported new locally transmitted cases . 
Instead , the threat is now coming from overseas . 
The number of cases and deaths outside China have exploded in the past two weeks , with the pandemic hitting the US and Europe particularly hard . 
If China is any model to go by , these countries could have months to go before reaching zero new local transmissions . 
Places like mainland China and Hong Kong are now bracing for a potential second wave of infections , as people return from overseas , bringing the virus with them . 
China also reported eight new deaths yesterday , according to the National Health Commission . 
The country now has a total of 80,928 cases and 3,245 deaths .
