Lily was taking her lunch break at the Dublin nursing home where she works when a friend called with the news that an official looking letter had arrived for her .

Lily said she wanted to cry , but forced the tears back down inside .

" So , I put on a smile but deep down it was incredibly painful . " 
Lily -- whose name has been changed for her safety -- said she fled anti LGBTQ persecution in her native Zimbabwe and came to Ireland in 2016 .
