As coronavirus cases continue to rise in the United States , the nation has " potential " to become the next epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic , Margaret Harris , a spokesperson for the World Health Organization , said during a call with reporters on Tuesday . 
Harris was asked directly : " Do you see the United States going on to become the epicenter of this outbreak , overtaking Europe ? " 
In response Harris said , " We are now seeing a very large acceleration in the numbers of cases from the United States â€” so it does have that potential . 
We cannot say that that is the case yet , but it does have that potential . " 
Earlier in the call , Harris said that the majority of the world 's latest Covid 19 cases have been in European countries and the United States . 
" A lot of countries are now taking very strong measures to distance people , to really quarantine entire societies , and these have been shown to be an important way of slowing down this spread of the virus and buying some time , " Harris said . 
" But to defeat the virus , to stop it , countries also need very aggressive targeted tactics , testing every suspected case , isolating and caring for every person known to be ill and also tracing and quarantining and finding every close contact . "
