Henrik Lerfeldt has fond memories of Kitzloch , a popular restaurant and bar in the Austrian ski resort town of Ischgl , where he partied several nights while on vacation three weeks ago . 
The 56 year old Dane , who spoke to CNN from self quarantine at his home 50 miles from Copenhagen last week , said that his time in Kitzloch in the Austrian province of Tyrol was the way " after ski " is supposed to be . 
" Lots of people , lots of drinks , and nice waiters happy to serve you more . " 
Hundreds of cases : Four days after his return home , Lerfeldt tested positive for the coronavirus , as did one of his friends he was traveling with . 
But they are just two among hundreds of people from all over Europe whose infections are traced back to Ischgl , some of them directly to Kitzloch , according to European authorities .
