Sweden has said 7.3 % of people in its capital Stockholm had developed the antibodies needed to fight coronavirus by late April . 
The statistic is the first published finding of the country ’s study into the antibody levels of its population . 
Sweden ’s chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said the number was a " little lower " than expected " but not remarkably lower , maybe one or a couple of percent . " 
" It squares pretty well with the models we have " he added , while speaking at a news conference in Stockholm . 
The study was carried out to determine the potential herd immunity in the Swedish population . 
It was based on 1,118 tests carried out in one week . 
Sweden 's Public Health Authority aims to carry out the same number of tests every seven days over an eight week period . 
Results from other regions would be released later , a Public Health Authority spokesperson said . 
Sweden adopted a different strategy to other Nordic nations , choosing to keep most schools , restaurants and bars open in a bid to strengthen herd immunity . 
This has culminated in one of the highest death rates per capita in Europe .
