The Philippines has banned medical staff from working in other countries , sparking tensions as the island nation struggles to battle the coronavirus . 
The order , signed by the Labor Secretary on April 2 , prohibits physicians , nurses , medical technicians and other medical staff from working abroad while the country remains under a state of emergency . 
The order says the Philippines sends 13,000 medical workers abroad every year -- yet faces a shortage of 290,000 health workers at home . 
A lot of Filipinos go abroad to work in medicine . 
It can be much more lucrative in North America or Europe , with the average salary for a registered nurse under $ 200 a month in the Philippines , according to the country 's Department of Labor . 
More than 17 % of registered nurses in California are Filipino , a 2017 report found . 
And in the UK , a 2019 government report found there are more than 18,000 Filipinos working in the NHS . 
That 's why they are not happy with the new ban . 
An online petition has already gained 10,000 signatures , protesting the lost economic opportunities for Filipino nurses . 
The petition urged the government to reassess the ban , arguing that the government 's compensation of $ 10 a day for volunteers is not enough to replace wages earned abroad .
