England is at a " tipping point " similar to the first wave of Covid 19 , England 's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam said Sunday in a statement . 
His comments can be linked to the UK in general , given the trajectory of the infection , a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told CNN . 
He also said that the UK now has " much improved testing capabilities , we know in more detail where the disease is , and we have better treatments . " 
The deputy chief medical officer stressed that to " help " the National Health System ( NHS ) it 's necessary to keep the number of Covid 19 cases down . 
To do that people must follow the government guidance : self isolate if they have symptoms , and " at all times " wash their hands regularly , wear face covering in confined spaces , follow the 2 meter social distancing rules and keeping their contacts low . 
The second wave has firmly established itself in Europe and the UK seeing infections soar in the past few weeks . 
On Saturday , British doctors called for mandatory face masks in all offices and outdoors as Covid 19 continues to spread at a " perilous rate " in the UK , the British Medical Association said .
