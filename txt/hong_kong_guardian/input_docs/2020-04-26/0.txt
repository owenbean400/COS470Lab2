A British national has been deported from Singapore and barred from re entering the country after falsely declaring his travel history , according to Channel News Asia . 
The 60 year old man , who is married to a Singapore permanent resident , was also issued a stern warning for the offence of providing false information to a public servant . 
" On 26 March , the police were alerted that the man had made a false declaration of his travel history at the Family Justice Courts , " said a joint statement from the Singapore Police Force ( SPF ) and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority ( ICA ) on Sunday . 
As part of precautionary measures amid the pandemic , the Family Justice Courts requires all visitors to declare their travel history for the last 14 days . 
The man declared that he had not been abroad in the last 14 days , and was hence allowed to enter Family Justice Courts . 
However , he had arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong on 13 March , which was still within the 14 day travel history period at the time of his visit . 
The man was deported to Hong Kong on 26 April , and barred from re entering Singapore .
