Travellers from China face up to six months in jail and a maximum fine of HK$25,000 ( £ 2,491 ) for breaching quarantine measures , Hong Kong ’s government has announced . 
At a press conference on Friday , the chief secretary , Matthew Cheung , said the 14 day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from mainland China is expected to reduce the number of people crossing the border . 
People involved in cross border logistics and workers essential to government services would be exempted from quarantine but monitored closely . 
From Saturday , people entering the city will be required to sign a document consenting to the quarantine measures , while travellers with visas or permits valid for less than 14 days will be barred from entering Hong Kong . 
Cheung stressed the quarantine policy would not affect the flow of goods from the mainland . 
He said : I urge these people , especially those quarantined at home , to have a social conscience and civic responsibility , be cooperative and self disciplined . 
Any rule breakers will be breaking the law . 
One person in Hong Kong has died from coronavirus .
