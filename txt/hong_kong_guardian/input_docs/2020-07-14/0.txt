Charlotte Graham Mc Lay reports for the Guardian from Wellington : After eliminating community transmission of Covid 19 in June , New Zealand ’s government has had the enviable chance to plan for the possibility of a fresh virus outbreak . 
Jacinda Ardern , the prime minister , is making a speech in Wellington during which she is outlining the country ’s plan in case the coronavirus spreads beyond the 25 known cases currently contained at quarantine facilities among travellers returning to New Zealand . 
" We only need to look to Victoria , New South Wales , Hong Kong , Singapore and Korea to see examples of other places that like us had the virus under control at a point in time only to see it emerge again , " Ardern said . 
" This does not mean anyone has failed ... it means perfection in the response to a virus , and a pandemic , is just not possible . " 
She added that New Zealand ’s strategy to quash the virus would remain one of elimination . 
Her government would impose neighbourhood , city , regional , or national lockdowns based on the severity and spread of future cases , she said .
