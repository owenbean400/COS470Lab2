The AHPPC said that with the increased spread of the disease , extending travel bans was " not likely to be feasible or effective . " 
In the past few days , the numbers of cases of COVID 19 in South Korea , Italy , and Iran have been rapidly increasing . 
The AHPPC said the situation in Japan , Hong Kong and Singapore also remains a concern . 
Whilst case numbers in some of these countries are rising quickly , the prevalence of illness is currently orders of magnitude lower than in Hubei Province . 
An assessment of the risk of COVID 19 in those countries is based on many factors , including the identification of transmission chains , the number of reported deaths , recent trends in incidence , the incidence of exported cases and modelled estimates of expected numbers of cases based on travel patterns . 
The ability of countries to respond effectively to infectious disease outbreaks is also an important consideration , along with the feasibility of stringent mobility restrictions given the current phase of the epidemic globally . 
With this change in epidemiology , extending travel bans to restrict travel from multiple countries is not likely to be feasible or effective in the medium term . 
However , it may be appropriate to consider self isolation or practise social distancing upon return from higher risk regions .
