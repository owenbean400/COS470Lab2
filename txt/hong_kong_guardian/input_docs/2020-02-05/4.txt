British nationals on holiday have spoken of their frustration and anxiety of not being able to return to their homes in China . 
Gareth Gough , a teacher who lives in Shenzhen with his wife , got in touch to say they are both stuck in Thailand . 
" There is no certainty when or if we should return and all our stuff is in our apartment , " he said . 
Gough described the Foreign Office travel advice as " frustrating " and said it ’s not clear what it ’s grounded in . 
" A lot of people may not be able to or afford to leave – what about them ? 
Matt Hancock says British people should leave on commercial operations , but also if you come home and have symptoms then stay at home … so which is it ? 
I appreciate its infectious but they have not been very helpful ! " 
Christopher Halkou was on holiday in Vietnam when the Foreign Office changed its advice , " invalidating my insurance if I return to China for work as an English teacher in Shanghai " . 
The 25 year old said after he had two flights cancelled from Vietnam to Shanghai , he made the decision to return to London to assess the situation from there until it was deemed safer to return . 
Halkou added there was a " feeling of uncertainty and precariousness about when I ’ll be returning to Shanghai . 
I have valuables in my flat and rent to pay for so I have to return in some capacity to sort things there even if I decide to terminate my work contract . "
