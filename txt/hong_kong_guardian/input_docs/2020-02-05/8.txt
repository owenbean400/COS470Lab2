Here ’s a report from Josh Taylor , a Guardian reporter based in Melbourne , that the Australian government is considering sending its citizens evacuated from Wuhan to isolated mining camps if Christmas Island reaches capacity for people being quarantined . 
The home affairs minister , Peter Dutton , admitted there is the possibility that Christmas Island could reach capacity if the outbreak continues to spread . 
He said one option would be for people to share rooms , or potentially even open up other locations away from the rest of the Australian population . 
" There are isolated mining camps or the prospect of hotels that you could take over . 
But I think we ’ll look at all of those in order of what we think is the best response , but all of this is in the spirit of preparation . "
