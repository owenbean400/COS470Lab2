There â€™s been praise for the British embassy in Beijing , which is supporting the evacuation process . 
Paul Maloney , who works for the British Council in China , tweeted he was grateful the embassy was able to help evacuate his family , including his young son Theo , who needed an emergency passport in order to travel . 
So grateful to @ ukinchina for their Herculean effort to get my family home from China . 
They got us an emergency passport in half a day . 
So they could travel home . 
Theo â€™s looking forward to see his Grandma now ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‘µ
