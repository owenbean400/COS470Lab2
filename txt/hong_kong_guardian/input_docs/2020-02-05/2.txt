Hong Kong â€™s leader has released more information on the recently announced quarantine for all those arriving from mainland China . 
Carrie Lam said all people entering the semi autonomous territory from the mainland , including Hong Kong residents , will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine because of the outbreak of the new virus , according to a report by AP . 
Lam said the measure will take effect on Saturday to allow Hong Kong day travellers to make necessary arrangements . 
She added that two cruise ship terminals , including one where a ship is under quarantine , will be shut down . 
Lam said the government is looking for more quarantine facilities in addition to the three camps in use and stressed the authorities have remained vigilant and will not shy away from introducing stringent measures to stem the spread of the virus .
