An Australian on a flight out of virus struck Wuhan to Auckland has written for the Guardian on the stress of his evacuation . 
He wrote : I said my goodbyes to my grandparents at the house , they were holding back tears . 
My dad sent me into the airport . 
After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home , and I ’ll look after myself from there on . 
There were a lot of us evacuating , with two or three other countries including us . 
Everyone ’s wearing masks , and it was nerve racking being around so many people in such close proximity . 
Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight , it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport .
