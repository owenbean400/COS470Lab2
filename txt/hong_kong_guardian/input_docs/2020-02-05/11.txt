Some Britons in China have been in touch with the Guardian to say they have no plans to leave the country any time soon . 
Sharon Moan , a chemistry teacher who lives with her husband and two children in Shanghai , said she is baffled by the foreign office ’s advice . 
" Life here is very calm . 
We have few restrictions and feel that everything the local government has put in place is for everybody ’s benefit . 
We actually only began to panic when we read Western media news reports that do not reflect what is happening here . 
We do not feel it ’s necessary and many of our colleagues feel the same . 
" We feel unsupported by the consulate as there is no clear explanation as to why they have made this announcement . 
This is our home and the foreign office has not actually given us a good reason to leave it . 
We have no plans to leave and will carry on regardless . " 
Dr Rob Burton , a 65 year old academic living in a state of self quarantine in Hangzhou with his Chinese wife , said he is under no illusion that she would be allowed entry to the UK . 
" I have a life here and my semester at the Communication University of Zhejiang is due to start on 24 February . 
I feel that the attitude by the foreign office towards British nationals who are married to foreign spouses is toxic . 
I ’m not going to say goodbye to my wife and leave her stranded on her own . 
Who would do that ? 
It would actually be easier for me to get my English dog , Snooky , and Chinese cat , Fluffy Bum ( named in honour of Spike Milligan ) , home than it would my wife . 
" I was actually in Wuhan in November so have had a few weeks of wondering if I have been infected . 
We have been inside for 15 days now and have only been to the supermarket twice . 
It becomes a psychological test as you become more stir crazy as the rumours mount up . 
That said , there is a huge effort going on by ordinary Chinese people which I do not see much about in the foreign press . "
