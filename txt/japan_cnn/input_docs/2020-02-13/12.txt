CNN 's Will Ripley spoke to a father quarantined on board the Diamond Princess in Japan with 10 family members , including kids , to get a look at what daily life looks like on that ship . 
Harvey , who asked that CNN not use his last name , has five kids on the ship with him â€” the youngest is 3 , the oldest is 8 . 
The kids are forced to spend 23 hours in their room . 
They get a daily delivery of clean toys and coloring books . 
Harvey said being " trapped in this cabin " has made him " appreciate the little moments , little details of life . " 
He said they told their children that they need to do this to protect themselves from an " invisible monster " called coronavirus . 
So far , nobody in the family is showing any symptoms of novel coronavirus , but Harvey wants everyone in his family to be tested . 
The Japanese government has only tested a few hundred of the 3,000 people on board . 
He worries that if everyone on board the ship is not tested , they 'll be stigmatized when they get back home to Hong Kong .
