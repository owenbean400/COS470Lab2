Mori added that the organizing committee has set up a task force that has begun " sharing information for the prevention of the infection . " 
A senior organizer had previously warned that the outbreak could impact Japan 's preparations for the Games . 
" I am extremely worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games , " said Toshiro Muto , chief executive of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee , according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK . 
" I hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible . "
