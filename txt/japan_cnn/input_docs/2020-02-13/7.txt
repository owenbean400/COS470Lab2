The Indian Ambassador to Japan has responded to concerns from Indian crew members onboard the Diamond Princess that they are being exposed to undue risk by continuing to work and eat in a communal mess hall . 
Sanjay Kumar told CNN on Thursday that while he acknowledges the risk from eating together , he said he " had no reason to believe " the crew were in danger . 
" While they are eating , yes it is one risk in which they eat all together , " Kumar said . 
" So I cannot rule out the transmission of the virus in that mess where they are eating . " 
" But for me to say anything beyond that would not be good because I am not there , and the Japanese authorities have a quarantine requirement , which they are following , " he continued . 
Fears of greater risk for crew : On Wednesday , Diamond Princess security guard Sonali Thakkar expressed concern that the coronavirus could spread between crew members , especially when they remove their masks to eat together . 
As the quarantine of the vessel continues in Japan 's Yokohama , more than 1,000 crew members remain at work , providing for and interacting with potentially infected passengers and taking care of the ship . 
Kumar said there are 132 Indian crew and six guests on board , of which two of those crew members have tested positive and been taken to local hospitals . 
The embassy says they are in touch with those on board . 
Cases increasing every day : A total of 44 more cases were confirmed on the Diamond Princess on Thursday , bringing the total from the ship to 219 -- the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside of mainland China .
