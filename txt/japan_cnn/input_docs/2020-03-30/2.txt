Tokyo 2020 organization committee president Yoshiro Mori said he expects International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) president Thomas Bach to call with the new date for the postponed Olympics within the week . 
Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Bach last week agreed to postpone the Olympics until 2021 . 
The IOC had been facing mounting pressure to delay the Games , which were originally scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9 , amid the novel coronavirus outbreak . 
Mori made the remarks at the beginning of the first Executive Board meeting of Tokyo 2020 since the postponement was announced . 
Two possibilities for the games : Organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said that the Executive Board discussed two possibilities for the games - in spring or summer of 2021 - but denied there was any discussion on a specific starting date . 
Muto said the postponement might mean the same locations are reserved twice , resulting in " considerable " amount of additional costs . 
He added Tokyo 2020 will continue discussions with the IOC on any final decisions .
