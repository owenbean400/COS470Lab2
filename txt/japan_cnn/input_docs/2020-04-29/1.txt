Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ’s campaign to distribute free , reusable cloth masks amid chronic shortages has been met with complaints that they are stained and dirty . 
The number of damaged masks intended for pregnant women in Japan had risen to 30,000 out of 500,000 by Tuesday , according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK . 
The masks are being dispatched in order of priority , with pregnant women at the top of the list , and are part of a wider plan to send two reusable cloth masks to roughly 50 million households in the country . 
Quality check underway : Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday , Japanese health minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters the safety of the masks would be checked . 
Public backlash : Earlier in April , Abe ’s mask proposal attracted outrage and mockery online , with the hashtag " Abe ’s mask " and " screw your two masks " trending on Twitter . 
Many dubbed the policy " Abenomask policy " as satirical memes showing well known cartoon characters sharing one mask between four family members popped up online . 
This post has been updated to reflect the number of damaged masks .
