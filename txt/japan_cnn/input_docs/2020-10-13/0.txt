Like many travelers around the world , Jesse Takayama found his dream trip thwarted by the spread of Covid 19 . 
But after an unexpected seven month stay in Peru , he is finally crossing " visit Machu Picchu " off of his bucket list . 
Takayama , a native of Osaka , Japan , arrived in the Peruvian town of Aguas Calientes on March 14 . 
He already had his entry ticket and permit to enter the UNESCO World Heritage site on March 16 . 
Then , the Peruvian government opted to close the site -- and Takayama was stranded . 
Since then , Takayama has become a local in Aguas Calientes , where he has been renting an apartment for the past seven months . 
However , as he started to run out of money , it looked like Takayama would have to head back home without ever having used his Machu Picchu ticket . 
Enter Andean Roots Peru , a local tour company . 
With help from the national Ministry of Culture , Takayama was given special permission to enter Machu Picchu -- and to have the normally crowded site nearly all to himself . 
He was accompanied by two photographers who documented the experience . 
" The Japanese citizen has entered together with our head of the park so that he can do this before returning to his country , " Peru 's Minister of Culture Alejandro Neyra told reporters .
