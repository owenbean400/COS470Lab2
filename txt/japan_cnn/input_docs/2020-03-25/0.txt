As of 11:45 p.m . ET , there have been more than 422,000 people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide , and over 18,900 have died , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University , which is tracking World Health Organization ( WHO ) figures and additional sources . 
Mainland China still has the most cases of any country -- as of the end of the day Tuesday 81,218 people there have been infected , 3,281 of whom died and 73,650 of whom recovered -- but the numbers in hard hit Italy are getting closer . 
More than 69,000 people have been infected in Italy and at least 6,820 have died , according to Johns Hopkins . 
The next epicenter : While Italy is the current epicenter of the virus , the WHO said it is possible it could shift to the United States . 
Last Wednesday , there were about 3,500 cases in the US , according to the WHO . 
As of late Tuesday night ET , the country has at least 52,976 cases across all 50 states , the District of Columbia , Guam , Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands , according to a CNN tally . 
At least 705 people have died , including 210 in New York , 123 in Washington state and 46 in Louisiana . 
The increase is likely due in part to both the virus ' exponential spread and increased testing efforts country wide . 
The planet stays home : To combat the virus ' spread , authorities across the US are ordering most residents to stay at home -- 55 % of the nearly 330 million people living in the country will be subject to such measures . 
They 're not alone -- a staggering 2.5 billion people -- nearly a third of the world â€™s population -- are under coronavirus related movement restrictions . 
The most audacious of all these stay at home orders is likely in India , which has asked the majority of its 1.3 billion population to stay home for 21 days . 
The 2020 Games , in 2021 : On Tuesday , the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo would be postponed until next year . 
They agreed to keep the name as Tokyo 2020 and said the Olympic flame would stay in Japan . 
The Olympics have never been rescheduled in peacetime . 
In 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , the Games were canceled because of world wars . 
As Japan now prepares for the logistical nightmare that is rescheduling one of the world 's biggest and most popular events , Tokyo 2020 organizing committee chief executive Toshiro Muto said Tuesday that it was unclear who would cover the additional costs arising from pushing back the Games .
