The organizers of a mixed martial arts competition held in front of 6,500 fans at an indoor arena in Japan are facing a backlash after ignoring calls for its cancellation . 
The " K 1 World GP " event went ahead at the Saitama Super Arena on Sunday , defying government guidelines on social distancing and large public gatherings . 
Saitama prefecture requested the event be canceled before it was held and relayed the message to the Saitama Super Arena , which provides guidelines to events organizers on its website , but does not enforce a ban on public gatherings . 
The K1 event organizers insisted they would take adequate measures to protect the thousands of attendees from the novel coronavirus by providing masks and making sure hand sanitizer was available , in a statement released on March 19 . 
On that same day , a central government expert panel called on organizers of large scale events to exercise caution , including canceling plans , to prevent the spread of the coronavirus .
