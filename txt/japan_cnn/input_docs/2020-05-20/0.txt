Japan recorded 31 new coronavirus cases and eight deaths on Tuesday , raising the national total to 16,925 infections and 784 deaths . 
Tuesday was the 10th consecutive day that fewer than 30 new cases were recorded in the country . 
Daily new cases have been steadily declining over the past month ; just weeks ago Japan was still reporting between 100 and 300 cases a day . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe first declared a state of emergency in several affected prefectures on April 7 , before extending it to the entire country on April 16 . 
The measure was lifted last week for most prefectures . 
It remains in place in eight hard hit prefectures , including Tokyo and Osaka . 
Tomorrow , the government is expected to decide whether and when to lift the state of emergency in those places .
