President Donald Trump has become the first world leader to suggest postponing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the coronavirus pandemic spreads .

However , he said he would not relay the message to Japan ’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , according to Japan ’s public broadcaster NHK . 
The pair held telephone talks Friday Japan local time . 
In response to Trump ’s comments , Japan ’s Olympics minister , Seiko Hashimoto , stressed the preparations for a " safe and secure " Games was still underway . 
" I ’m aware of President Trump ’s remarks , however , neither the IOC nor the organizing committee has considered any postponement or cancellation of the Games , " she said .
