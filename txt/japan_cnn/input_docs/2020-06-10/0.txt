Japanese tech conglomerate Soft Bank just conducted voluntary Covid 19 antibody tests on more than 44,000 employees , their families , clients and outside medical professionals such as doctors and dentists . 
The company says it is the largest such test by a Japanese company . 
To combat another possible wave of cases , " various tests are needed to ensure the safety of our employees and society , so that we can find an exit strategy as quickly as possible , " said Soft Bank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son during a live streaming event on Tuesday . 
He cautioned that a vaccine for the virus might not be able to be mass produced until " the middle of next year . " 
Soft Bank on Tuesday said that of the 44,066 people it tested for Covid 19 antibodies , 191 tested positive . 
Among Soft Bank staff , just 0.04 % of employees working at Soft Bank 's mobile carrier retail stores tested positive , a number Son said was surprising . 
The rate of positive tests among workers people at the Japanese firm 's office and call centers was slightly higher , though not by much : about 0.2 % and 0.4 % , respectively .
