A Japanese virus expert says he is " pessimistic " that the postponed Tokyo Olympics will go ahead as planned next year . 
Kentaro Iwata says that even if Japan can get the outbreak under control in time , there is no guarantee that other competing countries will be in a similar position . 
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) confirmed in March that the Games would be pushed back to 2021 because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . 
It is the first time in history that the Olympics have been postponed during peacetime . 
The Games of 1916 , 1940 and 1944 were all canceled because of world wars . 
" To be honest with you , I do not think the Olympics is likely to be held next year , if held anytime , " said Iwata , professor of infectious diseases at Kobe University . 
" Japan might be able to control this disease by next summer , and I wish we could , but I do not think that would happen everywhere on Earth , so in this regard I 'm very pessimistic about holding the Olympics Games in next summer . "
