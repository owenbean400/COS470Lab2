Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will declare a state of emergency on Tuesday , lasting for approximately one month , he announced Monday . 
Abe will hold a press conference on Tuesday to further explain the declaration . 
A different tactic : Abe says Japan ’s state of emergency will differ from Western countries , adding that " basic economic activity " will continue , giving examples including public transportation and supermarkets . 
The Prime Minister ’s advisory committee recommended that a state of emergency be declared for seven Japanese prefectures , including the Japanese capital of Tokyo and its second largest city Osaka . 
The full list of prefectures affected is : Tokyo , Kanagawa , Saitama , Chiba , Osaka , Hyogo and Fukuoka . 
Economic relief : Abe also announced details of a massive JPY ¥ 108 trillion ( USD $ 989 billion ) economic stimulus package . 
The size of the economic relief package — 20 percent of Japan ’s GDP — is unprecedented . 
The stimulus includes JPY ¥ 6 trillion ( USD $ 54 billion ) in cash handouts for families who have lost significant income and small business owners . 
Also included , JPY ¥ 26 trillion ( USD $ 238 billion ) in extension of deadlines for tax and social welfare payments . 
Zero interest loans will also be provided to private financial institutions , but Abe did not specify the amount .
