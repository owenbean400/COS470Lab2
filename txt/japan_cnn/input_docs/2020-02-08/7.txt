A CNN reporter in Yokohama , Japan , near the Diamond Princess overheard the captain announcing a plan to improve conditions aboard the ship , including medical supplies , better internet signal and a hotline for people to call for emotional support . 
The Japanese military would carry out a transfer of test results and medicine into the cruise ship to top up people 's prescriptions , he said . 
He also said he appreciated letters of support from people on board , and read out the phone number for the emotional support hotline . 
He said the cruise ship was due to arrive in Yokohama Port at 9 a.m . Sunday and that extra medical staff would come on board to help with prescriptions and tests . 
He said he would allow guests to get out onto the deck again on Sunday . 
Passengers had told CNN earlier that they were being confined to their cabins , except for around one hour a day where they could leave their rooms under supervision .
