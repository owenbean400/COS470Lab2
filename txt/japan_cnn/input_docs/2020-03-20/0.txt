CNN Correspondent Will Ripley is joining the town hall from Tokyo , Japan -- where a debate is ongoing on the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics . 
" In less than an hour the Olympic Torch is going to be arriving here in Japan . 
And officials continue to insist they 're moving forward to host the Olympics on schedule at the end of July , " Ripley said . 
" Can the world feel confident given , you know , we 're seeing such limited testing here ? " 
Will the Olympics go ahead ? 
The coming weeks will tell : " I have no reason to believe they 're not making progress in Japan , " said Mike Ryan , director of the World Health Organization 's Health Emergencies Program . 
" And the Olympics is a major global event . 
And I think Japan still has hope the Olympics will happen , but that is going to be based on a risk management decision . 
And obviously the government of Japan will not make a decision to go ahead if there is danger to athletes , danger to spectators . 
And a lot of that will depend on how the disease evolves in the coming few weeks . "
