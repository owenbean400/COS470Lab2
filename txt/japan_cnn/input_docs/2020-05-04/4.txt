Japan will extend its state of emergency until May 31 , but the country must prepare for a " life with coronavirus , " Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a task force meeting today . 
Some prefectures with a high infection rate , including Tokyo and Osaka , will keep working to reduce social contact by 80 % to stem the spread of the virus . 
The rest of the nation may begin easing restrictions for small businesses , such as restaurants and cultural facilities , with appropriate prevention measures . 
Abe said he will review the infection status around May 14 to see if the order can be lifted earlier . 
He said the country â€™s " unique " approach of cluster tracing during lockdown has helped it avoid what he called an explosive outburst of infection seen in other countries . 
Japan 's state of emergency gives the authority to local governors to request residents stay indoors and suspend businesses , although it cannot force lockdown measures with penalties .
