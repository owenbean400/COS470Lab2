As international criticism mounts of its handling of the Diamond Princess cruise ship crisis , the Japanese government has released data to back up its quarantine strategy . 
In a report from the government funded National Institute of Infectious Disease ( NIID ) , newly released data claims widespread transmission between passengers and crew had dropped after quarantine was put in place . 
The report showed that the onset of confirmed cases of Covid 19 peaked on February 7 before sinking to zero by February 15 . 
The report said cases among crew peaked on February 13 . 
" The decline in the number of confirmed cases , based on reported onset dates , implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers , " it said . 
At least 626 cases of the coronavirus have been linked to the ship , including the deaths of two Japanese passengers in their 80s . 
' Ongoing risk ' : The report comes after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said Japan â€™s quarantine measures might not be sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship . 
The CDC said that all US passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions , preventing them from returning to the US for at least 14 days after they have left the Diamond Princess .
