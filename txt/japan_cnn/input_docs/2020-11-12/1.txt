Tokyo 2020 is working with the Japanese government to ensure that athletes and Olympic staff can avoid a 14 day quarantine on arrival in Japan ahead of the games , Toshiro Muto , the CEO of Tokyo 2020 , said at a press briefing Thursday . 
The aim is for the athletes and workers to be able to train and work in the lead up to the Olympics , which is due to be held in Summer 2021 . 
The athletes will likely still need to follow preventative measures , such as being tested for coronavirus before they 're able to travel to Japan and will likely need to submit an activity schedule to organizers , according the organization committee . 
Tokyo 2020 and the Japanese government are also hoping to implement Covid 19 prevention protocols to exempt foreign spectators from a 14 day quarantine on arrival to Japan as it is " impossible " to impose self isolation rules on visitors . 
The organizers announced that the maximum number of spectators allowed at the Olympic venues will be decided in spring . 
Those numbers will depend on the Covid 19 infection rates in Japan and across the world .
