Hawaii has tightened a program that allowed out of state visitors to avoid quarantine , just over a month after it was first put into place . 
" We â€™re taking this added safety precaution now in response to the dramatically increasing number of Covid 19 cases in the continental United States and around the world , " said Hawaii Gov . 
David Ige . 
Currently , travelers from the US and Japan can avoid a full 14 day quarantine if they get a Covid test before traveling , and it comes back negative at any point during their stay . 
But starting next Tuesday , visitors must have their negative result in hand before they get on the plane in order to move around freely in Hawaii . 
Anyone who arrives in the state without a negative coronavirus test already filed must adhere to the full 14 day quarantine , even if a negative result comes back before the quarantine period is over . 
Even though the rules are being tightened , the quarantine exemption program itself is expanding . 
Starting in mid December , the program will also be available to travelers from Canada . 
All eligible fliers must take a Covid 19 test within 72 hours of travel from a provider designated by the state .
