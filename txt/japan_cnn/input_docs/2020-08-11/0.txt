The Japanese Ministry of Health said 842 new cases of Covid 19 were identified on Monday , the first time in 13 days that the number of infections reported in a day dropped below quadruple digits . 
Positive signs also emerged in Tokyo , where many of the new cases have been recorded . 
The Japanese capital recorded 196 infections Monday , the first time the daily case count there has dropped below 200 in two weeks . 
Five coronavirus related deaths were reported throughout the country on Monday , authorities said . 
To date , 49,630 cases of the virus have been identified in Japan and at least 1,065 people have died . 
An important caveat : Economic Minister Yasunori Nishimura , who is in charge of the nation 's coronavirus policies , said in a news conference on Tuesday that the drop in cases could be due to the fact that fewer tests were conducted over a holiday weekend . 
Nishimura called for continued vigilance and asked citizens to abide by safety measures in their daily lives , as the recent infections have been taking place more in offices , schools and during social activities .
