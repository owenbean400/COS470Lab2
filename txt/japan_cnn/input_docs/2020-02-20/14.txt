US citizens who were on board the Diamond Princess cruise and tested positive for the novel coronavirus must be cleared per US guidelines before returning home , according to letters sent by the US embassy in Tokyo to these passengers . 
These guidelines were sent to at least one American passenger who is still in Japan . 
The US began evacuating some passengers earlier this week . 
In order to be eligible to board a US bound flight , three key criteria must be met : This is in line with existing guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on when to release patients from isolation in hospitals . 
" You will not be cleared to travel simply by waiting 14 days , " the embassy specified . 
Fourteen days is the upper estimate of the virus â€™ incubation period . 
These criteria are set by the CDC and the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
Carnival Corporation , which owns and operates the Diamond Princess cruise ship , has agreed to cover testing costs for these passengers if the Japanese government does not , according to the letters . 
After submitting test results to the CDC , passengers must wait to receive notification by a US embassy representative notifying them they are cleared to fly to the US . 
For the rest of those aboard , CDC said on Tuesday that " all passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions , preventing them from returning to the United States for at least 14 days after they had left the Diamond Princess . "
