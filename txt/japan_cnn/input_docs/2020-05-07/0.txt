Japan is set to fast track approval for the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for coronavirus patients . 
Japan ’s relatively speedy move to approve remdesivir follows on from the United States , which authorized the emergency use of the drug to treat coronavirus patients last Friday . 
It will be the first drug licensed in Japan to treat coronavirus patients . 
Japanese health minister Katsunobu Kato said on Tuesday that a panel of experts would meet Thursday so that the drug ’s approval could be completed as soon as possible . 
In Japan , the approval process for an experimental drug usually takes up to a year , but given the urgency of the situation , officials are shortening that time period to a week , according to public broadcaster NHK . 
Only drugs that have been approved by other countries can be fast tracked for use in Japan , NHK reported . 
Remdesivir , made by US based Gilead Sciences , was tested against Ebola -- but with little success . 
A US government funded study conducted in April found that coronavirus patients who took remdesivir recovered faster than patients who did not . 
It improved recovery time for coronavirus patients from 15 to 11 days . 
But beyond the initial optimism , the study also made clear that remdesivir is far from a cure for Covid 19 as it does not prevent death and is not yet widely available to the public .
