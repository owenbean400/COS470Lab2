A Singaporean citizen returning to the country from Japan on December 21 became the first person in the world to use a digital Covid 19 health certificate while crossing the border , the companies behind the pass said in a statement . 
According to International SOS , the International Chamber of Commerce , and AOKpass , an unidentified passenger on Singapore Airlines flight SQ637 was able to use the ICC AOKpass to officially present a negative Covid 19 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test upon arrival at Changi Airport â€™s immigration counters . 
" Following the successful pilot program , all travelers , starting with Malaysia and Indonesia will now be able to use ICC AOKpass to digitally authenticate their COVID 19 test results , as well as any other necessary health credentials during immigration at Changi Airport , " the statement said , adding that digital certificates were a major leap forward compared to the paper passes that have been used previously . 
In the statement , Chester Drum , cofounder of AOKpass , said " as we look towards the revival of widespread international travel and trade , there is an urgent need for a common framework in certifying , authenticating and securing the results of a Covid 19 test for air transport stakeholders and local health authorities . " 
Many countries require passengers to demonstrate proof of a negative Covid test before traveling , and as vaccines are rolled out worldwide , immigration authorities may begin to ask for certification that people have been vaccinated against the infection .
