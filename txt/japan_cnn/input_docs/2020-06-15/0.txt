New research from Japan suggests that many coronavirus clusters outside of hospitals may have been started by people who are younger than 40 or do not feel sick . 
The findings offer insight into who might be driving coronavirus transmission -- and they underscore the importance of certain measures , such as face coverings , to slow the spread of Covid 19 . 
Researchers behind the study looked at more than 3,000 coronavirus cases in Japan . 
They identified 61 clusters linked to places such as health care facilities , restaurants , bars , workplaces and music events . 
A cluster was defined as five or more cases where people were exposed at a common venue â€“ not including transmission within a household . 
The researchers identified 22 patients who likely started clusters outside of hospitals ; half of them were between 20 and 39 years old . 
That is " younger than the age distribution of all COVID 19 cases in Japan , " according to the study . 
The research was published last week as an " Early Release " in Emerging Infectious Diseases , a journal from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
That means it could see changes before being published . 
Overall , the study found 18 clusters linked to health care facilities and ten linked to other care facilities such as nursing homes and day care centers . 
Ten additional clusters were from restaurants or bars , eight were from workplaces , and seven were from music related events such as live concerts , chorus group rehearsals and karaoke parties .
