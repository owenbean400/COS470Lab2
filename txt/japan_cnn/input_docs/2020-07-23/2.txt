South Korea has fallen into recession as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on all of the world ’s major economies . 
The Asian economy shrank 3.3 % in the April to June period compared to a quarter prior , the Bank of Korea announced Thursday . 
It marked a second straight quarter of declines .

Japan entered recession earlier this year — that country was already struggling before the outbreak because of a sales tax hike and the aftermath of a powerful typhoon . 
China ’s economy , meanwhile , averted recession by growing last quarter . 
But the data still suggested that the recovery is slow , and that people are still nervous about leaving their homes .
