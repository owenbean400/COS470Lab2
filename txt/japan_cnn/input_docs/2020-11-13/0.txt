Japan reported 1,649 new Covid 19 cases Thursday , the highest single day number of cases in the nation . 
But Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the current situation still does not require the reintroduction of a state of emergency or the cancellation of the government 's campaign to boost domestic tourism . 
An expert panel advising Suga said part of the reason the country is not declaring a state of emergency yet is because the virus is not spreading particularly fast and hospitals are not that full . 
Hospital bed occupancy is just above 10 % and the rate of new infections is fewer than five people for every 100,000 . 
The country ’s northernmost prefecture and island , Hokkaido , saw the highest number of new infections at 236 cases for Thursday . 
Tokyo posted 393 new cases on Thursday , the Japanese capital 's highest since August 8 , while Japan ’s second biggest city , Osaka , reported 231 new infections . 
The nationwide total stands at 114,010 cases .
