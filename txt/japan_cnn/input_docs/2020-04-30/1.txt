The Tokyo Olympics are not contingent on the development of a coronavirus vaccine , John Coates , the head of the International Olympic Committee 's coordination commission for the Games , said on Wednesday . 
Australia ’s Olympic Committee has verified Coates ' remarks . 
His comments came after Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori said earlier this week that the Games could be canceled if the pandemic is not over by next summer . 
Earlier this week , the president of Japan ’s Medical Association , Dr . Yoshitake Yokokura , told reporters it will be " difficult to hold the Olympics " without a vaccine for the novel coronavirus . 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe echoed this on Wednesday , saying it would be " impossible " to hold the Olympics unless the pandemic was contained . 
The rescheduled Games are due to open on July 23 , 2021 .
