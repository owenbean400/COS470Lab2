A total of 14 passengers were confirmed to have the novel coronavirus as they were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and left the country on a flight chartered by the US government , according to a joint statement by the US Departments of State , and Health and Human Services . 
The US government arranged the jet to evacuate American passengers stuck on the ship , and more than 300 people boarded the plane , which left Japan yesterday . 
Americans who had already tested positive for coronavirus were not be allowed to board the evacuation charters . 
Here 's what the statement said : More than 3,600 people , including 428 Americans , were stuck on the ship after revelations earlier this month that a passenger on board had been infected with the virus . 
At least 46 Americans are among the 356 people infected with coronavirus aboard the Diamond Princess and will remain in Japanese hospitals . 
Passengers onboard the chartered flight will undergo two weeks of quarantine upon arrival in the US . 
That decision by the US government prompted anger from some exhausted passengers .
