White House officials are expected to ask Congress for emergency funding this week to battle the coronavirus amid growing fears of a larger outbreak in the US , two officials familiar with the forthcoming request said . 
Government aides worked throughout the weekend on the supplemental request , which is still not final but could be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as Monday , said a person familiar with the plans . 
That source said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has ruffled feathers through the process by requesting amounts of money that " have been seen as largely out of proportion . " 
The source noted HHS already has money that could be used for coronavirus issues , but claimed Azar " has been pushing hard for this to overcompensate " for management decisions regarding coronavirus containment that the source criticized . 
By the numbers : The US now has 36 confirmed cases of coronavirus . 
Fourteen Americans who tested positive for the disease returned to the US this week after spending weeks in isolation on the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess docked in Japan . 
A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment . 
The supplemental funding request was first reported by Politico .
