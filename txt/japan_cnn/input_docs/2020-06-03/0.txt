South Korea has approved imports of the antivirus drug remdesivir , the country ’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in a news release on Wednesday . 
Authorities said the decision was made because the drug had meaningfully shortened the treatment period for severe cases of Covid 19 in the United States , Japan and United Kingdom during the pandemic . 
Remdesivir has helped speed up recovery in moderately ill patients with pneumonia from Covid 19 , drugmaker Gilead Sciences said Monday . 
Remdesivir is approved to treat Covid 19 in Japan , but is considered an investigational treatment for Covid 19 elsewhere in the world , Gilead said in a statement . 
South Korea ’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) will negotiate with drug importer Gilead Science Korea to import the drug as soon as possible , the release said .
