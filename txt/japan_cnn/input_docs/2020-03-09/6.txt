Japan 's Nippon Professional Baseball League ( NPB ) will delay the start of the season , originally scheduled for March 20 , due to the coronavirus outbreak , it said Monday . 
" I personally believe that we have no choice but to postpone at this stage â€¦ We are aiming to open the season in April , " NPB Commissioner Atsushi Saito said at a press conference . 
The 12 team league had been playing its pre season games without fans because of the virus . 
The league last postponed the start of its season in 2011 after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant was damaged by a tsunami .
