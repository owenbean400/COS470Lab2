Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called on citizens to refrain from visiting nightlife entertainment venues as the country sees increasing spikes in coronavirus infections . 
Speaking at a meeting of the national coronavirus task force on Saturday , Abe asked people to avoid going to evening spots such as nightclubs and bars and follow the social distancing guidance . 
Abe also urged businesses in seven prefectures , including Tokyo , to cut down the number of people going to the office by at least 70 % and implement work from home systems . 
The prime minister on Tuesday said Japan needs to reduce 70-80 % of human contacts in the next two weeks to reverse the increasing trend of new coronavirus cases . 
Despite Abe ’s plea , urban cities in the country have not seen a drastic reduction in the number of commuters . 
State of emergency declared : Japan issued a state of emergency on April 7 for a month across seven virus hit prefectures but it carries no penalties for people venturing out for non essential work . 
Earlier on Saturday , Japan ’s health ministry reported 658 new confirmed coronavirus cases and six deaths by the end of Friday .
