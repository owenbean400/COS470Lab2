Japanese automaker Toyota announced that it will start producing 500-600 medical face shields per week using injection molds and 3D printing , with plans to ramp up production over time . 
These measures will be largely carried out in Japan , though there are also similar efforts being made in overseas factories and branches . 
The statement said Toyota will leverage its supply chain to distribute thermometers and other protective equipment . 
The firm is also working with ventilator manufacturers to try and increase productivity . 
Toyota is also considering using its vehicles to transport people from their homes to medical facilities or quarantine centers , so fewer potentially infected people are on public transit or taxis .
