In a strong statement , Israel 's health ministry warned that nine South Korean tourists who visited the country recently have tested positive for coronavirus upon returning home . 
The ministry called on anyone who may have come into close contact with the tour group for an extended period of time to self quarantine . 
The tourists visited some of the most popular sites in Israel and the West Bank from February 8 to 16 , increasing the chance of a large scale exposure in the region , the ministry said Saturday . 
Providing a list of dates and locations , the ministry warned that anyone who came within two meters of the group for more than 15 minutes should self quarantine for 14 days . 
The group visited Masada in southern Israel , the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron , and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem . 
The potential for a large scale exposure appears to be high given the number of tourists who regularly visit these sites and others . 
The release of the statement on a Saturday is an indication of how seriously authorities are taking the threat of coronavirus spreading in Israel . 
Government statements are rarely released on Saturday in Israel since it is the Sabbath . 
This comes after Israel announced its first case of the coronavirus on Friday . 
The victim is an Israeli woman who returned from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan . 
She was one of 11 passengers flown back from the Diamond Princess . 
The other 10 tested negative for the virus . 
All of the passengers remain quarantined in hospital .
