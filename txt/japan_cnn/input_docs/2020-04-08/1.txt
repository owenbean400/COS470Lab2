Those working legally in Japan 's sex industry will be able to access assistance in the government â€™s economic relief package , Health and Labor Minister Kazunobu Kato said in a news conference Tuesday . 
That 's a reversal of the government 's original plan , which excluded restaurants and bars in the adult entertainment industry . 
The government will provide a subsidy of 8,330 yen ( $ 76 ) per day to businesses that allow employees to take leave to care for children out of school . 
The government 's original plan was criticized as occupational discrimination by government opposition members .
