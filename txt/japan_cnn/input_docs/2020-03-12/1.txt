Panic buying has been rife amid the global spread of the coronavirus , with shoppers stockpiling goods like toilet paper , hand sanitizer and canned food . 
In Japan , those who could not buy toilet paper have resorted to pilfering supplies from public restrooms . 
But one Japanese store has cursed its toilet rolls to prevent thefts . 
Mink Itachibe , who works at a convenience store in Niigata prefecture , noticed people stealing between three to five rolls of toilet paper each day . 
She sketched an image that shows three eyes and several kanji characters and stuck it up in front of the toilet rolls . 
Some store owners use images of eyes to give the impression that they are watching out for potential thieves , Itachibe told CNN . 
The kanji below imply that if someone takes the toilet paper from the store , a hungry monster will hunt them down and gobble them up . 
Itachibe has reported no thefts of toilet paper from her store since she put up the sketches .
