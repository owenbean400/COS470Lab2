International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons is backing the decision to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Games until 2021 , saying it was " the only logical option . " 
After weeks of speculation and mounting criticism at the delay in announcing a postponement , International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed earlier today that the event would be rescheduled for " no later than summer 2021 . " 
The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games had been scheduled to take place from August 25 until September 6 . 
Now , the Paralympic Games will also be delayed , Parsons said . 
" Sport is not the most important thing right now , preserving human life is , " he added . 
" When the Paralympic Games do happen in Tokyo next year , they will be a spectacular global celebration of humanity coming together again as one . " 
The Olympics have never been rescheduled in peacetime . 
In 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , the Games were canceled because of World Wars .
