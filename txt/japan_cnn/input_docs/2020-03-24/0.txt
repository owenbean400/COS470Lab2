Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is going to hold a phone call with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach at 8 p.m . Tokyo time , Abe 's office said , as calls for both the IOC and Japanese government to postpone the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo grow louder . 
Abe and his ministers had previously resisted calls to either cancel or delay the Games , which are scheduled to start on July 24 . 
But as other major sports leagues and events worldwide canceled and postponed tournaments and games , pressure has mounted for the IOC to do the same for the quadrennial competition . 
Abe told lawmakers Monday that postponing the Games is a possibility , the first time he has publicly taken such a position . 
Japan and the IOC have faced calls to postpone the Games in recent days from several athletes and countries . 
The IOC said a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks , due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics .
