Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ordered a government task force be set up in response to the coronavirus pandemic , as the number of cases in the country spiked today . 
The establishment of a task force is a requirement to declaring a state of emergency -- though Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today that the country was not yet at the point of declaring one . 
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told media after the meeting that the government feared the number of new coronavirus cases was on the rise , with spikes in cases in big cities and from inbound travelers . 
Wednesday saw the highest single day jump in cases so far , with 98 new cases .
