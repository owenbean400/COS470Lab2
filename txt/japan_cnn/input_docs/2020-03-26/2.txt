Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike urged residents in the city to avoid making " non essential outings " this weekend as the city reported an increase in its number of novel coronavirus cases . 
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday , Koike said Tokyo is now at a " critical moment " to stop the infection rate from spiking . 
She asked event organizers to refrain from holding large gatherings and urged Tokyo residents to work from home as much as possible and avoid social meetings and crowded places until April 12 . 
Koike ’s latest remarks will be a test for the city of over 9 million people , which has been reluctant to impose a lockdown on its residents . 
While other countries have been quick to enforce restrictions on their citizens to contain the spread of the coronavirus , in Japan it ’s largely been business as usual . 
Remote working kicks in : Some Japanese companies have adopted the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and offices , but many still commute to work . 
Precautions urged : On March 19 , a central government expert panel called on organizers of large scale events to exercise caution , including canceling plans , to prevent the spread of the virus . 
But despite such warnings , over the weekend , many still ventured out to view the cherry blossoms in Tokyo ’s parks and public areas . 
Biggest single day jump : As of Wednesday evening local time , Tokyo reported 41 new cases of novel coronavirus , according to Koike . 
Japan reported 98 new cases and two more deaths on Wednesday , marking the country 's largest single day jump in new infections since the outbreak began .
