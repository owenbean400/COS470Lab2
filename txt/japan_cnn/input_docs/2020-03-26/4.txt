Yesterday , the governor of Tokyo held an emergency news conference urging citizens to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily . 
Today , it appears residents are ignoring the warnings . 
Streets around the Meguro River are packed with people gathering to view the blooming cherry blossoms . 
Some are wearing masks , but just as many people are not . 
It 's cherry blossom season -- meaning all week , people have been going to parks and public areas , picnicking outdoors , and gathering in large numbers . 
Authorities are urging citizens not to take the pandemic lightly -- Japan reported its largest single day jump in cases yesterday -- but their pleas for social distancing appear to have had little effect .
