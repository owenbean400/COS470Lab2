Japan â€™s foreign ministry issued a travel alert for the entire world on Wednesday for the first time as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates . 
The ministry raised its travel alert to level 2 on a four level scale , urging people in Japan to refrain from non essential overseas trips . 
The latest move is aimed at preventing the spread of the virus , as Japan has seen a rise in people testing positive after returning from overseas trips . 
Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi also warned that people traveling abroad may find their mobility restricted or be unable to find flights home if the country they visit issues a lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
Earlier this week , the foreign ministry also requested that those returning to Japan from the United States self quarantine for two weeks .
