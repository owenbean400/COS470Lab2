Jarring contradictions in the Trump administration 's response to the coronavirus are casting doubt on its capacity to tackle an outbreak . 
While President Donald Trump is reassuring the nation that the virus is " going to go away " and is " very well under control , " government experts are painting a far more dire picture . 
Warnings from experts : The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said the coronavirus was not recognized to be spreading inside the United States . 
But a top CDC expert warned the virus could bring severe disruption to American life , and told people to get ready now . 
The mayor of San Francisco declared a state of emergency to prepare for the possible arrival of the virus . 
And some questioned the government 's capacity to monitor outbreaks after it emerged that only 12 state and local health laboratories can test for the novel coronavirus . 
Cases in the US : To date , there are 57 recorded cases of coronavirus in the United States , including 40 passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan , three people who were brought home from China and 14 other patients .

But fast moving developments mean that Trump looks behind the curve of the growing threat to the United States -- a dangerous position for a President who is seeking a second term . 
Democrats , apparently looking for vulnerabilities , are warning that his administration is asleep as a possible pandemic builds .
