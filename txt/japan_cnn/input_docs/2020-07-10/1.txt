Australia â€™s Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) announced on Friday in a statement that it had granted provisional approval to remdesivir as the first treatment option for the novel coronavirus in Australia . 
The statement added that the drug " offers the potential to reduce the strain on Australia 's health care system . 
By reducing recovery times patients will be able to leave hospital earlier , freeing beds for those in need . " 
" While this is a major milestone in Australia 's struggle against the pandemic , it is important to emphasize that the product has not been shown to prevent coronavirus infection or relieve milder cases of infection , " TGA said . 
The statement continued : " Australia is one of the first regulators to authorize the use of Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID 19 , following on from recent approvals in European Union , Japan , and Singapore , " said the Administration adding that " international regulatory cooperation played a significant role , as the European Medicines Agency and the Singapore Health Sciences Authority generously shared their review reports with TGA at an early stage .
