The mayor of Japan 's third largest city is facing a public backlash after he said men would make more effective grocery shoppers than women as officials struggle to prevent overcrowding at stores amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
The number of confirmed cases of the virus has spiked in recent weeks -- dashing hopes that the government 's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread . 
As of Friday , Japan had recorded 13,100 confirmed cases , including 330 deaths , according to the country 's health ministry . 
On March 1 , Japan had reported just 243 cases . 
That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place nationwide . 
On Thursday , Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui implied male grocery shoppers would reduce the potential spread of the virus as they would spend less time in shops . 
Gender inequality : Women account for more than 51 % of the Japanese population , according to World Bank data . 
However , Japan is ranked 110th out of 149 countries in the World Economic Forum 's gender gap index . 
Journalist fires back : The mayor 's comments prompted journalist Shoko Egawa to post on Twitter that " people who know nothing about daily life should not make comments . " 
Egawa 's post gleaned over 3,000 retweets , with one social media user suggesting in a tweet that Matsui had probably never done the shopping himself . 
Another commentator tweeted that Japan 's tragedy was having politicians like Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso , who they said knew nothing about daily life . 
Limiting crowds at supermarkets : Osaka has been under a state of emergency since April 7 . 
Matsui 's comments came after he suggested supermarkets limit the number of people entering stores where possible , and recommended the public only shop for groceries once every two to three days .
