Shinzo Abe , the longest serving Japanese prime minister in history , has resigned , citing health reasons . 
Abe suffers from colitis , a non curable inflammatory bowel disease , which was also a factor in his sudden resignation as prime minister in 2007 , ending his first term after just over a year in office . 
On Monday morning , Abe visited Keio University Hospital in Tokyo for what was his second hospital visit in a week . 
" For almost eight years I controlled my chronic disease , however , this year in June I had a regular check up and there was a sign of the disease , " Abe said . 
" I made a judgment that I should not continue my job as prime minister " he said . 
" I need to fight against the disease and need to be treated . " 
Abe had been expected to hold a news conference on Friday to update on the coronavirus situation in Japan .
