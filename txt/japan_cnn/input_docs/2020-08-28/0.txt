Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe intends to resign due to health issues , according to Japan 's public broadcaster NHK , citing sources close to Abe . 
A government aide told CNN he heard that Abe has conveyed his desire to resign . 
Abe had been expected to hold a news conference later on Friday to update on the coronavirus situation in Japan . 
On Monday morning , Abe visited Keio University Hospital in Tokyo for what was his second hospital visit in a week . 
Abe suffers from colitis , a non curable inflammatory bowel disease , which forced him to resign during his first stint as the country 's leader from 2006 to 2007 . 
He became Prime Minister again in 2012 . 
Abe is Japan 's longest serving head of government in terms of consecutive days in office . 
Coronavirus criticism : Japan has recorded more than 66,000 Covid 19 cases , and has struggled to get the pandemic under control despite being among the very first countries to be hit by the virus . 
Throughout the summer , as the rest of East Asia has moved to control the pace of infections , Japan 's outbreak has spiked , with more than half of all cases being recorded since July . 
Many people have expressed dissatisfaction with the government 's handling of the virus , from a slow initial response and refusal to acknowledge the crisis , which many saw as linked to a desire to avoid canceling or postponing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics ( since pushed to next year ) , to the ongoing failure to take sufficient action to rein in cases . 
This is a developing story .
