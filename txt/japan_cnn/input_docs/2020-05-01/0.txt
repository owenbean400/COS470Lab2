The Tokyo metropolitan government is introducing robot staffers to hotels in the capital where coronavirus patients with mild symptoms are staying . 
One semi humanoid robot dubbed " Pepper " and another autonomous vacuum cleaner robot known as " Whiz " will be taking up their posts in five hotels in Japan 's capital . 
Both robots are made by Japanese firm Soft Bank Robotics . 
Since April 17 , the Tokyo metropolitan government has moved coronavirus patients with mild symptoms into select hotels in the capital to relieve pressure on hospitals . 
But checking into these hotels can be a lonesome experience as patients must register themselves , keep to their rooms , and only go down to the lobby three times a day to pick up their meals at designated time slots . 
Tsuji added that the lobby area had been designated as a " red zone " -- an area with a high risk of infection -- as coronavirus patients pass through it to pick up their daily meals . 
" Having robots there will improve the safety for the staff who have to work in that area , " added Tsuji . 
Helping staff : Each hotel is staffed by 15 to 20 city officials , plus one doctor and two to three nurses , who wear full protective gear when walking through the lobby , the corridors and when checking in on each patient . 
Greetings and reminders : Pepper is intended to cheer patients and boost morale . 
The robot reminds patients to check their temperature regularly and repeats phrases like " united in the fight against coronavirus . " 
Bringing in the robots : Tokyo officials want to expand the use of robots in hotels used to accommodate coronavirus patients and hope to deploy them on each floor .
