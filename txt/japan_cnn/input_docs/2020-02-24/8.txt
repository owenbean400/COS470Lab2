Japanese authorities are in contact with all 23 passengers who were released from the Diamond Princess cruise ship by mistake , the country 's health ministry told CNN , adding that at least three of those passengers have retested negative for the coronavirus . 
According to the ministry , the 23 passengers in question were required to have a second test because their initial test came before February 5 , when a ship wide quarantine was mandated . 
Passengers who were in close contact with an infected person after their first test were also required to have a second test and a reset 14 day quarantine since last contact before receiving certification to disembark . 
In terms of timing of the second test , the Japanese health ministry told CNN that there was no specific time window for those tests to take place , they just needed to be conducted during the passenger â€™s quarantine period .
