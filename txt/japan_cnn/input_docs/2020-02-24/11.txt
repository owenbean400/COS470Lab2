There are now 53 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday . 
These include 36 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship , three people repatriated from China and 14 US cases . 
This reflects an increase in 18 cases from Friday , all among Diamond Princess passengers . 
At the time , CDC officials said that there were additional passengers who had tested positive for the virus in Japan and would likely be added to the official US count once those test results had been adjudicated . 
The 14 US cases include eight in California , one in Massachusetts , one in Washington state , one in Arizona , two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin . 
Among these cases , there are two instances of person to person transmission , one in Illinois and one in California .
