The Japanese government is facing a public backlash after it promoted " new social behavior " guidelines on Monday , as a state of emergency implemented to curb the spread of coronavirus was extended until May 31 . 
Speaking at a news conference , an expert panel said the rate of new cases was on the decline in Japan -- but emergency measures would remain in place and the new guidelines should become the norm , as an uptick in infections would overwhelm hospitals . 
New normal : The panel stressed the need to permanently adopt measures such as wearing face masks outside , keeping 2 meters ( 6.5 ft ) between people , teleworking as much as possible , avoiding crowded spaces and washing hands regularly with soap in the long term fight against the virus . 
Backlash ensues : The advice , however , prompted criticism on social media . 
Many people commented that the new guidelines were obvious and that it was patronizing to try to enforce them . 
One new recommendation made on Monday for people eating in restaurants to sit outside , side by side while keeping conversation to a minimum , triggered the biggest adverse reaction . 
Others , however , preferred to err on the side of caution . 
One Twitter user posted images of people eating out alone and children at elementary schools eating lunch at their desks with a protective shield around each of them . 
On Tuesday , the Japanese government said it would reevaluate the need to maintain the state of emergency on a weekly basis , according to public broadcaster NHK .
