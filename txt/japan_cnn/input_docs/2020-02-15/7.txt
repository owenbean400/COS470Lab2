Passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship , which has been docked in quarantine in Japan since February 4 , will be disembarked over several days beginning February 21 , said the president fo the cruise operator . 
Crew on board will likely begin their own quarantine once all passengers have left the ship , said Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz in a letter read to passengers by the ship â€™s captain . 
This does not apply to the Americans taking the US Government evacuation charter flight on Sunday . 
Delay on testing : According to Swartz , the Japanese government said they may start a new testing process starting February 18 -- which may push back the disembarkment . 
The quarantine originally was set to lift on February 19 . 
" We understand there is a limit to the number of tests the Japanese government can complete each day , so testing all of our remaining guests could take a few days to complete , " Swartz said . 
Because each test takes several days to process results , the first guests would not disembark until February 21 . 
Extra quarantine for crew : Crew members were not quarantined from the start because " the Japanese government view the guests as more susceptible to the virus due to age , health profiles , among other factors . 
Therefore , guests were potentially at higher risk , for this reason a different quarantine protocol was implemented . " 
" It is disappointing for all of us , " Swartz said .
