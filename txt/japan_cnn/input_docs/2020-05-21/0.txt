In an interview with BBC Sport , International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said he understands why the Tokyo Olympics would need to be canceled if the Games cannot be held in the summer of 2021 . 
Bach said Japan â€™s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had made it clear to him that next summer was the " last option " for the Olympics in Japan . 
In April , Abe said it would be " impossible " to hold the Olympics unless the coronavirus pandemic was contained . 
" Quite frankly , I have some understanding for this , because you cannot forever employ 3,000 , or 5,000 , people in an organizing committee , " Bach told BBC Sport . 
In the interview , Bach also said reorganizing the Olympic games was a " mammoth task " and a scenario of holding the games behind closed doors remains as " speculation . "
