Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said he wo not approve a Covid 19 vaccine for the public until after the country ’s health surveillance agency ( ANVISA ) gives a second opinion . 
Speaking in his weekly Facebook live video on Thursday -- just hours after Brazil ’s health ministry announced the country had surpassed 4 million Covid 19 cases -- Bolsonaro said vaccines developed in the United States , the European Union , Japan and China , while " scientifically proven in these other countries , " would require further examination to be used for immunizations in Brazil . 
On Monday , Bolsonaro was recorded on cell phone video telling a supporter he would not make a Covid 19 vaccine mandatory in Brazil . 
Brazil ’s health ministry followed up Wednesday , confirming that no one would be forced to receive the vaccine . 
Bolsonaro repeated that pledge in Thursday ’s broadcast , drawing support from the country ’s anti vaxxer community .
