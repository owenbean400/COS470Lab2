Japan 's Health Ministry will likely not test all passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess for the Wuhan coronavirus due to " capacity " issues , a top official said . 
" After 14 days , if people have no symptoms , logically we can say these people are not infected by this virus , " Japan vice minister of health , labor and welfare , Gaku Hashimoto , told CNN in an exclusive interview on Monday . 
The Japanese health minister told reporters Monday that the government was considering testing all on board . 
However , a government official later in the day said it was not feasible . 
Japan has a limited number of testing kits and it appears the government is wary of using them all up . 
" They are spending time with a lot of anxiety every day in a small space , and 14 days is a long time in a circumstance like this . 
We need to take care of people who have pre existing conditions , and also people who are elderly . 
We are trying to be ready for testing people who have high risks first . "
