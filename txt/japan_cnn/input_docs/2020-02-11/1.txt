An official from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in Tokyo to assist the US Embassy with its support of Americans on board the Diamond Princess , CNN has learned . 
Passengers have been stuck on the cruise ship since February 4 , after reports emerged that one of its passengers was infected with the coronavirus that has swept through China . 
Since then , 135 people have been confirmed infected , including at least 24 Americans . 
" We believe the Japanese authorities and cruise lines are working hard to keep all passengers – and the public – safe , " a State Department official told CNN . 
" We ask passengers on board for their patience and understanding and to fully cooperate with and follow the instructions of global medical authorities and the Japanese government . " 
Over the weekend , the CDC sent a letter to Americans on board the Diamond Princess advising them of hygiene procedures . 
" Remaining in your room on the ship is the safest option to minimize your risk of infection , " the letter said . 
Consular officers are also visiting American cruise ship passengers who have been sent to hospitals in Tokyo .
