A viral video from Japan aims to show how easily germs and viruses can spread in restaurants when just one person is infected . 
The experiment simulates the atmosphere at a buffet restaurant or on a cruise ship . 
It was conducted by the public broadcasting organization NHK in conjunction with health experts . 
The video shows 10 people coming into the restaurant , with one singled out as the " infected " person . 
Each participant goes about the buffet as they normally would , not considering a potential contamination . 
At the end of the video , the participants are cast under black lights illuminating where the " infection " has spread . 
The substance , used to signify the germs , can be seen on food , serving utensils and platters , and even on the faces of some of the participants .
