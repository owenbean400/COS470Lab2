A large group of Americans who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were spotted boarding a chartered flight at the Haneda Airport in Tokyo . 
Nearly 400 Americans on board of the Diamond Princess were sent a notice Saturday laying out plans to evacuate them to the United States . 
They are among thousands of travelers who had been stuck in their cabins under mandatory quarantine since February 3 . 
Those who chose to take part in the US government â€™s voluntary evacuation arrived in 10 buses at the airport earlier today .
