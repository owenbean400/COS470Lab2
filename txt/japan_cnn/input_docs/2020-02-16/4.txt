A day after the US announced it would evacuate Americans from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan , the Canadian government is following suit , charting a plane to pull out its citizens . 
The plane will bring citizens to Canadian Forces Base Trenton , and then onward to NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall , Ontario where they will have to undergo another 14 day quarantine , just like the Americans . 
The statement did not give a timeline for the evacuation . 
CNN is making inquiries . 
" Before boarding in Japan , passengers will be screened for symptoms , " it said . 
" Those who exhibit symptoms of COVID 19 will not be permitted to board and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health system to receive appropriate care . "
