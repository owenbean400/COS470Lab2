The coronavirus pandemic is throwing doubt over whether this year 's Summer Olympics in Tokyo will still go ahead . 
Canada has become the first country to announce it wo not send athletes to the Games .

Who would be impacted by this ? 
Doing so would have ramifications on everything and everyone from the sponsors and broadcasters to the economy and athletes . 
Organizers said in December that the cost of hosting the Olympics was 1.35 trillion yen ( $ 12.25 billion ) -- and , according to Reuters , that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat , a decision taken in October 2019 .
