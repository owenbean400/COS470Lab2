Japan 's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has expressed " remorse " for attending a group dinner with celebrity friends while encouraging people to dine out in small numbers to curb the spread of Covid 19 . 
Suga attended a gathering of seven guests who were all over the age of 70 at a high end steak restaurant on Monday . 
Tokyo 's metropolitan government has asked that the number of people dining in restaurants be limited to five and has urged senior citizens to adhere to this guidance . 
" We have been taking precautions , but the number of infections remains at a high level with 3,000 new infections confirmed in the last weekend . 
We are taking this very seriously . 
Experts pointed out that group dining has higher risks , " a spokesperson from the Tokyo metropolitan government said .
