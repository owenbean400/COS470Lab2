Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing a public backlash after he said the government would distribute two reusable cloth face masks per household amid growing concern over medical shortages , as the country faces a worsening coronavirus outbreak . 
The number of confirmed cases of the virus has spiked in recent weeks , after it appeared that Japan 's initial response had got the virus relatively under control . 
As of Wednesday , there were more than 2,300 cases across Japan , and 57 deaths , according to a Johns Hopkins University tally . 
That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place in Tokyo and other major cities , and a run on protective gear , including face masks . 
On Wednesday , Abe said the provision of cloth masks to the worst hit areas " will be helpful in responding to the rapidly increasing demand . " 
But Abe 's proposal to send two masks to each household attracted outrage and mockery online Wednesday , with the hashtag " Abe 's mask " and " screw your two masks " trending on Twitter . 
Many felt the move was lackluster and would not go into effect fast enough to have a chance at curbing the spread of the virus , with masks not due to be distributed until the end of the month . 
Others dubbed the policy " Abenomask policy " as satirical memes showing well known cartoon characters sharing one mask between four family members popped up online . 
The anger comes as Abe resisted calls Wednesday to declare a state of emergency , saying that use of such powers was not imminent .
