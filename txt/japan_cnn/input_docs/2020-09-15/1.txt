Two passengers on separate flights were forced to disembark from planes in Japan this month after refusing to wear masks while on board . 
One incident occurred Saturday and involved a Hokkaido Air System Company flight from Hakodate to the island of Okushiri , both of which are located in the northern province of Hokkaido . 
One man who was not wearing a mask was ordered off the plane by the captain , according to Matsuhiro Ohta , a public relations official with Hokkaido Air System Company , which is a subsidiary of Japan Airlines , delaying the flight by a half hour . 
Ohta said that it appeared the issue stemmed from miscommunication -- the passenger claimed after he was forced off the flight that he was developing a rash while wearing the mask . 
However , Ohta said the passenger was unruly and uncooperative and that his refusal to wear a mask was only part of the reason he was not allowed to fly . 
The other incident occurred on September 7 . 
A Peach Aviation flight from the city of Kushiro in Japan 's north to Osaka was forced to make what the airline called an " unscheduled stop " after a passenger refused to put on a mask despite repeated requests from flight attendants . 
The company told CNN that it is not ruling out taking legal action against the passenger . 
Ultimately , the flight made its way to Osaka after a delay of two hours and 15 minutes .
