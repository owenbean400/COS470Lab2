Japan has " some suspicions " about Kim Jong Un ’s health , the country 's Defense Minister said at a press briefing on Thursday . 
Kono added that the " strange movements " were due to Kim " trying not to get infected , " by coronavirus , as the disease " is spreading around " North Korea . 
The minister said Japan , the US , and others have been exchanging information on North Korea . 
When asked to elaborate on Kim 's health he added : " I ’m not allowed to discuss intelligence issues . " 
Kono also said that Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has tabled the idea of acquiring weapons that would let the country strike at enemy missile bases to counter missile threats . 
The Defense Minister said that Japan would still look at options to counter any North Korea ’s ballistic missiles after Tokyo scrapped the US built Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System .
