Scientists at Imperial College London estimate that around 4,000 people are likely to have been infected by the Wuhan coronavirus in Wuhan city alone as of January 18 . 
Official numbers show 17 people have died and more than 500 people have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus within the Chinese mainland , but a team at Imperial believes these numbers are a gross underestimate . 
Mild symptoms and delayed onset mean many cases are likely to have been undetected . 
The new estimates are more than double previous estimates the scientists released last week , which suggested 1,723 people were likely to have been infected by January 12 . 
The revision takes into account new information available this week , such as reports of exported cases in Thailand , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan and the United States . 
Wuhan is still the epicenter of the outbreak , explained Neil Ferguson , professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London , highlighting that the majority of cases continue to be reported in this region . 
Estimates are likely to change as more information becomes available , such as a newly reported case in Macao .
