On the streets of Japan 's capital , there 's no sense of panic or alarm , but people are steadily increasing their precautions against the deadly novel coronavirus that is spreading globally . 
Seven new cases of the novel coronavirus in Japan were announced Tuesday , bringing the country 's total to 68 outside of the 545 infections linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama . 
In Tokyo , people can regularly be seen wearing surgical face masks , despite a shortage of the protective wear making them increasingly hard to find . 
Many convenience stores and supermarkets are limiting the purchase of face masks to one packet per person . 
Some shops have also posted signs saying when the next mask delivery will be to avoid having to constantly respond to customer queries . 
No panic : But unlike other countries , there has been no sign of panic buying of supplies such as toilet paper or canned food in Japan . 
Japanese companies are increasingly recommending people work from home if possible , as alcohol hand wash has appeared in lifts and corridors of major buildings across Tokyo . 
Speaking on Tuesday , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged citizens who had cold like symptoms to stay at home . 
But there 's no doubt that tensions are steadily increasing in the country as health experts warn Japan has entered the " next phase " of the outbreak spreading locally in the country . 
For now , Japan is on alert , not alarmed .
