Tokyo Gov . 
Yuriko Koike is asking residents of the prefecture to refrain from going outdoors unless necessary this weekend in order to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus . 
Japan reported 235 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Friday morning , bringing the total number of recorded cases in the country to 3,329 . 
The capital Tokyo saw its largest single day rise yet of 97 cases . 
There are now 684 infections in the city . 
Koike warned that the situation in the Japanese megacity is worsening and could be on the verge of a massive outbreak . 
Following the spike in infections in Tokyo and other cities , Japan is scrambling to avert an explosive uptick in cases as public pressure mounts on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency . 
Such a move would allow prefectural governors to send out a stronger message when it comes to urging the public to stay at home , but the measures will not be legally binding . 
Supermarkets , pharmacies , banks and the Tokyo Stock Exchange will remain open even in the event of a state of emergency . 
Publicly funded high schools in Tokyo will remain closed until May 6 , but some schools will reopen as scheduled next week . 
Museums , zoos and other venues run by the city will remain closed until the end of Golden Week , a nationwide national holiday that runs until May 6 . 
Koike also asked citizens again to stay away from nightclubs and other nightspots . 
Koike said she will repeat her request if the Abe government declares a state of emergency .
