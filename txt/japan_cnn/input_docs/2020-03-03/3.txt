A request by the US city of San Antonio for a restraining order to keep Diamond Princess cruise ship evacuees in quarantine has been denied by a federal judge . 
The evacuees are currently being held at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas . 
According to Rodriguez , the evacuees had successfully passed two coronavirus tests , 24 hours apart , and had been in quarantine for two weeks . 
" This court has no authority to second guess those determinations even though the court also shares the concerns expressed by the plaintiffs , " the judge said . 
Over 700 cases of the novel coronavirus have been linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship , which was quarantined in Yokohama , Japan for two weeks in February . 
CNN spoke to evacuees at the Lackland Air Force Base , who were frustrated by the delay in letting them out of quarantine .
