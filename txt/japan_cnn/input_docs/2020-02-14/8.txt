Four more people in Japan -- not from the Diamond Princess cruise ship -- have tested positive for novel coronavirus , the Ministry of Health , Labor , and Welfare said on Friday . 
That brings the total in Japan to 254 , of which : 219 cases are from the Diamond Princess , including one quarantine officer 35 cases have occurred on land One woman aged in her 80s has died from the virus The latest cases on land include a woman in her 60s who is a taxi driver in Okinawa . 
She had given rides to passengers from the Diamond Princess during its stop at the island on February 1 , prior to the quarantine . 
Two other new cases are people from Tokyo who had close contact with a taxi driver who has previously been confirmed to have the virus . 
The fourth person is a man in his 70s who was treated at the same hospital where a doctor tested positive for the virus on Thursday . 
That man , in turn , a surgeon in his 50s , was the first doctor to have been confirmed to have the virus ; his case was announced on Thursday . 
The local government suspects that the hospital connection may be coincidental , because the man whose case was announced today developed symptoms before visiting the hospital on February 6 .
