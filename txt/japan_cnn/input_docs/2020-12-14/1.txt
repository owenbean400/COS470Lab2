The Go To scheme offers travelers up to 50 % discounts on transportation , hotels , restaurants , tourist attractions and shopping , in an effort to encourage domestic travel during the pandemic downturn . 
Suga said discouraging travel would help curb a current spike in cases . 
He also announced a $ 11,500 per month support payment for hospitality businesses , to help owners comply with a shortening of trading hours . 
Doctors and nurses treating serious Covid 19 patients will receive a bonus payment of $ 50 per hour .
