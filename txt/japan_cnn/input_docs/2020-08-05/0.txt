Japan recorded 1,240 new coronavirus cases and six virus related deaths on Tuesday , as the country grapples with a recent spike in infections . 
Tuesday 's figures raise the national total to 41,841 cases and 1,035 deaths . 
Of Tuesday 's new cases , abut a quarter came from the country 's capital , Tokyo . 
This is the eighth straight day that Tokyo has recorded more than 200 new daily cases . 
Two thirds of the city 's Tuesday cases are untraceable , meaning authorities were unable to find out the source of infection , said the metropolitan government . 
Other major cities like Osaka also saw high numbers of new cases , raising concerns among local politicians . 
The governor of Kanagawa prefecture , which neighbors Tokyo , said he expected the rise in Tokyo cases to also spread into his prefecture . 
A spike in cases : For months , Japan seemed to have the virus largely under control . 
Throughout most of May and June , daily case numbers hovered around several dozen , ranging from around 20 to 60 a day . 
But case numbers passed 100 on June 30 , and have only continued rising since then , jumping by hundreds in a matter of weeks .
