When the Diamond Princess cruise ship went into quarantine in Yokohama , Japan , it had 428 US citizens on board . 
At least 13 of them have already been confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus , which has spread quickly through the ship . 
In total , 70 passengers have the virus . 
US author Gay Courter , who is on board the ship , told CNN that she was desperate to get off but was being blocked by US and Japanese authorities , despite her insurance provider agreeing to evacuate her . 
" I ( just ) do not want to go home in a box , " she said . 
The US embassy in Tokyo today issued a message to all the Americans on board the Diamond Princess , reassuring them that their " welfare and safety " was their top priority . 
" The safest option to minimize the risk of infection is to remain in your cabin on the ship , as passengers on the Diamond Princess are doing , " the letter said , adding that after their quarantine was over there would be no further protective measures when they returned to the US . 
The embassy added that if anyone on board was running low on medication they needed to let the ship 's medical center know as soon as possible . 
" The US Embassy and the Department of State continue to closely monitor the situation , " the statement said .
