Princess Cruises will offer a full refund for passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined at Yokohama , Japan , a representative told CNN . 
The ship has been quarantined at the port since February 4 after a former passenger tested positive for coronavirus . 
Since then , 70 news cases of the virus have been confirmed aboard the ship . 
There are more than 3,700 people on board the cruise ship , including 2,600 passengers . 
In a letter , Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz thanked passengers for their " perseverance and understanding . " 
Swartz said the company will " refund reasonable independent expenses , " along with air travel , transfers or pre/post cruise hotels . 
Each guest also will receive a 100 % future cruise credit equal to the fare passengers paid for the quarantined voyage , Swartz wrote . 
That credit has to be applied by February 28 , 2021 . 
" It is our sincere hope that the refund and credit will help ease at least a small bit of the stress you may be feeling right now , " Swartz wrote .
