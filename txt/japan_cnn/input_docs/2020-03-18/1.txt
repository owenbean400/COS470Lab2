Dissent is growing among leading athletes as they voice concerns about preparing for the Olympics amid the novel coronavirus outbreak after organizers encouraged them to continue preparation as planned . 
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) said Tuesday that no " drastic decisions " will be made about the Games , which get underway in Tokyo in July , and that measures are being taken to guarantee the " safety and interests of athletes , coaches and support teams . " 
But athletes believe they have been forced into an impossible position given the virus , which has infected more that 198,000 people worldwide and killed at least 7,900 . 
In a statement to CNN , the IOC said : " This is an exceptional situation which requires exceptional solutions . " 
" The IOC is committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes , while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes â€™ health . " 
On Tuesday , the UK 's world heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson Thompson expressed her frustration at the situation . 
In a statement posted on social media she said : " The IOC and the Local Government are at odds with one another . " 
" The IOC advice ' encourages athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympics Games as best as they can ' with the Olympics only four months away but the government legislation is enforcing isolation at home , with tracks , gyms and public spaces closed . "
