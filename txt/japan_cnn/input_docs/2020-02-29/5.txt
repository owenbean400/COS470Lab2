Japan â€™s Ministry of Health updated its numbers of novel coronavirus Friday to a total of 935 cases -- up on an earlier count of 907 cases . 
At least 11 people have died from the virus in the country , according to Japanese health officials . 
Of the 935 cases , 705 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama . 
The American owned cruise ship was put under quarantine by Japanese authorities for two weeks in February after a coronavirus outbreak was detected on board . 
Six people from the ship have died from coronavirus . 
Last week , a top Japanese government adviser admitted that the quarantine measures enacted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship may have allowed additional infections to spread among the ship 's crew and passengers . 
But by failing to isolate the crew of the Diamond Princess from the beginning of the quarantine , infected workers may have passed on " secondary or tertiary " infections to their fellow crew members and passengers , thereby exacerbating the deadly outbreak , according to Dr . Norio Ohmagari , the director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center at the government funded National Center for Global Health and Medicine .
