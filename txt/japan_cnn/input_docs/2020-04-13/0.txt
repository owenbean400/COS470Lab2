Soft Bank Group CEO Masayoshi Son says he has reached a deal to supply 300 million face masks a month for Japan , his home country . 
Son announced the deal on Twitter over the weekend , saying that he had partnered with Chinese automaker BYD to dedicate a factory line exclusively for Soft Bank . 
Some 100 million of the masks produced each month will be N95s , while the remaining 200 million will be general surgical masks , he added . 
Son said he would distribute the masks in consultation with the government starting in May , working first to supply medical institutions before handing them out to the general public . 
Japan 's government has dramatically stepped up mask production after a shortage in the country led to widespread criticism . 
Last week , when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency over the pandemic , he also said that the government would start targeting domestic production of 700 million disposable masks per month . 
Authorities are now working to distribute two masks to each household in a new initiative slated to kick off this week . 
Son has criticized the government over its response to the outbreak , asking why a politician is leading the country 's efforts instead of doctors .
