An area of the arrival hall at Tokyo 's Narita airport has been transformed into a cardboard box zone for international travelers who ca not find a space in a nearby government mandated hotel as they await their coronavirus test results . 
The makeshift waiting area with dozens of cardboard bed boxes is for those whose friends and relatives ca not pick them up immediately in a private car . 
Staff wearing protective gear provide snacks and water as travelers kill time . 
In Japan , sturdy cardboard box beds are normally used during disasters . 
But the use of this space in Narita airport has drawn criticism on Japanese social media , with users commenting that the area could promote the spread of coronavirus rather than contain it . 
" They do not do much testing in Japan , but many returnees from overseas are infected , " tweeted Misachasu , who also wrote a post on the experience of his Vietnamese friend who spent a night in the cardboard box zone . 
" We consider this space a high risk of infection . " 
Japan has enacted a ban on travelers from over 70 countries and regions , with no scheduled end date .
