Janese authorities are preparing emergency housing for thousands of " internet cafe refugees " as coronavirus infections spike across the country . 
Open around the clock : Internet cafes , which face temporary closure under Japan 's state of emergency declaration , have become a de facto home for those without access to stable housing . 
Many internet and manga cafes across Japan are open 24 hours a day and feature showers , coin laundries , a cafe with food and most importantly -- private booths that can be rented on an hourly or daily rate . 
Mostly men : There are more than 4,000 internet cafe refugees in Tokyo , according to a 2018 survey conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan government . 
Nearly 86 % of " residents " are men and just over 14 % are women . 
Roughly 15,000 people stay at such cafes daily during the week and some 4,000 of them are homeless . 
About 3,000 do not have stable jobs , according to the survey . 
Hatanaka Kazuo , a spokesperson for the metropolitan government , told CNN that rooms would be available in business hotels in the capital for those who applied . 
A total of 175 people have moved into hotel rooms as of April 10 . 
The rooms will be available until May 6 , when the country 's state of emergency is scheduled to end .
