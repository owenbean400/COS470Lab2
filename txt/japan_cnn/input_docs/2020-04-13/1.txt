Japanese social media users have accused Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of being tone deaf after he posted a video of himself relaxing at home as people across the country struggle to work from home . 
During the pandemic , many multinational companies have turned to messaging and video conferencing software such as Slack and Webex to keep in touch with colleagues . 
But in Japan , about 80 % of companies do not have the ability to let their employees work remotely , according to 2019 government data . 
Posted on Twitter , the video shows Abe reading a book , sipping a hot drink and relaxing with his pet dog as a musician serenades him online from another location . 
State of emergency : Abe â€™s tweet urging people to stay at home comes as large parts of Japan entered a first weekend under a state of emergency . 
Earlier in April , Abe faced public backlash after he said the government would distribute two reusable cloth face masks to roughly 50 million households amid growing concern over medical shortages . 
Cases spike : The number of confirmed cases has spiked in recent days , after it appeared that Japan 's initial response had brought the virus relatively under control . 
As of Monday , at least 7,967 cases have been reported across the country , including 712 cases linked to the Diamond Princess Cruise ship , according to Japan 's health ministry .
