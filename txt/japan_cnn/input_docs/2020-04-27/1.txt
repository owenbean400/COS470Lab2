The Bank of Japan expects the country ’s economy to contract by 3 % to 5 % this year -- a sharp departure from its forecast at the start of the year , which predicted slight growth . 
While it said Japan ’s economy is likely to improve as the outbreak wanes , the central bank added that " future developments are extremely unclear . " 
Officials had earlier predicted growth between 0.8 % and 1.1 % for 2020 . 
The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady Monday at its policy meeting , which usually lasts two days but was shortened to just half a day this month . 
But it did announce more easing measures as it tries to offset economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and address corporate funding strains . 
The central bank said it would now buy an unlimited amount of government bonds , scrapping an annual cap of 80 trillion yen ( $ 745 billion ) . 
The move was largely symbolic , since the central bank has in recent years been buying about a quarter of that amount annually , so it had a lot of room to increase its purchases even without removing the cap . 
However , Monday ’s announcement sends the message that Japan will do whatever it takes to shore up its economy . 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already committed roughly $ 1.1 trillion to protecting the country from virus related fallout . 
Japan ’s economy had been flirting with recession even before the outbreak . 
The world ’s third largest economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2019 as it absorbed a sales tax hike and grappled with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis , a powerful storm that hit the country last fall . 
Japan will report first quarter GDP next month .
