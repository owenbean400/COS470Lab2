A Japanese economics professor has estimated Japan could lose up to $ 36 billion as it fights to contain the fallout triggered from the coronavirus outbreak and the postponement of the Olympics . 
Those astronomical costs include cancellation maintenance fees for more than three dozen Olympic venues , compensation for thousands who have already purchased condos in the Olympic athletes village , and billions in broadcasting rights and pre paid advertising , according to Sayuri Shirashi , an economics professor at Keio University . 
Logistical nightmare : " The damage is quite big , " Shirashi told CNN . 
" If we do it next year , we do not know how successful this 2020 Olympics will be . " 
Japanese authorities this week announced the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to next year due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Now organizing bodies face the mammoth task of resolving scheduling conflicts with other major sporting events and rescheduling Olympic qualifiers . 
Unprecedented move : The Olympics have never been rescheduled in peacetime . 
In 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , the Games were canceled because of world wars .
