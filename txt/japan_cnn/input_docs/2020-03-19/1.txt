The Emperor and Empress of Japan have postponed a state visit to the UK that was planned for spring due to the coronavirus pandemic , according to a statement from Buckingham Palace . 
The visit will be rescheduled for a later date . 
Earlier in February , the Japanese Imperial Household canceled public birthday celebrations for Emperor Naruhito over fears that large crowds could allow the coronavirus to spread . 
It would have been the first public celebration of Emperor Naruhito â€™s birthday ; he took the throne last year after his father , Akihito , became the first emperor to abdicate in 200 years .
