Japanese Olympic Committee ( JOC ) board member Kaori Yamaguchi has called for the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed because athletes are unable to prepare adequately as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , she told the Nikkei newspaper . 
Yamaguchi , who won a Judo bronze medal at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988 , said she plans to raise this point at a JOC Board Meeting scheduled for March 27 . 
" The Olympics should not be held in a situation people in the world ca not enjoy , " Yamaguchi said . 
Some context : Yamaguchi ’s comments come after International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) member Hayley Wickenheiser on Tuesday called the decision to proceed with the Games " insensitive and irresponsible . " 
Wickenheiser , who competed for Canada in five Winter Olympic Games in Ice Hockey and at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Softball , wrote in a statement on Twitter : " This crisis is bigger than even the Olympics […] Athletes ca not train . 
Attendees ca not travel plan . " 
The IOC and Tokyo 2020 Organizers have repeatedly insisted that the games will run as scheduled in Japan ’s capital from July 24 to Aug . 9 .
