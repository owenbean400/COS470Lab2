The Tokyo Marathon is usually one of Japan 's biggest sporting events of the year , attracting up to 35,000 participants and 10,000 volunteers . 
However this year , there were just 300 elite runners allowed , and about 600 volunteers , as coronavirus fears swept through the region . 
After a number of virus cases were recorded in Tokyo , organizers said in February that they could not " launch the event within the scale we originally anticipated . " 
At the marathon today , roads were cordoned off as normal , with traffic cones in place to direct runners along the route . 
But that 's where the veneer of normalcy ended . 
The streets were empty and quiet , devoid of the cheering crowds that would typically pack the sidewalks . 
The few runners that passed by were applauded only by a handful of people on the sidelines . 
The marathon 's typical festive , energetic atmosphere was nowhere to be found .
