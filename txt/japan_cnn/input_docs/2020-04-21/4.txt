Japan has refuted a statement by the International Olympic Committee that it will share the costs of delaying the 2020 Olympic Games . 
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday , Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan had not reached an agreement with the IOC on addressing the additional costs resulting from the delay , and that discussions were ongoing . 
Earlier , the IOC had published a statement on its website saying that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had agreed to shoulder the costs of delaying the Olympics under existing agreements . 
Abe and IOC president Thomas Bach agreed on March 24 to postpone the Olympics until 2021 following weeks of mounting pressure to delay the Games amid the coronavirus pandemic .
