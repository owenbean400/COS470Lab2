Japan could " simplify " the Olympics and Paralympics Games , which were pushed back to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic , Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said Thursday . 
Koike did not give details on the alterations that could be made , though local media speculated it could involve the presence of spectators . 
" We need the understanding of the people of Tokyo and Japan to host the Olympic and Paralympic games . 
For that , we should rationalize what needs to be rationalized and simplify what needs to be simplified , " Koike told reporters . 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in March , when the 2020 Games were postponed , that Japan would hold the Olympic and Paralympic Games in " complete forms . " 
The International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organization Committee have been discussing the exact implementation of the postponed event . 
The cost of postponement is expected to be several billions of dollars , and the focal point of the discussion has been around how the cost will be paid and who will bear the financial burden .
