The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and Tokyo 2020 organizers have said they will explore all opportunities to reduce the cost of the summer games following its postponement until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday via videolink , John Coates – who heads up the IOC Coordination Commission for Tokyo 2020 – said the postponement provided an opportunity to assess " what are the must haves and what are the nice to haves . " 
Coates also praised Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for taking the decision to postpone the Games and said he believed Abe hoped it would lead to an economic stimulus in the country . 
" These Games can be how you kick start the economy again […] PM Abe is a very , very smart man . 
When he put it to the IOC to postpone , he had in mind the positive economic stimulus that it would provide for Japan . 
There will be a lot of cities and countries around the world wishing for a similar opportunity , " he added . 
When asked by journalists about the extra costs associated with the postponement of the games , Coates confirmed that the IOC would pick up those costs and vowed to protect the various stakeholders involved in the Olympic movement . 
" The IOC is certainly facing some very significant costs related to the Olympic movements . 
There are additional costs to our stakeholders . 
We will be bearing those costs of the Olympic movement , " Coates said . 
A new road map for planning for next year ’s Games is due to be established by May 2020 .
