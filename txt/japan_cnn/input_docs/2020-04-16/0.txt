Japan has recorded 488 new coronavirus infections and 17 additional deaths , the country 's health ministry said Thursday . 
That brings the country 's total number of reported infections to 9,294 , including 712 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship . 
The total death toll is 148 , including 12 from the cruise ship . 
The background : Much of Japan entered a state of emergency last week , after initially appearing to have the outbreak under control . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has faced criticism for not activating emergency measures earlier , as experts warned the true number of cases could be far higher than the official statistics suggest , due to a lack of widespread testing . 
Abe has also been accused of being tone deaf after he posted a video of himself relaxing at home as people across the country struggle to work from home .
