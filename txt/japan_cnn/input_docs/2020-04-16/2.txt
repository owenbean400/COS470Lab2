Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has declared that Japan 's state of emergency will be extended nationwide through May 6 in further attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus infections . 
The state of emergency previously applied to seven urban prefectures , including Tokyo . 
Abe said his decision comes after seeing the rapid hike of infections outside these areas . 
Abe wants to minimize the human flow during the golden week , a string of national holidays from the end of April through May 6 . 
He also announced he was considering cash handouts of 100,000 yen ( approximately $ 925 ) for each citizen , instead of the previous plan of 300,000 yen ( approximately $ 2,800 ) per low income family . 
Some context : On Wednesday , public broadcaster NHK reported that a team of experts set up by Japan â€™s Health Ministry estimated more than 400,000 people could die of Covid 19 in Japan if nothing is done to contain the virus . 
According to a tally from Johns Hopkins University , Japan has 8,626 reported cases of Covid 19 and 178 deaths .
