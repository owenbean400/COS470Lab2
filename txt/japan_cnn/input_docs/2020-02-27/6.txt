There are no plans to cancel the Olympic torch relay , which will see the iconic torch carried across Japan to the final destination of Tokyo , where the 2020 Games will be held , said the CEO of the organizing committee . 
The torch relay will begin March 26 . 
Toshiro Muto , the committee CEO , said the committee was working on how to host the event without increasing the risk of coronavirus infection , and was looking into suggestions of scaling down events and reducing the number of spectators for the relay . 
The organizing committee held a rehearsal for the relay on February 20 . 
Preparations for the Olympic Games are also continuing as planned , despite rumors that they may be cancelled , organizers told CNN yesterday . 
Japan 's Olympic Museum , which has been constructed next to the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo , has been closed until March 16 following the government issuing new guidance to prevent the spread of the virus .
