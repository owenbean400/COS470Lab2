There are " ongoing " conversations at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about expanding airport health screenings for coronavirus , according to an agency spokesperson . 
Right now , the US is only doing health screenings for passengers arriving from China . 
Those screenings involve a temperature check and observations for symptoms . 
But new outbreaks in other parts of the world are raising alarm . 
Spike in cases globally : When the screenings started on January 17 , there were 45 reported cases of the new coronavirus in China . 
Japan currently has about three times that number of cases , Italy has about 10 times as many , and South Korea has more than 30 times as many . 
At a news conference Wednesday night , President Donald Trump said there could be travel restrictions placed on passengers from other countries , such as South Korea and Italy . 
" At a right time we might do that . 
Right now it 's not the right time . 
But at a right time , " Trump said . 
What the checks do : In the US , temperature and symptom checks have not caught a single coronavirus case . 
However , another part of the screenings has worked better : At least two passengers read the information cards handed out during the screenings and sought medical care when they developed symptoms listed on the cards .
