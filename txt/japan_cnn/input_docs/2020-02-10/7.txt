The Westerdam cruise ship -- which has more than 2,000 people on board -- will dock this Thursday in the Thai city of Laem Chabang . 
It was previously denied entry to Japan , the Philippines and Taiwan as countries closed their ports to cruise ships over coronavirus fears . 
The vessel , operated by Holland America , was scheduled to end its itinerary in Yokohama , Japan , on February 15 , but was refused entry at any Japanese port despite having no confirmed cases of the coronavirus on board . 
Holland America says the guests will receive a 100 % refund for the current trip as well as " 100 % Future Cruise Credit . " 
Passengers will be allowed to disembark the ship at Laem Chabang , which is around 50 miles from Bangkok .
