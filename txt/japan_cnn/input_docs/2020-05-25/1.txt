Japan is set to expand its travel ban list to 111 countries effective Wednesday , now including the United States , India , and South Africa , the government ministries said . 
The ban list , which will add 11 more countries this week , forbids foreign nationals who stayed in those countries from entering Japan , to protect against the spread of coronavirus . 
Japanese citizens are still allowed to enter the country , although they will need to go through medical tests and self quarantine for 14 days . 
The travel ban expansion comes after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the country â€™s nationwide state of emergency earlier today . 
It lasted almost a month .
