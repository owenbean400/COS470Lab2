Chef José Andrés , whose World Central Kitchen fed those aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan , spoke at CNN 's ongoing town hall about what it was like on board . 
" If you are in a place , a hotel , a cruise ship , where everybody may be infected , it 's logical to say that you want to make sure in this case food is prepared outside , " Andrés said . 
Here 's how they got it done : First , they cooked meals outside the ship in an onshore location . 
" We got a lot of help from different Japanese chefs , " Andrés said . 
Then , they brought the food to kitchens near the ship . 
" We will reheat the food and put it back and bring it in with a forklift . 
And then inside , they will take care of distribution , " he said . 
" Everything was done , I would say , in a very professional way to make sure that everybody will be safe , achieving what we wanted , feed everybody in a healthy way , " Andrés added . 
This is not the first time Andrés has cooked in disaster scenarios : He also helped cook meals for those affected in the Bahamas during Hurricane Dorian , as well as Americans after as Hurricane Maria , Hurricane Florence , and the California wildfires .
