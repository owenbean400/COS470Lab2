Concerns are growing in Japan that the number of coronavirus cases could be higher than reported , with experts questioning the country 's approach to testing as infection rates continue to climb . 
Japan has officially recorded 1,045 cases and 12 deaths from the virus , with 696 of those cases liked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Yokohama Bay last month . 
Although the Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day , only 8,111 tests had been conducted as of March 4 , according to the country 's Health Ministry . 
Numbers are likely higher : Japan 's coronavirus figures are likely already much higher than reported , with the infection rate suspected to be just the " tip of the iceberg , " according to Masahiro Kami , the executive director of Japan 's Medical Governance Research Institute , a non profit group . 
Kami says for every one patient tested , there are many more who remain undiagnosed . 
But as most of these people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms they do not go to a clinic to get checked out . 
Japan under pressure : The country has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak -- specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess . 
Critics have also accused Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of prioritizing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and bilateral ties over national security , particularly as Japan did not shut down its borders during the early stages of the outbreak .
