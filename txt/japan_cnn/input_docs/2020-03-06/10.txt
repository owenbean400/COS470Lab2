South Korea â€™s government has suspended all visas as well as the visa waiver program for Japanese visitors , in a direct response to quarantine measures imposed by Japan on travelers from South Korea . 
Cho Sei young , a vice minister in Seoul 's foreign ministry , said in an announcement on Friday that new visas will require a health survey and could require documentation depending on how the situation develops . 
South Korea said these measures were being made to " control infectious diseases from Japan with an efficient quarantine system based on our advanced and excellent quarantine systems . " 
The notice added that a special immigration process would be implemented from Monday for other foreign nationals arriving from Japan , though it did not specify what that would mean .
