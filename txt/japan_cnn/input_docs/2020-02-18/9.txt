Nebraska 's largest medical facility has treated Ebola , SARS , monkeypox , and multidrug resistant tuberculosis . 
On Monday it was the novel coronavirus that kept the personnel at the Nebraska Medicine/University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha up overnight . 
That 's when the US Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness Response asked UNMC to take in a total of 13 patients who had either tested positive , or had a high likelihood of testing positive , for the novel coronavirus . 
The patients had been on a cruise ship docked off the cost of Japan for two weeks . 
The center said it was prepared . 
The facility : The special 10 bed biocontainment unit is a state of the art facility that has been doing this kind of complicated work for nearly 15 years . 
It is a secured area with its own ventilation system that is isolated from the rest of the hospital and is staffed by people with specialized training in communicable diseases . 
The quarantine center : UNMC has a federal quarantine center on its campus . 
That 's where 12 other patients from the cruise ship were sent Monday . 
The facility has 20 purpose built rooms , that are separate from , but are in close proximity to the biocontainment unit , that can be used if the patients need additional care . 
It was set up to care for patients who may not have symptoms , but who are at a high risk of exposure , or for patients who currently have mild symptoms or a positive test for a disease , but are not sick enough to require hospital admission . 
The 12 patients in the quarantine center will be tested on site for the novel coronavirus .
