Kyoto is usually packed with tourists from all over the world . 
But as the coronavirus outbreak keeps visitors away from the historic streets of Japan 's former capital , a group of shopkeepers have launched an " empty tourism " campaign to lure them back . 
Merchants from five shopping streets in Kyoto 's Arashiyama neighborhood -- a popular tourist district on the western outskirts of the city that 's filled with temples and shrines -- have devised an advertising campaign dubbed " suitemasu Arashiyama . " 
It translates to " empty Arashiyama " or " there are few people around in Arashiyama . " 
The posters created for the campaign showcase how any would be travelers could have the district 's most visited spots all to themselves . 
One poster shows a monkey with the caption : " It 's been a while since there were more monkeys than humans . " 
Underneath , there 's a photo of Togetsukyo Bridge -- normally crowded with Instagrammers -- with no tourists about . 
Another depicts Arayshiyama 's beautiful bamboo grove accompanied with several hashtags , including " # nopeople " and " # nowisthetime . " 
Kyoto has enjoyed many busy traveler filled winters over the past few years , to the point where the city was facing overtourism . 
However , due to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak , locals report that the neighborhood has had fewer visitors so far in 2020 than in 2019 .
