The Tokyo 2020 Olympics flame handover ceremony in Athens this Thursday will be a scaled down event with only a few Tokyo Games officials and torch bearers present to protect everyone from the coronavirus , the Hellenic Olympic Committee ( HOC ) said on Monday . 
The handover ceremony between the Hellenic Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 Organizers will take place inside the ancient Panathenaic Stadium in Athens â€“ the site of the first modern Olympics in 1896 . 
The stadium is closed to the public to stop the spread of the virus . 
The ceremony will include a dance with no more than 10 people and a torch relay with four people : Two from Greece and two from Japan , organizers said in a statemenmt . 
The two torchbearers representing Japan will be Nomura Tadahiro and Yoshida Saori who won gold medals in three straight Olympic Games in the men 's judo and women 's wrestling , respectively . 
Greece last week canceled the remainder of the domestic Olympic Torch Relay through the country to avoid attracting crowds just a day after the Olympic flame was lit in ancient Olympia .
