Tokyo reported 78 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday -- the highest single day increase for Japan 's capital -- as pressure builds to lock down the city . 
The latest rise in people testing positive in Tokyo came as Japan recorded over 200 new coronavirus cases on the same day -- the biggest single day jump during the outbreak , according to public broadcaster NHK . 
On Tuesday , Koike urged Japan ’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to use Tokyo as a reference to decide whether to declare a state of emergency to deal with the coronavirus pandemic , NHK reported . 
" Tokyo is on the verge of an explosive increase of infections . 
We are trying to prevent that situation and trying to prevent further spread ( of the virus ) . 
A decision by the state is needed now , " Koike told reporters Tuesday . 
Lockdown measures : Last Wednesday , Koike urged residents in Tokyo to avoid bars , restaurants and large public gatherings , and telework where possible until April 12 . 
Koike ’s remarks were a test for the city of over roughly 13.5 million people , which until then had been reluctant to impose a lockdown on its residents . 
While other countries have been quick to enforce restrictions on their citizens to contain the spread of the coronavirus , in Japan it 's largely been business as normal .
