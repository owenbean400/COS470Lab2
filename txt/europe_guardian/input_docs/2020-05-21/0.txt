Italy ’s coronavirus death toll in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000 , the national social security agency said Thursday . 
The Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale ( INPS ) , the largest social security and welfare institute in Italy , said in a new study that the official death figures were not " reliable " , according to AFP . 
Its study showed that 156,42 total deaths were recorded in Italy in March and April , which is 46,909 higher than the average number of fatalities in those months recorded between 2015 and 2019 . 
But only 27,938 deaths linked to coronavirus were reported during that period by the Civil Protection Agency , whose toll forms the basis of national statistics , the INPS said . 
That meant there were 18,971 excess deaths during this period , with the vast majority of 18,412 recorded in the coronavirus ravaged north of the country . 
" Given the fact that the number of deaths is quite stable in these times , we can - with necessary caution - attribute a large portion of these deaths during these past two months to the epidemic , " the INPS said . 
It added that the increase in deaths was likely not only due to the disease , but from people suffering from other illnesses unable to get healthcare due to hospitals being overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic . 
As of Friday , the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy , of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone , Europe ’s worst affected region .
