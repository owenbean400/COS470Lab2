France should produce more vital goods , such as drugs and electric batteries , as the coronavirus outbreak highlights the danger of relying on imports from China , the country ’s finance minister said . 
Bruno Le Maire spoke to Reuters on Sunday as the virus spread in Europe , with Italy particularly affected . 
Le Maire said the emergency called for accelerating a shift in industrial policy towards making key goods within national or European Union borders , using state aid when necessary."It ’s not protectionism , it ’s just responsibility , " he said on the sidelines of a meeting of financial leaders in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia."It costs a lot at the starting point so you need the support of public funding . 
China is doing the same , the United States are doing the same , I do not know why Europe would not do the same for strategic assets like electric batteries . "
