The governor of Brazil ’s São Paulo state said that Phase 3 clinical trials of a potential Covid 19 vaccine developed by China ’s Sinovac Biotech have shown promising results and it may be available to Brazilians as early as December . 
Governor João Doria added that Phase 2 trials of the potential vaccine had shown an immune response of 98 % in the elderly . 
Some 9,000 Brazilian volunteers are participating in the Sinovac vaccine trials , which are being conducted by the Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo city and 11 other locations , including the capital , Brasilia . 
Brazil , which has the third worst outbreak of Covid 19 in the world after the US and India , has become a testing ground for at least two vaccine candidates . 
One such vaccine is being developed by Astra Zeneca , which has had to pause global trials after an unexplained illness in a participant in Britain . 
Trials for the Astra Zeneca vaccine on 5,000 volunteers in Brazil are well advanced and have not produced any problems in participants , according to the immunobiology center of Sao Paulo ’s Federal University , which is running the trials . 
Vaccination of volunteers in Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Salvador have been put on hold , but work continues monitoring those who have received the first and even the second dose , a university representative said . 
At the start of next year , Phase 3 trials of Russia ’s Sputnik V Covid 19 vaccine will also be conducted on 10,000 volunteers in Brazil in partnership with the state of Paraná ’s Technology Institute , known as Tecpar . 
On Tuesday , Brazil ’s acting health minister Eduardo Pazuello said a Covid 19 vaccine would be rolled out for all Brazilians in a mass vaccination starting in January .
