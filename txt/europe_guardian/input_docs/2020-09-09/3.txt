US president Donald Trump has pushed back against revelations that he downplayed the coronavirus ’ severity throughout the pandemic , saying he acted in ways to reduce panic among Americans . 
The remarks at the White House came after recordings , obtained by CNN and based on a new book titled Rage by journalist Bob Woodward , showed that Trump acknowledged in February he knew how deadly and contagious the coronavirus was but played it down because he did not want to create panic . 
" I wanted to always play it down , " Trump told Woodward on 19 March , days after he declared a national emergency . 
" I still like playing it down , because I do not want to create a panic . " 
In that conversation , Trump also told Woodward that some " startling facts " had just come out about the virus ’ targets : " It ’s not just old , older . 
Young people too , plenty of young people . " 
Trump on Wednesday defended his handling of the virus , which has killed more than 190,000 people in the US so far , with new cases spiking in the Midwest . 
He said at a Whitehouse event : The fact is I ’m a cheerleader for this country . 
I love our country and I do not want people to be frightened . 
We ’ve done well from any standard .
