The Spanish government said on Saturday it would do whatever was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic and warned that " the worst is yet to come " after the national toll surpassed 1,300 deaths and reached close to 25,000 cases . 
The second worst outbreak in Europe showed no sign of slowing as the death toll jumped by more than 300 from the previous day . 
" We have yet to receive the impact of the strongest , most damaging wave , which will test our material and moral capacities to the limit , as well as our spirit as a society , " Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a news briefing . 
Sanchez said Spain had not lived through such a dramatic situation since its 1936-39 civil war , in which around half a million people died . 
Drawing parallels to a war economy , he said his government was working on plans to produce in Spain the equipment needed to battle coronavirus , such as masks . 
His leftist government a week ago declared a 15 day state of emergency nationwide barring people from all but essential outings . 
Sanchez praised the " exemplary " response and said he had no plans to strengthen the restrictions , which he called the toughest in Europe . 
The prime minister also made no mention of extending the state of emergency , though he warned of tough weeks ahead .
