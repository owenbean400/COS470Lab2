The British government has promised to build thousands of miles of new bike lanes to get people moving and healthy after months of coronavirus lockdown . 
Prime minister Boris Johnson ’s pledge comes on the heels of a plan to force restaurants to display calories on menus as part of a broader effort to combat obesity . 
Government data show two thirds of UK adults are above a healthy weight . 
Some studies suggests that the virus is especially deadly to people who are obese . 
Johnson said : To build a healthier , more active nation , we need the right infrastructure , training and support in place to give people the confidence to travel on two wheels . 
That ’s why now is the time to shift gears and press ahead with our biggest and boldest plans yet to boost active travel - so that everyone can feel the transformative benefits of cycling . 
Johnson introduced a bike sharing programme in London during his spell as the British capital ’s mayor from 2008 to 2016 . 
But the so called " Boris bikes " stood largely untouched during a months long lockdown that still sees swathes of central London stand empty during working hours . 
The government ’s efforts to tease people out of lockdown and into their old spending habits that can give shops and restaurants a boost are complicated by Britain ’s inability to safely reopen its schools . 
Polls show people are also worried about using public transport . 
Many trains and buses are running half empty during morning and evening commutes . 
Johnson ’s plan envisions more Briton ’s biking and walking to work in the long term . 
It promises to build " thousands of miles of protected cycle routes in towns and cities " as part of a £ 2bn ( $ 2.6bn ) " cycling and walking revolution " . 
The government has also promised to start releasing the first batch of £ 50 " bike repair vouchers " to help people get old cycles fixed . 
Britain ’s official virus death toll of 45,759 is the highest in Europe .
