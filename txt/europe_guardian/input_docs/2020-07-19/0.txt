It is better for European Union leaders to agree an ambitious financial aid package for the bloc rather than to have a quick deal at any cost , according to the European Central Bank ’s president Christine Lagarde . 
" Ideally , the leaders ’ agreement should be ambitious in terms of size and composition of the package , broadly along the lines of what has been proposed by the Commission , " Lagarde told Reuters . 
" From my perspective , it ’s better to agree on an ambitious facility along these lines , even if it takes a bit more time . 
I would hope that the leaders agree on something that ’s ambitious rather than fast . " 
A financial aid package designed to lift Europe out of its deepest recession since the second world war hung in the balance at a summit on Sunday as leaders bickered over details for the third straight day , raising the risk that the package could be delayed or drastically watered down .
