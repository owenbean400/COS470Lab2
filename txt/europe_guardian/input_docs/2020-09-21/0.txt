Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš has admitted his government made a mistake when it eased coronavirus restrictions over the summer . 
His mea culpa came as governments across Europe struggle with a second wave of Covid 19 infections following the holiday months in which the number of cases began rising sharply . 
" Even I got carried away by the coming summer and the general mood . 
That was a mistake I do not want to make again , " the Babiš said in a televised speech . 
After fending off much of the pandemic earlier in the year with timely steps including mandatory facemasks outdoors , the government lifted most measures before the summer holidays . 
The Czech Republic registered a record high of 3,130 coronavirus cases last Thursday , almost matching the total for the whole of March , although testing capacity was low at the start of the pandemic . 
Interior minister Jan Hamáček said the country was now ranked second worst in the EU behind Spain in terms of daily case growth per 100,000 residents . 
" The situation is serious . 
Experts say that if we exceed 120,000 new infections per month , we ’ll start running out of hospital beds . 
We ’ll do our best to prevent this , " he said . 
Health minister Adam Vojtěch - a lawyer known for singing in the Czech version of the Idol series - announced his resignation earlier on Monday . 
He was immediately replaced with epidemiologist Roman Prymula , who has helped coordinate government measures to curb infections .
