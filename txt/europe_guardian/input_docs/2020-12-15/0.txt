The share of the Spanish population to have contracted coronavirus has nearly doubled to almost 10 % , or about 4.7 million people , in the second wave of contagion since late summer , results from the latest stage of a nationwide antibody study showed . 
More than 51,400 people were tested and surveyed across Spain in the second half of November for the prevalence study , which suggests the infections by far exceed the number of confirmed cases in Spain , of just over 1.75 million . 
" One in 10 people living in Spain would have been infected ... half during the first wave and the other half during this second epidemic wave , " said Raquel Yotti , director of Spain ’s Carlos III health institute , which co led the study . 
Prevalence in Madrid was the highest of all Spanish regions , with 18.6 % of the population testing positive for Covid 19 antibodies . 
Previous results of the study - published in July after testing nearly 70,000 people in April June - showed a prevalence rate of just over 5 % . 
Spain has been one of Europe ’s hardest hit countries by the pandemic , both in terms of contagion and the economic impact . 
A total of 48,401 people have died from the coronavirus , with the toll climbing by 388 over the last 24 hours . 
Data from the health ministry also showed 10,328 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday , bringing the total since the onset of the pandemic to 1,762,212 infections . 
The infection rate measured over the previous 14 days is up for a second day in a row at nearly 199 cases per 100,000 people . 
The government decided a second state of emergency in October with new restrictions such as night time curfews to stem resurgent infections , which helped to reduce new cases to less than 200 per 100,000 people this month .
