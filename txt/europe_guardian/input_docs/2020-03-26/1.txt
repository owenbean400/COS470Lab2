South Africa came under a nationwide military patrolled lockdown on Friday , joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent . 
Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa ’s three week total lockdown which began at midnight . 
Kenya , Rwanda and Mali are some of the African countries that have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus , which has been confirmed to have infected 3,203 people and killed 87 . 
Although Africa ’s toll is far lower than in Europe , the United States and the Middle East , health experts say the world ’s poorest continent is especially vulnerable and the figures likely fall far short of the reality . 
Donning camouflage uniform complete with a cap , president Cyril Ramaphosa saw off soldiers before they deployed from a military base in Soweto township outside economic hub Johannesburg . 
" I send you out to go and defend our people against coronavirus , " Ramaphosa said . 
" This is unprecedented , not only in our democracy but also in the history of our country , that we will have a lockdown for 21 days to go out and wage war against an invisible enemy coronavirus , " he said . 
During South Africa ’s shutdown there will be no jogging , dog walking or sale of alcohol across the country , which so far has the highest number of detected infections in sub Saharan Africa at 927 , with Ramaphosa projecting it could reach 1,500 " within a few days " .
