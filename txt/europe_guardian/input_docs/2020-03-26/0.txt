European Union lawmakers approved on Thursday emergency funds to cushion the bloc ’s economic slump triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and shore up battered airlines by preserving their landing slots . 
Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) gave near unanimous support for three sets of proposals at the conclusion of a session that spanned more than 12 hours . 
It was the parliament ’s first ever remote vote following the suspension of meetings due to the risk of coronavirus transmission . 
Only a handful of lawmakers gathered in the Brussels plenary chamber with the most of the 688 participating MEPs scattered under lockdown across Europe . 
" From one day to the next , our lifestyles changed . 
Our streets emptied . 
Our doors closed . 
And we moved from a daily routine to the fight of our lives , " the head of the EU executive , Ursula von der Leyen , told the gathering . 
Wearing white , latex protective gloves , she called on the chamber to vote into law a special 37 billion euro fund to allow the 27 member states to spend more to prop up their economies . 
The legislation will also allow an existing natural disaster fund to support strained public health services across the EU . 
The assembly also supported the suspension of a rule that strips airlines of their landing slots if they do not run most of their scheduled services - to ease an industry crisis unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic .
