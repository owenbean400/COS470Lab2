Residents of major French cities including the Paris region are to be confined to their homes between 9pm and 6am , Emmanuel Macron has said , as governments across Europe battle to contain record numbers of Covid 19 infections . 
The French president used a prime time TV interview on Wednesday to announce the curfew , which will be in place for four weeks from midnight on Saturday and will affect nine cities including Marseille , Lyon , Toulouse and Lille . 
Macron said : The situation is worrying but not out of control . 
We are in a second wave that is happening all across Europe . 
France ’s health ministry on Wednesday announced 22,950 new coronavirus cases and said 32 % of the country ’s intensive care beds were occupied by patients with Covid 19 . 
The government restored a national state of health emergency minutes before the president spoke . 
Macron said the objective was to reduce the number of new infections per day to between 3,000 and 5,000 , and he warned that the country would have to live with the virus until at least next summer . 
He said : We have to act . 
We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus . 
We have to reduce the number of social contacts … of festive contacts , that are taking place . 
It will demand a big effort from everyone – but it is necessary . 
A full nationwide lockdown would be " disproportionate " , Macron said , and state aid would again be available to employers in sectors that would be most affected , such as hospitality and entertainment . 
" People will have to forget about night time visits to restaurants or to friends ’ houses , " he said . 
Essential trips during curfew would still be allowed , but people breaking the new rules would face a fine of € 135 ( £ 120 ) .
