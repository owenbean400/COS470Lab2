British drugmaker Astra Zeneca told Reuters its Covid 19 vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant , adding studies were underway to fully probe the impact of the mutation . 
" AZD1222 ( Astra Zeneca ’s vaccine candidate ) contains the genetic material of the SARS Co V 2 virus spike protein , and the changes to the genetic code seen in this new viral strain do not appear to change the structure of the spike protein , " an Astra Zeneca representative said . 
Drugmakers are scrambling to test their Covid 19 vaccines against the new fast spreading variant of the virus that is spreading in Britain , the latest challenge in the breakneck race to curb the pandemic . 
" Through vaccination with AZD1222 , the body ’s immune system is trained to recognise many different parts of the spike protein , so that it can eliminate the virus if it is later exposed , " the Astra Zeneca representative added . 
The mutation , known as the B.1.1.7 lineage , may be up to 70 % more infectious and more of a concern for children . 
It has sown chaos in Britain , prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe . 
The Astra Zeneca Oxford shot is considered vital for lower income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper , easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal refrigerator temperatures . 
Data from Astra Zeneca ’s late stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62 % for trial participants given two full doses , but 90 % for a smaller sub group given a half , then a full dose . 
Reuters reported late on Tuesday that India is likely to approve Astra Zeneca ’s vaccine for emergency use by next week .
