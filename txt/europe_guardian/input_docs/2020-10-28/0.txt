Turkey has become the eighth country in Europe to record more than 10,000 deaths , with 77 new fatalities registered on Wednesday taking the total there to 10,027 . 
The health minister , Fahrettin Koca , said Istanbul was now recording nearly half of Turkey ’s new infections , describing the rise as " scary " . 
" If we cannot control the virus in Istanbul , it will be hard to tackle , " he said , according to AFP . 
While the WHO has praised Turkey ’s early adoption of masks , it has also criticised the government for only counting " patients " , or cases where people display symptoms – which is likely to give a much lower count than the true total . 
Turkey recorded 2,305 new " patients " on Wednesday and has counted nearly 370,000 since the crisis began .
