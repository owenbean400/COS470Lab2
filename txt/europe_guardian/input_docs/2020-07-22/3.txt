Bolivia ’s plan to hold elections in September is increasingly in doubt amid rising coronavirus deaths , and reports that police have recovered the bodies of hundreds of suspected Covid 19 victims . 
In the past five days , a special police unit had found 420 bodies in streets , vehicles and homes in the capital , La Paz , and in Bolivia ’s biggest city , Santa Cruz , authorities said on Tuesday . 
Between 80 % and 90 % of them are believed to have had the virus . 
Elections scheduled for September were seen as a key step in stabilising Bolivia ’s democracy after a year of political tumult that reached its peak in November when Evo Morales was forced to resign as president by the military . 
But , this week , a committee that advises the health ministry on outbreak containment measures said in a letter to the country ’s top election official that holding the elections as scheduled would not be advisable because of the rapid spread of the virus .
