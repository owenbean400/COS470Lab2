The UK government ’s flagship test and trace system is failing to contact thousands of people in areas with the highest infection rates in England , raising further questions about the £ 10bn programme described by Boris Johnson as " world beating " . 
Local leaders and directors of public health are demanding more control over the tracing operation amid concerns that their ability to contain the virus is being put at risk . 
Data obtained by the Guardian shows that in areas with the highest infection rates in England , the proportion of close contacts of infected people being reached is far below 80 % , the level the government ’s scientific advisers say is required for test and trace to be effective .
