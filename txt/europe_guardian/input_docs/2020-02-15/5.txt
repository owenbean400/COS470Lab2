Australia is dispatching a medical expert to Japan to assist the country ’s response to the quarantined cruise ship in Yokohama on which there are more than 200 confirmed coronavirus cases . 
The infectious disease expert will bolster an international team gathering details about the Diamond Princess ’s 3,000 plus passengers and crew , including 200 Australians . 
It follows the Australian government extending the country ’s two week travel ban from mainland China for another seven days this week to prevent the spread of the disease . 
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says keeping Australians safe from the virus is " absolutely paramount " , but concedes that it is a " savage blow " to tourism . 
" The ban on passenger air travel also impacts on a range of other industries that depend on frequent air movements to shift goods , including perishable products , " the body ’s tourism executive chair , John Hart , said in a statement . 
" Tourism and trade would greatly benefit from even a partial lifting of the ban from provinces in China that present a much lower risk to Australians . "
