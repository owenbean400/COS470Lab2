As news filters through of Europe ’s first coronavirus death , here ’s some expert reaction . 
Dr Andrew Freedman , reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician , Cardiff University School of Medicine , said : This first reported death in Europe from Covid 19 in an 80 year old man comes as no surprise . 
Although the mortality rate is low – probably less than 2 % , we know that the risk of severe disease and death is greatest in the elderly as well as those with underlying co morbidities such as diabetes and chronic respiratory disease . 
It is still the case that the vast majority of infections are relatively mild with full recovery . " 
Dr Robin Thompson , junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology , University of Oxford , added : Given that we have now seen 46 coronavirus cases in total in Europe , it is unsurprising that we have seen our first death . 
The most important thing to point out , however , is that there still has not been sustained person to person transmission in Europe . 
As a result , the risk to individuals in the UK remains low . "
