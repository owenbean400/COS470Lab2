Five members of a ski group who stayed at a French chalet visited by the businessman Steve Walsh , who has been linked to 11 cases of coronavirus , say they are looking forward to returning home after beating the disease . 
The patients , who are among eight released from hospital in the UK after recovering from coronavirus , said in a joint statement that they were " feeling well and looking forward to being home " . 
They were at the same chalet as Walsh , a scout leader from Hove , who was the first British national identified as having caught the virus . 
He said on Tuesday that he had fully recovered . 
In a statement , the five group members said : " All of our group , including the six in other countries , have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation . 
" We understand the virus can be dangerous for some , but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people . 
" We want to thank everybody who has been involved in our care , in particular the NHS nurses and doctors who have looked after us over the past few days . 
" We would also like to thank our families , friends , work colleagues and members of the public for their support . "
