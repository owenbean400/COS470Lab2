The death toll in Europe ’s largest coronavirus outbreak has risen to seven on Monday and new cases climbed above 220 as Italy shut down much of its wealthy north to curb the disease ’s spread . 
Italian shares tumbled more than 5 % , the biggest daily drop in almost four years , on worries the flare up could cause a recession , while worried residents emptied supermarket shelves to stock up on essentials . 
Authorities in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto , the industrial and financial heartlands of Italy , shut schools , universities , museums and cinemas for at least a week , and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival . 
In Lombardy , close to Italy ’s business capital Milan , nearly 50,000 people have been placed under effective quarantine , as measures were adopted for 10 towns , as well as a further one in neighbouring Veneto . 
" To be honest , nobody thought the spread would be so aggressive , " Lombardy regional governor Attilio Fontana told 102.5 RTL radio , predicting , however that the virus would regress in days due to the emergency measures . 
Local authorities announced four new deaths on Monday – three men in their 80s and a 62 year old . 
Three previous fatalities recorded since Friday were also elderly people . 
All those who have died had underlying health problems . 
Lombardy remained the worst hit region with 172 confirmed cases , while neighbouring Veneto had 33 infections , including four in Venice , which had been packed with tourists before its carnival was curtailed two days ahead of schedule . 
At national level , 27 people were in intensive care , 101 hospitalised and 94 being monitored at home , officials said . 
Earlier reports from Ansa incorrectly put the death toll at seven and were corrected to six later on Monday . 
Local authorities have now clarified that the toll has since risen to seven people .
