Spain ’s congress has voted to approve a sixth and final two week extension of the country ’s state of emergency , which has been in effect since 14 March , writes Sam Jones , the Guardian ’s Madrid correspondent . 
Wednesday ’s vote means that the exceptional measures that have underpinned one of Europe ’s strictest Covid 19 lockdowns will now remain in force until 21 June . 
The prime minister , Pedro Sánchez , said that the last extension was needed to preserve the gains made against the virus over the past three months , but added that the country ’s gradual loosening of lockdown restrictions was going well . 
" We will keep on asking for prudence , prudence and prudence , " said Sánchez . 
" We will remain alert until the risk disappears . 
And , after that , we will keep working to learn for the new pandemics that we have a duty to prevent . " 
The extension was approved despite fierce opposition from the conservative People ’s party and the far right Vox , both of which accuse the government of unnecessarily curtailing people ’s freedoms . 
To date , Spain has reported 27,128 deaths from the virus and 240,326 confirmed infections .
