Some more detail on news the Dutch government has tightened some of Europe ’s most relaxed coronavirus rules after a surge in cases , ordering bars to shut early and recommending people wear masks in shops . 
The prime minister , Mark Rutte , told a news conference that the situation in the country ’s three largest cities , Amsterdam , Rotterdam and The Hague , had become " serious " and required urgent action . 
" We ’re doing our best , but the virus is doing better , " said the country ’s health minister , Hugo de Jonge , adding that nearly 3,000 new infections were being recorded a day , with the figure expected to reach 5,000 within weeks . 
The Netherlands has so far avoided the harsh measures introduced by its European neighbours , preferring a so called " intelligent lockdown " and refusing to order the wearing of masks . 
But people were now advised to wear masks while shopping in the three big cities , with retailers allowed to refuse entry to those who did not , Rutte said . 
However , Rutte said that masks - which are already compulsory on public transport – " wo not do the big trick " and had not worked in France or Spain by themselves . 
Restaurants and bars must now close at 10pm , while people may only have four people to visit over the age of 13 , Rutte said . 
Sports matches will be played behind closed doors again , including top tier Eredivisie football , which had only just begun its new season with a limited number of spectators . 
Rutte had warned fans recently to " keep their mouths shut " after many had defied a ban on chanting . 
Working from home should once again become standard , de Jonge said .
