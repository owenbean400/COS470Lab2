A school in Liverpool has joined a growing list to have sent home pupils and staff over coronavirus fears following a trip to northern Italy . 
Cardinal Heenan Catholic high school in West Derby said pupils and staff went on the ski trip during half term but did not visit any of the towns currently under quarantine in Italy . 
All staff and pupils were medically screened on entry to and from Milan airport and , as a precautionary measure , the school has sent all of these pupils and staff home . 
In a letter and email issued to all parents , the headteacher Karen Smyth said the latest advice from officials is that anyone who has visited the northern areas of Italy should isolate themselves if they show symptoms of the coronavirus , contact NHS 111 or their GP by phone but do not visit the surgery or any walk in centres . 
The school will monitor the potential symptoms within the pupil and staff populations , in particular those who travelled on the ski trip . 
The letter adds : " It is important to recognise that the risk of catching coronavirus is minimal . "
