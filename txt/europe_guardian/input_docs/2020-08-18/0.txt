Ireland significantly tightened its nationwide coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday to rein in an increase in cases , urging everyone to restrict visitors to their homes , avoid public transport and for older people to limit their contacts . 
A surge in cases over the last three weeks after Ireland had one of Europe ’s lowest infection rates for several weeks , pushed the country ’s 14 day cumulative cases per 100,000 population to 26 and led to the first local lockdown last week . 
The 190 new cases on Tuesday , the second highest daily rise since early May , took the rate of growth in the last two weeks to the fourth highest in Europe and meant infections would inevitably spread to the most vulnerable if it continued , the prime minister Micheal Martin said . 
" We ’re absolutely not at a stage where we can return to normality . 
We are at another critical moment , " the Taoiseach told a news conference , saying the new measures would stay in place until 13 September . 
Ireland has adopted one of the most cautious approaches in Europe in fighting the virus , reopening its economy at a slower pace and keeping many restrictions in place for longer . 
The government has already twice delayed the final phase of its reopening plan that would allow nightclubs and all pubs to open , having sped up the plan in June when cases began to fall . 
As well as cutting to six the number of visitors allowed in a home - where most clusters have occurred - outdoor gatherings are being restricted to 15 people from 200 , with all fans banned from sport . 
Police will get greater powers to enforce the rules . 
Restaurants and pubs that serve food can stay open . 
Martin said the aim of the restrictions was to make sure key parts of the economy kept trading and schools could reopen for the first time since March . 
" Schools are so important to children in general , to society , to the economy as well , that we want our schools to reopen , and our schools will reopen , " Martin said .
