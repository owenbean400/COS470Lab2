France registered 3,776 new Covid 19 infections on Wednesday , marking another post lockdown peak and bringing the total to 225,043 , but president Emmanuel Macron again ruled out imposing another national lockdown . 
" All the indicators keep going up and the transmission of the virus is getting stronger among all ages groups affected , young adults in particular " , the health ministry said in a statement . 
It said the virus was especially active in and around Paris and Marseille , the country ’s two biggest cities . 
Some medical experts are worried about the impact of Paris St Germain fans ’ wild , mask less celebrations on the Champs Elysees avenue in central Paris after their soccer club reached the Champions League final on Tuesday . 
Paris municipal officials are also concerned about large gatherings of fans expected on Sunday , when Paris St Germain will play the final either against Olympique Lyonnais , another French club , or Germany ’s Bayern Munich . 
Despite the surge in infections , Macron told Paris Match magazine in an interview that " local strategies " were preferable to another national lockdown , which he said would cause considerable " collateral damage " . 
The seven day moving average of the case tally , which smooths out daily reporting irregularities , is now at 2,621 , above the 2,500 threshold for the first time since 19 April , when France was enforcing one of Europe ’s strictest lockdowns . 
The number of people in hospital fell again by 17 to 4,806 and those in intensive care slipped by six to 374 , reflecting the preponderance of younger people among the new cases who are more likely to be asymptomatic or not to fall seriously ill . 
Both numbers had been on an uninterrupted downward trend since early April , but that trend has slowed in the past two weeks . 
The number of deaths increased by 17 to 30,468 , following an increase of 22 on Tuesday and of 19 on Monday .
