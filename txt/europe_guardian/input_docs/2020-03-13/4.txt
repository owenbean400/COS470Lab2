The former chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners , Clare Gerada , has confirmed she contracted the virus â€“ and is now recovering : Pleased to say am on the mend after an unwelcome visit from Covid 19 ( courtesy of New York ) . 
At least now I have immunity I can help out in the front line of care with less fear . 
Experience was worse than child birth ! 
Worst case of the flu I have ever had but spent most of it half awake . 
NOw very fatigued . 
Hopefully back to normal by Sunday . 
But still isolate for another few days after
