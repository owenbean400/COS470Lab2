As my colleague Helena Smith reported earlier , Greek ’s holiday resorts are readying themselves for the beginning of the country ’s tourist season . 
Vasilis Theodorou , the owner of Pelican , a new restaurant on the Greek island of Mykonos , expects a slow slummer but says he ’s in a hurry to get back to business , the Associated Press reports . 
And so is the rest of the country . 
Heavily reliant on tourism , the country is officially reopening to foreigners on Monday after closing its borders to most during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Its hopes are pinned on popular tourist destinations such as Mykonos and the islands of Rhodes , Corfu , Crete and Santorini , where regular ferry service already resumed and direct international flights are set to restart on 1 July . 
Mykonos would normally be packed in early June , but it ’s beaches were empty . 
" Tourism might be down by as much as 80 per cent this year , so we ’re waiting for the 20 per cent , and we ’re happy , " Theodorou said . 
" No matter how much we wish for it and want it , it wo not be more than that , " he said . 
" We expect that tourists from central Europe will come first , and hopefully Americans at a later stage . 
They are our best customers . " 
Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged Saturday that Greece is prepared for a huge drop from the 33 million tourists who came to visit last year .
