Germany recorded more than one million cases on Friday . 
Until recently , Germany ’s relative success in containing the virus had offered some sense of hope , with authorities putting in place some precautions that still allowed life to carry on almost as normal . 
However , its measured approach has failed during the second wave , endangering the health of Europe ’s biggest economy and weighing on the mood as the northern hemisphere heads into the winter holidays . 
Germany ’s Robert Koch Institute recorded more than 22,000 new daily cases on Friday , pushing the overall total beyond the one million mark . 
The number of Covid 19 patients in intensive care has soared from around 360 in early October to more than 3,500 last week .
