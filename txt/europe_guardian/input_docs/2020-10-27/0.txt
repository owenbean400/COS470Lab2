Nearly 200 airports across the UK and Europe are at risk of going bust within months due to the dramatic collapse in air travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic , the European airports trade body has warned . 
Airports Council International Europe ( ACI Europe ) , which represents airport operators , said it estimated that 193 out of Europe ’s 740 commercial airports face " insolvency in the coming months if passenger traffic does not start to recover by the year end " . 
The trade body said the at risk airports employed 277,000 people and generated collective annual revenues of € 12.4bn ( £ 11.2bn ) . 
Olivier Jankovec , the director general of ACI Europe , said the figures " paint a dramatically bleak picture " for the future of the aviation industry , which has already suffered tens of thousands of job losses . 
Eight months into the crisis , all of Europe ’s airports are burning through cash to remain open , with revenues far from covering the costs of operations , let alone capital costs . 
Governments ’ current imposition of quarantines rather than testing is bringing Europe ’s airports closer to the brink with every day that passes .
