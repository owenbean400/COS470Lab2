Italian police have fired teargas at demonstrators protesting virus restrictions for the second night running , as dire figures on global tourism and investment highlighted the devastating economic impact of the pandemic . 
Thousands protested again in Italian cities with the cry of " freedom " punctuated by clashes with police , with many traders and employees fearing a second wave economic slump as much as the rising virus numbers . 
The protesters are upset at the mandatory early closure of restaurants and other businesses . 
Some of the rallies have turned violent , particularly in Milan and Turin on Monday night , where angry youths threw petrol bombs and stones at police cars and smashed up shop fronts . 
The clashes are " a black page " in Turin ’s history , said local police chief Giuseppe De Matteis , " which cannot be attributed to social discontent but ... to orchestration by individuals dedicated to crime " . 
Late on Tuesday , the Italian government announced the release of € 5bn ( $ 5.9bn ) of funding for the worst hit businesses , including restaurants , taxi drivers and live entertainment venues . 
However , unhappiness over the measures in Italy and elsewhere in Europe - once again the global centre of the pandemic - is palpable among the business owners and residents who are once again facing lengthy restrictions as economies struggle to recover .
