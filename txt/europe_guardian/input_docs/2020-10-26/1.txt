Some doctors and nurses in Belgium who have tested positive for Covid 19 have been requested to keep working if they have no symptoms , the BBC has reported . 
Several hospitals in the city of Liège have made the request as they deal with a surge in coronavirus admissions . 
One of the worst affected areas in Europe , hospitals in the city have started transferring patients elsewhere and cancelled all non urgent surgery , and the situation is exacerbated by a shortage of staff . 
A quarter of medical staff in Liège are reported to be off work with Covid 19 , the BBC reports , and another 10 % of staff who have tested positive but are asymptomatic have been asked to continue working . 
The president of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions , Dr Philippe Devos , said there is a risk of passing on the virus to patients but the hospital system could collapse within days if action is not taken .
