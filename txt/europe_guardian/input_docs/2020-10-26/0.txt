Britain has announced wider coronavirus measures which will take the number of people under England ’s highest category of restrictions to nearly 8 million . 
The number of new Covid cases has risen by almost a quarter over the past week to 153,483 , and new Covid deaths were 50 % higher than the week before , at 1,272 , taking fatalities over the course of the pandemic to 44,998 , the highest in Europe . 
From 0001 GMT on Tuesday Warrington in northwest England will be classified as the highest Tier 3 alert level , Britain ’s health ministry said . 
Local authorities in Nottingham in central England and three nearby towns said they would have similar restrictions from Thursday , the first areas outside northern England to be placed in Tier 3 . 
Under these curbs , people from different households are no longer allowed to socialise outdoors , adding to an existing ban on indoor socialising in much of England , while pubs and bars that do not serve food must shut . 
More than seven million people across northern England , including major cities such as Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield , are already under these restrictions . 
Schools , shops and restaurants in England are allowed to stay open , unlike the first lockdown in March and April . 
Other parts of the UK have imposed stricter curbs than Britain ’s central government , which only has direct control over health policy in England . 
Wales has shut all non essential retailers , pubs and restaurants in a 17 day lockdown which began on Friday , and Scotland has severe curbs on hospitality across most of the country . 
Pubs , restaurants and hairdressers are also closed in Northern Ireland until 13 November .
