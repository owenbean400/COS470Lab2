Russia has registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the sixth day in a row , after emerging as a new hotspot of the pandemic . 
A government tally on Friday showed 10,669 new cases over the last 24 hours , fewer than Thursday â€™s record of 11,231 , bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 187,859 . 
The country also recorded 98 new deaths from the virus , for a total of 1,723 , and while some officials are considering softening the current lockdown , the WHO warned Russia is going through a " delayed epidemic . " 
Russia now ranks fourth in Europe in terms of the total number of cases , according to an AFP tally , behind countries where the epidemic hit considerably earlier : Britain , Italy and Spain . 
WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in a virtual briefing that " Russia is probably experiencing a delayed epidemic " and must " learn some of the lessons " which came at great cost in other parts of the world . 
On Thursday , Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced an extension of a lockdown in the capital , where most cases are concentrated , to May 31 . 
He also brought in a rule that people must wear masks and gloves in public transport and shops and announced that lockdown will be lifted for industries and construction projects . 
Residents of the capital are only allowed to leave their homes for brief trips to a shop , to walk dogs or to travel to essential jobs with a permit .
