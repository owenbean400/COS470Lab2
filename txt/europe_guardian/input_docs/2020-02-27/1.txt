MSF has accused Italian authorities of discriminatory action after one of their search and rescue vessels in the Mediterranean was put under quarantine following the disembarkation of 276 passengers who had been rescued at sea . 
The Ocean Viking has 32 crew and one journalist aboard , and is among the search and rescue vessels which patrol for boats carrying migrants fleeing to Europe . 
MSF said the vessel had complied with all measures and had been anchored off Sicily for nearly five days , and accused authorities of " discriminatorily applying " quarantine restrictions to search and rescue vessels . 
Michael Fark , Head of Mission for Libya and Search and Rescue Operations said : " Quarantining the Ocean Viking is equivalent to stopping an ambulance in the middle of an emergency . 
This is a discriminatory action â€“ the only vessels that have been put into quarantine are those conducting rescues . 
In the past 48 hours we have had reports of boats in distress in the central Mediterranean . 
We are deeply worried about the fate of people travelling in them . 
Although we have fully complied with the preventive measures , we currently have no reason to suspect any of the crew onboard as having contracted , or having been exposed to , the virus . 
In compliance with a request from Italian authorities , the temperature and health status of all is being checked and reported by MSF medical team onboard twice daily . 
As the conflict in Libya escalates , migrants and refugees trapped in the country say they have no other choice but to risk their lives to escape across the Mediterranean . 
It is urgent for the Ocean Viking to go back to sea to rescue men , women and children from drowning . 
The legitimate public health concerns posed by Covid 19 should not be used to justify the prevention of saving lives as sea . "
