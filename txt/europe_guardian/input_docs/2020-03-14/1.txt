Major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths have announced further restrictions on items such as toilet paper and non perishable foods as they struggle to cope with panic buying . 
The Woolworths website currently appears to be offline as people flock to the site to make purchases . 
In a continued effort to ensure our customers have the opportunity to purchase grocery items Coles have implemented a few more changes . 
For updates on product availability & amp ; the temporary suspension to our change of mind policy please head to our website .
