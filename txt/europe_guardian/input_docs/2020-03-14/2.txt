Earlier in the day Australia ’s shadow health minister Chris Bowen slammed the prime minister Scott Morrison ’s handling of the virus . 
Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister ’s were not tested after the home affairs minister Peter Dutton was diagnosed with Covid 19 on Friday . 
Dutton has now been admitted to hospital . 
Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self isolation and testing . 
But in a press conference immediately after Bowen ’s , Australia ’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy backed Morrison ’s decision not to get tested . 
Murphy said ; 
No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic , nor was I in fact in contact with him . 
So the prime minister was very , very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community . 
If there had been a requirement for quarantine , he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules , so we just follow the normal public health advice , no one had been in contact with the minister in that period . 
Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24 hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation . 
Murphy said : That has always been our public health advice . 
So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic , they are very , very , very unlikely to be infectious so we do not believe you need to quarantine . 
This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms , such as coughing and spluttering .
