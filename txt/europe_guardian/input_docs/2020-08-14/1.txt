Coronavirus outbreaks are taking place across Europe and it is up to each country to decide on how to tackle them , Spain â€™s foreign minister said on Friday as Germany declared most of her country a risk region . 
Germany followed the UK in imposing quarantine on people returning from Spain , further damaging hopes of a swift revival for tourism , which usually accounts for around 12 % of the Spanish economy . 
" New outbreaks are the norm , they are not the exception , in Spain or any other country in the European Union , " Arancha Gonzalez Laya told Reuters in an interview . 
" Every country is taking measures to fight Covid ... that they think are necessary to protect their citizens . 
We do not question the measures other countries take . " 
Some regions within Spain itself have limited movement with neighbouring areas to isolate flare ups of the disease , " showing that this is not a question of diplomacy or politics , it is a question of epidemiology , " she said . 
Spain recorded almost 3,000 new cases on Friday , about double the average in the first 12 days of August , bringing the cumulative total to 342,813 - the highest in Western Europe . 
Earlier on Friday , Spain announced a series of measures limiting nightlife , including closing clubs and bars . 
Asked whether the limits would impact tourism and the economy , Gonzalez Laya said : " The main question today is how do we make sure we limit infection and the expansion of Covid in the country . "
