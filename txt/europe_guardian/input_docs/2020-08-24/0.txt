" Brussels , together with large parts of Spain and Moldova , is in the top 10 regions with the largest Covid19 increase this week , " Van Ranst said . 
" The politicians of the Brussels Capital Region should consider how they can either better enforce or tighten up the corona measures . " 
Brussel zit samen met grote delen van Spanje en MoldaviÃ« bij de top 10 regio 's met de grootste Covid19 stijging deze week . 
De politici van het Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest zouden best nadenken hoe ze de corona maatregelen ofwel beter kunnen handhaven ofwel kunnen verstrengen . 
Authorities have been focusing on clusters in Antwerp , The Brussels Times reports , but Van Ranst suggested that measures adopted by local authorities have helped slow down the spread there . 
The latest protective measures in Brussels mean it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public , but officials have stopped short of stricter measures .
