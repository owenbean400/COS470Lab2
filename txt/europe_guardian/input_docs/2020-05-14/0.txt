The Augsburg coach , Heiko Herrlich , will miss the restart of the German season on Saturday after he broke strict quarantine rules by leaving the team hotel to buy toothpaste . 
Augsburg host Wolfsburg as the Bundesliga becomes the first of Europe â€™s major leagues to resume since the onset of the coronavirus crisis . 
The club said in a statement that , by leaving the hotel , Herrlich had broken rules set up by a German Football League task force . 
" I made a mistake by leaving the hotel , " said Herrlich , who was due to coach Augsburg in a match for the first time on Saturday . 
" Even though I followed all hygiene measures both when I left the hotel and otherwise , I cannot undo this . 
" In this situation I did not live up to my role model function towards my team and the public . 
I will therefore be consistent and stand by my mistake . 
Because of this mistake I will not lead the training tomorrow and I will not coach the team in the match against Wolfsburg on Saturday . "
