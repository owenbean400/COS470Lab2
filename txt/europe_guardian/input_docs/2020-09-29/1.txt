The French president , Emmanuel Macron , has called for the European parliament to return to its seat in Strasbourg as soon as possible , after meetings were moved to Brussels amid the coronavirus outbreak . 
" I strongly defend the idea that the European parliament should meet in Strasbourg , " Macron told students in Vilnius on the second day of a Lithuanian visit . 
If we accept that the European parliament meets only in Brussels we are screwed , because in ten years everything will be in Brussels . 
And people will be talking only among themselves in Brussels . 
This is not the idea of Europe . 
On Monday , the European parliament Speaker , David Sassoli , said MEPs will not be returning to Strasbourg just yet , despite a plea from Macron for an 5-8 October session to be held in the usual place . 
The parliament has its headquarters in the eastern French city , where MEPs usually based in Brussels travel every month for 12 plenary sessions a year . 
These have been held exclusively in Brussels , where the parliament also has a chamber , since March due to concerns over spreading the virus . 
Sassoli said Monday that parliament â€™s return to Strasbourg had been agreed " once the conditions allow " . 
This would not be next week , however , " given the increased rate of transmission of the virus in France , including in Bas Rhin " where Strasbourg is located .
