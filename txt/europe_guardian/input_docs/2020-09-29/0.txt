Ukraine ’s former president , Petro Poroshenko , has tested positive for Covid 19 as the pandemic situation worsens across the country . 
" I got a positive test for Covid 19 , " the 55 year old ex president wrote on Twitter , adding that he is undergoing treatment at home . 
Отримав позитивний тест на Covid . 
Невчасно . 
Дуже шкодую , що змушений зробити перерву в поїздках регіонами . 
За шість останніх років звик переносити хвороби на ногах . 
Але ця підступніша . 
Значно підступніша . 
Тому від сьогодні лікуюся вдома . 
Закликаю всіх українців берегти себе ! 
Poroshenko – now a lawmaker – has diabetes , which has been associated with an increased risk of developing complications from the coronavirus . 
The former president added that he is not used to taking sick leave , but Covid 19 is " much more treacherous " . 
Poroshenko led Ukraine after Russia ’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of a Moscow backed separatist conflict in country ’s east . 
In 2019 he was trounced in a presidential election by Volodymyr Zelensky , a comedian with no previous political experience . 
Ukraine , one of Europe ’s poorest countries with a population of some 40 million , has reported more than 204,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 4,000 fatalities .
