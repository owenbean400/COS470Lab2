A " no deal " Brexit could be three times more costly to Britain ’s economy in the long term than the coronavirus outbreak , a new study published on Tuesday has warned . 
The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe said the political and economic effects of the pandemic were likely to mitigate or hide that of failing to secure a trade agreement with the EU . 
But in the short term , the lack of a new formal trading relationship with Brussels would be bad news for economic recovery , and its impact larger than that of the health crisis in the long term . 
The thinktank , which collaborated with the London School of Economics ( LSE ) , said Brexit would hit growth in the coming years more than if the UK had opted to remain in the bloc . 
Its authors wrote : The claim that the economic impacts of Covid 19 dwarf those of Brexit is almost certainly correct in the short term . 
Not even the most pessimistic scenarios suggest that a no deal Brexit would lead to a fall in output comparable to that seen in the second quarter of 2020 . 
However - assuming a reasonably strong recovery , and that government policies succeed in avoiding persistent mass unemployment - in the long run , Brexit is likely to be more significant . 
Our modelling with LSE of the impact of a no deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England ’s forecast for the impact of Covid 19 . 
The study estimated that the negative impact on gross domestic product would be 5.7 % over the next 15 years compared with the current level , while GDP was forecast to take a 2.1 % hit from Covid 19 . 
The projections come despite a lack of clarity about the overall repercussions from the pandemic , and as a second wave of infections hits Europe .
