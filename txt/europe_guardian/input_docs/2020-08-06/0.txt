A rise in the Covid 19 infection rate in Ireland is a " serious concern " but the country has not yet seen a significant resurgence in infections outside of identified clusters , a leading health official said . 
Ireland , which for several weeks had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe , has seen a spike since last Thursday and has identified a number of clusters of infections in meat plants and accommodation for asylum seekers . 
The reproduction value , or the number of people who become infected from each positive case , has increased to 1.8 from 1.3 a week ago , professor Philip Nolan , the chairman of the country ’s Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group , said . 
A reproduction number of almost 2 is a serious concern , and although we have not yet seen a significant increase in community transmission , there is a significant risk this could develop over the coming days and weeks . 
Ireland reported 69 cases on Thursday and the average infection rate has more than doubled in recent weeks to around 50 per day . 
It also reported five deaths on Thursday after six days with no deaths . 
Acting chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said half of all recent cases had come from three adjoining counties - Kildare , Laois and Offaly - and that a cluster of 60 cases from the counties were set to be added to Friday ’s numbers . 
He warned people from those counties to be particularly careful and said he could not rule out specific restrictions being imposed on those three counties .
