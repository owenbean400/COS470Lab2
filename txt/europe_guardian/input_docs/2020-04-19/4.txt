Wearing face masks , waving black flags and keeping two yards apart , thousands of Israelis demonstrated against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu under strict coronavirus restrictions on Sunday . 
Netanyahu , who denies any wrongdoing , is under criminal indictment in three corruption cases . 
He is also negotiating a power sharing deal with his rival Benny Gantz to form a coalition government that would end a year of political deadlock after three inconclusive elections . 
Demonstrations are allowed under Israel ’s coronavirus restrictions , as long as participants maintain distance from each other and wear face masks . 
Under the banner of " Save the Democracy , " protesters called on Gantz ’s Blue and White party not to join in a coalition led by a premier charged with corruption .
