Tunisia is extending its lockdown to 4 May , then it will ease restrictions gradually on some economic activities , prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said . 
The government has said it expected Tunisia ’s economy would shrink by up to 4.3 % , the steepest drop since independence in 1956 , because of the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak . 
" The situation is relatively under control , but more caution is required , " Fakhfakh told state run TV . 
He added that the pace of normal life will not return quickly even after 4 May . Tunisia ’s vital tourism sector could lose $ 1.4 billion and 400,000 jobs this year , an official letter sent to the IMF showed . 
The North African country has confirmed 866 cases of the coronavirus and 37 people have died , according to Reuters .
