Peru suspended flights from Europe for two weeks and has put its health and travel authorities on high alert to prevent the entry of a new strain of coronavirus that appeared in the UK , the president Francisco Sagasti said on Monday . 
Sagasti said no direct flights from the UK had entered the country since 15 December , when flights from Europe restarted . 
But health authorities were monitoring passengers from Britain who had entered through connecting flights , he said . 
A new and more easily transmissible strain of the coronavirus has led to surging infection numbers in London and east and south east England , prompting countries worldwide to suspend flights to and from the UK . 
The announcement comes as hard hit Peru nears 1m cases of Covid 19 , amid growing concerns over a second wave of the virus following the end of year holidays . 
Health officials in Peru have prohibited the use of private vehicles on 24 , 25 and 31 December , as well as on New Year ’s Day to reduce movement , and have discouraged Peruvians from visiting family over the holidays . 
In addition , Peru prohibited the entry of non resident foreigners who had been in the UK in the last two weeks . 
Peruvians or non residents already in the country who had recently visited the UK will be required to spend 14 days in isolation . 
Coronavirus cases in Peru hit 997,517 on Sunday , with 37,103 deaths from the disease , according to official figures . 
Peru has already signed a preliminary agreement with Pfizer to buy 9.9m doses of its vaccine , and inked a firm deal with the Covax Facility , an alliance led by the World Health Organization , to acquire another 13.2m doses . 
Sagasti ’s government said last week it did not know when the first doses would be arriving in the Andean nation , nor how many would be included in the first shipment .
