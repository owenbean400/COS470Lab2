Good afternoon , I â€™m Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog while Damien has lunch . 
According to a recent update from Public Health England , of the 73 UK tests that have been carried out , 73 were confirmed negative and none positive . 
The health body notes : The risk to the UK population has been assessed as low . 
This has been raised from very low due to current evidence on the ability for the virus to spread between people .
