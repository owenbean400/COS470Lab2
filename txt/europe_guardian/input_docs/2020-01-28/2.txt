A German man who tested positive for the strain of coronavirus sweeping across China was infected by a work colleague , officials said on Tuesday , in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe , AFP reports . 
The man had not visited China but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had started to feel sick on the flight home on 23 January , said Andreas Zapf , the head of the Bavarian state office for health and food safety . 
He had attended a training session given by his Chinese colleague on 21 January at the office of a car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria and tested positive for the virus on Monday evening . 
Unlike the other patients , the 33 year old had not recently travelled to China . 
He remains in hospital in an isolation ward , but Zapf said he " was doing well " . 
The Chinese woman immediately sought medical attention on her return to China and was confirmed to have caught the virus , which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the city of Wuhan . 
The woman had recently returned from visiting her parents in the Wuhan region , Zapf said . 
In a statement , the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China " for at least the next two weeks " . 
Health officials are checking 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently , including colleagues and family members .
