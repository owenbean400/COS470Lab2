Fewer than one in a hundred children who test positive for Covid 19 end up dying although a small but significant percentage develop severe illness , according to a new Europe wide study . 
A team of researchers led by experts in Britain , Austria and Spain looked at the outcomes of nearly 600 children under 18 infected with coronavirus and found that only a quarter had pre existing medical conditions . 
This is in sharp contrast to adults , among whom the vast majority of patients have underlying health problems . 
The team found that more than 60 % of children with the virus required hospital treatment and that 8 % needed intensive care . 
Of the 582 children studied , four died . 
On the other hand , more than 90 children , or 16 % , showed no symptoms at all . 
Marc Tebruegge , from University College London â€™s Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health , said : " The case fatality cohort was very low and it is likely to be substantially lower still , given many children with mild disease would not have been brought to medical attention and therefore not included in this study . 
" Overall , the vast majority of children and young people experience only mild disease , " added Tebruegge , lead author of the study published in The Lancet Child & amp ; 
Adolescent Health journal . 
" Nevertheless a notable number of children do develop severe disease and require intensive care support , and this should be accounted for when planning and prioritising healthcare resources as the pandemic progresses . "
