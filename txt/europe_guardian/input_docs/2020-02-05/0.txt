Sean , who did not want to give his last name , said it was " incredibly eerie in Beijing today " . 
The 34 year old manager of an English language school said there was heavy snow and few people on the street . 
" I worked from a cafe today , and was the only one inside . " 
He described the Foreign Office ’s advice to ‘ leave China ’ last night as " a huge over reaction and disregard for expats that actually live here and call China their home " . 
Sean added : " It ’s not simply a matter of hopping on a plane , it ’s a huge undertaking . 
It seemed to be a decision disconnected from the reality . " 
He pointed out that Beijing is thousands of kilometres from Hubei , the epicentre of the outbreak . 
" It seems strange to refer to China as a whole , we are talking about a country almost the size of Europe , and to evacuate the entire territory seems a bit much , " Sean said .
