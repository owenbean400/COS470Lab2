The Spanish government agreed with regional authorities on Wednesday that a maximum of 10 people per household will be allowed to gather for the Christmas and New Year holidays to avoid spreading the coronavirus , the health minister Salvador Illa said . 
The agreement , which applies to celebrations on Christmas Eve , Christmas , New Year ’s Eve and on New Year ’s Day , means a slight relaxation of the current general rule that allows gatherings of up to six people , except in some regions that have defined their own limits . 
The start of the night time curfews in force in most Spanish regions would be moved to 1:30am from 11pm on 24 and 31 December . 
Still , movement of people between regions will be banned , with some exceptions , between 23 December and 6 January , Illa told a news conference , adding that although the latest infection data inspired some optimism , prudence was paramount . 
To sum it up , this Christmas we stay at home ... 
It is desirable that people restrict their mobility and social contacts as much as possible . 
Governments across Europe are trying to navigate between avoiding spreading the virus over the holiday season and allowing people to celebrate with family and friends . 
The 10 person limit includes children , and the official recommendation is for people from the same household to celebrate together without outside guests . 
Spain imposed a six month state of emergency in October , giving regions legal backing to impose curfews and other restrictions . 
While the rate of infection in the country has slowed since , its overall tally of over 1.66m Covid 19 cases is among the highest in western Europe . 
The death toll reached 45,784 on Wednesday .
