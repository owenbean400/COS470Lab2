An outbreak of coronavirus cases at a meat processer in northern England owned by British supermarket Asda has caused the plant to close temporarily , the Walmart owned retailer said on Friday . 
Asda said it had been working with public health authorities to ensure staff were tested , and that while the factory in Cleckheaton , West Yorkshire had not been forced to shut , it had been closed as a precaution . 
It did not confirm how many cases had been found . 
A joint statement by Asda and Kober Limited , the firm which runs the plant , said : As soon as we became aware that some colleagues at our Kober site may have Covid 19 , we responded swiftly and worked collaboratively with the local authority and Public Health England to test all colleagues . 
The closure is the latest in a series of outbreaks linked to meat processing plants across Europe and the Americas . 
On Thursday , one of Britain â€™s biggest food companies suspended production after more than 50 positive tests . 
British trade union Unite said it had received reports of five more suspected outbreaks at different meat processing factories , without providing further details . 
The union said employers had to do more to protect their staff , while academic experts outlined risks of working in a factory environment .
