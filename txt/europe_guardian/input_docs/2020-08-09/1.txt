Despite international tourism facing its worst crisis since records began , Saudi Arabia has agreed with Europe ’s biggest hotel group Accor for the group to expand and operate a resort at the $ 20 billion Al Ula tourism project in the kingdom ’s northwestern region , the Royal Commission for the project said on Sunday . 
Al Ula , the site of an ancient civilisation in a remote northwestern corner of the country , is part of plans by the world ’s top crude exporter to diversify its economy away from oil and open up after decades of seclusion , Reuters reports . 
The agreement will see Accor operate an expanded Ashar Resort under the Banyan Tree brand , with 47 new units bringing the resort ’s total capacity to 82 high end villas , along with a spa and several gourmet restaurants , a commission statement said . 
The project is located in the Ashar valley , 15 km ( 9 miles ) from the Kingdom ’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site , Hegra . 
In April , Saudi Arabia ’s tourism minister said the sector could see a 35-45 % decline this year due to measures taken by the government to fight the coronavirus pandemic . 
The ultra conservative Muslim kingdom , relatively closed off for decades , has in recent years relaxed strict social codes such as the segregation of men and women in public and the requirement that women wear all covering black robes , or abayas . 
Al Ula ’s development is part of a push to preserve pre Islamic heritage sites in order to attract non Muslim tourists and strengthen national identity . 
It plans an official opening to the world as a year round destination in October 2020 . 
The kingdom closed its borders to foreign " umrah " pilgrims and to tourists from at least 25 countries in late February . 
In March , it barred all travel in and out of the country . 
Saudi Arabia has reported 287,262 cases of Covid 19 , the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus , and 3,130 deaths so far .
