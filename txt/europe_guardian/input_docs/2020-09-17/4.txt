Gambia ’s economic growth rate may fall to 2 % in 2020 versus a forecast 6 % due to the coronavirus pandemic , the president Adama Barrow said on Thursday , as he relaxed a nighttime curfew but kept other lockdown restrictions in place . 
The gross domestic product of mainland Africa ’s smallest country grew 6 % in 2019 despite a sharp drop in agricultural output and the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook , the travel operator that brought around 40 % of annual visitors . 
Its economy , however , has not been able to weather the fallout from the global pandemic , which led authorities to ban public gatherings among a string of lockdown measures imposed after they declared a state of emergency in March . 
" Based on the current situation , an estimated 20 % of expected revenue will be lost , " Barrow said in a speech to the nation . 
Gambia ’s forecast drop in growth is in line with other countries in sub Saharan Africa , whose combined gross domestic product was seen shrinking by 1.6 % this year - its worst performance on record , according to an April forecast from the International Monetary Fund . 
With the state of emergency expiring at midnight on Thursday , Barrow said the dawn to dusk curfew would be relaxed and shops , supermarkets and non essential vendors would be allowed to resume normal business hours . 
But non essential public places must remain closed and public gatherings are still banned . 
Over 52,000 people , or 2.6 % , of Gambia ’s 2 million population , have lost their jobs as a result of the lockdown , Barrow said . 
Gambia has reported 3,473 cases since the outbreak in March , and 107 deaths . 
The daily reported cases were relatively low until mid July .
