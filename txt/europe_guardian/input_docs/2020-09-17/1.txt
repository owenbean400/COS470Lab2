Here is some more detail on the earlier announcement that private indoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people in Austria from Monday as the country tries to contain a rising rate of infection . 
AFP reports that the chancellor , Sebastian Kurz , told a press conference the country was going through a second wave of the pandemic : From midnight on Monday ... all parties , private events and meetings indoors are limited to 10 people . 
We have an exponential rise in new infections in Austria . 
Funerals will be exempt from the new rules and the limit for outdoors will remain at 100 , Kurz said , with further exemptions for some cultural events . 
He said it would not be legally possible to enforce the new limit in people ’s homes but added that he hoped Austrians would follow the rule . 
Also from Monday , cafe and restaurant customers will have to wear a mask whenever they ’re not at their tables . 
Previously only waiters and other staff were required to wear a face covering . 
Austria is recording several hundred new daily infections , with the one day total reaching 882 on 11 September , the second highest of the whole crisis . 
Kurz said he was aware the measures " will once again mean sacrifices " from the population but they were necessary " to hopefully prevent a second lockdown " and the " catastrophic consequences " that would entail . 
Asked whether Vienna ’s famous winter ball season could go ahead , Kurz said it was too early to say but said " autumn and winter will be very hard " , adding : We expect a clear improvement next year in terms of progress with vaccines and treatments .
