Slovakia ’s pilot testing in coronavirus hotspots attracted tens of thousands people over the weekend , showing an infection rate of 3.87 % , government data showed on Sunday . 
The government plans to widen the scope to the whole country next weekend and hopes the antigen tests , along with a partial lockdown , can help curbing a sharp rise in infections , Reuters reports . 
Slovakia ’s testing campaign to cover most of its population and its results will likely draw the attention of other countries , including the neighbouring Czech Republic , which has been struggling with Europe ’s fastest surge of the epidemic . 
As of 5pm local time on Sunday , health workers had done 136,904 tests with 5,298 positive results , the government ’s website showed . 
The tests were administered between Friday and Sunday at around 235 sites in four northern regions that are home to about 180,000 people . 
In some locations , many people even showed up who live outside the designated regions , local media reported . 
" Thanks to the effort of all the involved staff and the responsibility of people who participated , the pilot phase of the country wide testing has proven successful , " prime minister Igor Matovic ’s party OLANO said . 
The government offered an incentive to take part in the tests , offering less stringent rules to those with negative results , while those not participating face a stricter lockdown regime including a ban on commuting to work . 
President Zuzana Caputova has questioned the idea of sanctions slapped on those not participating in tests declared as voluntary . 
In the regular tests done since the pandemic started , Slovakia reported a record 3,042 new cases of the coronavirus on Sunday , bringing the total number of infections to 43,843 .
