Trump has said his administration will soon release a plan to help US oil companies , which the treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said could include adding millions of barrels of oil to already teeming national reserves . 
We ’re also exploring potentially having the ability to store another several hundred million barrels , so we ’re looking at lots of different options . 
And , as oil producing nations try to deal with the pandemic driven fall in prices , Norway has agreed to slash its output from June to December , marking the first time in 18 years western Europe ’s principal producer of oil has joined up with other major nations to shore up prices . 
Its oil minister Tina Bru has said : We will cut Norwegian production by 250,000 barrels per day in June and by 134,000 barrels per day in the second half of 2020 . 
In addition , the start up of production of several fields will be delayed until 2021 . 
Consequently , the total Norwegian production in December 2020 will be 300,000 barrels less per day than originally planned by the companies . 
The regulation will cease by the end of the year .
