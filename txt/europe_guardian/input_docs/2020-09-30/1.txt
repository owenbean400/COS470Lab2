British health experts have admitted Covid 19 is out of control in the country as case numbers and hospital admissions rise despite a slew of new restrictions on social gatherings . 
" Things are definitely heading in the wrong direction , " the UK chief scientific adviser , Patrick Vallance , told a government press conference , as a further 7,108 cases and 71 deaths were reported . 
As England â€™s chief medical officer , Chris Whitty , warned that hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care were also rising , Vallance added : " We do not have this under control at the moment . " 
More than 42,000 people have died from Covid 19 in Britain , the worst toll in Europe , despite a nationwide stay at home imposed in late March . 
The lockdown was eased in June but authorities have in recent weeks reimposed restrictions on social gatherings , including early closing for pubs and a ban on groups of more than six . 
Standing alongside Vallance and Whitty , prime minister Boris Johnson said it was " still too early to tell " if these measures would have an effect , and urged people to follow the rules . 
" If we put in the work together now then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures , " he said .
