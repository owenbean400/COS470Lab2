Cumbrian police have warned Scots not to cross the border on Saturday to watch the Old Firm match in bars and pubs there after several bars and pubs were contacted by Scottish football fans hoping to visit . 
Celtic and Rangers supporters and venues have been warned ahead of the match that the rule of six will be strictly enforced by Cumbria Police . 
Pubs , bars and restaurants across central Scotland are closed for a two week period , while those elsewhere in Scotland can only serve alcohol outdoors until the 10pm curfew . 
Superintendent Matt Kennerley said : We understand restrictions on licensed premises in Scotland might offer the temptation to travel south of the border to visit our pubs and bars - but anybody breaching rules here does face a fine . 
He highlighted Scottish government advice which says people should not travel outside their local health board area .
