Brazil overtook Russia on Friday in terms of the number of coronavirus cases , Reuters reports , having registered 330,890 people who have contracted the virus – second only to the United States . 
Brazil registered 1,001 daily coronavirus deaths on Friday , taking the total deaths to 21,048 , according to the health ministry . 
However , the true numbers – both of cases and deaths – is probably higher as Latin America ’s top economy has been slow to ramp up testing . 
Meanwhile Brazil ’s environment minister , Ricardo Salles , called on the government to push through further deregulation of environmental policy while people are distracted by the coronavirus pandemic , in a video the supreme court ordered to be released . 
The video of a ministers ’ meeting surfaced in an investigation of whether the president , Jair Bolsonaro , interfered in appointing leaders of the federal police for personal gain . 
During the meeting , other ministers spoke , including Salles , with environmental groups saying his remarks prove that the Bolsonaro government is systematically seeking to dismantle environmental protections . 
" We need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage , because they are only talking about Covid , and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms , " Salles said in the video . 
Deforestation hit an 11 year high last year and has increased 55 % in the first four months of the year , compared with a year ago , with environmentalists blaming Bolsonaro ’s policies .
