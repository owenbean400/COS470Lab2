In Australia , travellers from regional NSW are now able to go to Queensland for the first time in almost four months but Sydneysiders are still not welcome in the Sunshine State . 
Travel restrictions eased at 1am on Tuesday ( Australia time ) , with the Queensland border flung open to everyone except those in greater Sydney and Victoria . 
The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is irate that Sydney residents are banned , arguing the bar Queensland has set for resuming free travel between the states is too high . 
Meanwhile , Berejiklian has indicated a reopening of the NSW border with Victoria could happen soon . 
We â€™re talking weeks not months in terms of when the Victorian border may come down , but that again is based on health advice , " she told reporters on Monday . 
" I would not be surprised if we moved more quickly against Victoria than Queensland did against us . " 
When asked if an announcement would be made this week , Berejiklian said " potentially , yes " .
