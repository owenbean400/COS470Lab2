The Labour party in England has called for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to engage in cross party talks to produce a six month economic support plan to guide the country through coronavirus . 
Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the Treasury should " stop the last minute scramble " and combine with opposition leaders , businesses and unions to draw up a long term strategy . 
Dodds has written to her Government counterpart after he announced on Saturday that , to coincide with the second national lockdown for England , the furlough scheme would continue in its current form , paying 80 % of employees â€™ wages for hours not worked , up to a maximum of 2,500 per month . 
In her letter to Sunak , she said the announcement " just hours before " the initial furlough scheme was due to end was " symptomatic " of what she said appeared to be a " lack of any strategic planning by the Government to support jobs and businesses " .
