The Culture Secretary in England has confirmed arts venues can remain open for rehearsals during the country â€™s lockdown . 
Oliver Dowden said while audiences will not be able to attend the venues they are " places of work " and will therefore be able to remain open . 
Footage of performances taking place inside venues will also be permitted to be streamed online when tougher restrictions come into force in England , he confirmed on Twitter . 
" Arts venues are places of work , so people can come into them for work , if it cannot be undertaken from home , " he wrote . 
" This includes rehearsals and performance . 
Audiences are not permitted . " 
A number of productions , including Les Miserables in the West End and a panto at the London Palladium , are due to return to the stage with socially distanced audiences over the festive period .
