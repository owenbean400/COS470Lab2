Russia has applied to the World Health Organization for accelerated registration and pre qualification of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine , the country ’s sovereign wealth fund said . 
Russia announced in August that it had registered the world ’s first coronavirus vaccine , named after the Soviet era satellite . 
On Tuesday , the Russian Direct Investment Fund , which finances the vaccine , said that accelerated registration would make Sputnik V " available globally in a shorter time frame than usual procedures " . 
" The Russian Federation has become one of the first countries to apply to WHO for pre qualification of its vaccine against the novel coronavirus infection , " RDIF said in a statement . 
When contacted by news agency AFP , the WHO said such requests were " confidential " . 
According to the Russian statement , " successful pre qualification will enable Sputnik V to be included in the list of medicines used by international procurement agencies and countries to guide bulk purchasing of medicines " . 
Some Western scientists have expressed concern over the Russian vaccine , warning that moving too quickly could be dangerous . 
So far , the WHO said , it " has not yet pre qualified a vaccine for Covid 19 , nor published any emergency use listing " .
