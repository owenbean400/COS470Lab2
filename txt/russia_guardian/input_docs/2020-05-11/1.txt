Energy demand has plummeted during the Covid 19 crisis and global carbon dioxide emissions are anticipated to be 8 % lower this year , compared with 2019 . 
Is this affecting our weather and will it affect the global climate in years to come ? 
Carbon dioxide hangs around in the atmosphere for decades so it takes a long time for the impact to play out . 
Keith Shine , an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading , estimates the Covid 19 effect might reduce warming by a measly 0.0025C in about 20 years time . 
This is far below anything we can observe . 
If we were to sustain this 8 % reduction over the coming years , Shine calculated , we would avoid about 0.15C of warming but , sadly , we would still massively overshoot our Paris agreement target of 1.5C . 
This emphasises the scale of the task we have ahead of us .
