Thousands of Russia linked social media accounts are attempting to spread panic about the coronavirus outbreak , US officials said . 
They said the disinformation campaign promoted unfounded conspiracy theories that the US was behind the outbreak , in an apparent attempt to damage its international standing . 
False personas are being used on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points and conspiracies , including suggesting that the CIA is behind the virus that has claimed more than 2,300 lives , mostly in China . 
Philip Reeker , the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia , said : Russia â€™s intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within , including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns . 
By spreading disinformation about coronavirus , Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response .
