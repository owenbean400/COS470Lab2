Portugal ’s president on Friday declared a state of health emergency that will come into force next week to allow the government to impose further coronavirus restrictions . 
In a televised appearance , Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said he had just signed a decree " relating to a second state of emergency " since the start of the pandemic that will last at least two weeks . 
It will be " very limited and largely preventative " but " paves the way for new measures such as restricting traffic to certain times and certain days , in highest risk municipalities , " he said . 
The government will hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Saturday to decide what type of measures to introduce . 
These could include a nighttime curfew similar to what has been implemented in other European nations , or taking people ’s temperature at some locations . 
During the first wave of the pandemic in the spring , Portuguese authorities decreed a six week state of emergency . 
Some 7.1 million people are currently living under new restrictions and have been asked to stay home and work remotely as far as possible . 
But unlike the first spring lockdown , schools remain open , along with shops and restaurants , though they have to close earlier . 
Since the start of the pandemic , Portugal has reported close to 167,000 cases and more than 2,700 deaths .
