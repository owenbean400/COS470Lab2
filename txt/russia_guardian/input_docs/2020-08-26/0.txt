The rapid pace of Covid 19 vaccine development and scant information about the US Food and Drug Administration ’s ( FDA ) vaccine review process are leading to concerns , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) said . 
In a letter , the AMA urged the FDA to ensure transparency in the vaccine development process and keep physicians informed of the agency ’s plan for review of potential vaccine candidates . 
Vaccine hesitancy among the public appears to be reaching unprecedented levels due to a number of factors including significant spread of misinformation through channels such as social media , according to the AMA . 
In April , the US government initiated Operation Warp Speed and has so far invested billions to secure doses of potential vaccines from across the world . 
Warp Speed aims to expedite development of a vaccine and therapies to treat Covid 19 , and the emphasis on speed has provoked public anxiety about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines . 
Earlier this month , Russia became the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid 19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing . 
However , experts have warned against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken . 
In August , top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said the FDA was not cutting corners on safety in its review of vaccine candidates for Covid 19 .
