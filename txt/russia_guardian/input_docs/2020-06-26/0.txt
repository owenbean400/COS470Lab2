My colleague in the US , Sam Levin , has this update . 
Most US residents will likely be blocked from travelling to the European Union when travel restarts , due to ongoing concerns about the coronavirus , according to multiple reports . 
EU officials are in the process of settling on a final " safe list " of countries whose residents could travel to the block in July , but the US , Brazil and Russia are set to be excluded , Reuters reported . 
With coronavirus continuing to spread in the US at alarming rates , the possibility of allowing American tourists into the EU is not even part of the ongoing discussion , six diplomats familiar with the talks told the Washington Post . 
The list of allowed countries includes China , but on the condition that China allows EU travellers to visit , the New York Times reported . 
Various travel restrictions remain across the globe . 
Greece , for example , requires Covid tests for arrivals from a number of EU countries , including France , Italy , the Netherlands and Spain . 
Self isolation is also mandatory until results come in .
