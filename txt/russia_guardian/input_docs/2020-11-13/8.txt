Western Australia â€™s premier , Mark Mc Gowan , said on Friday his state was ready to take the " next big step forward " in its handling of the coronavirus . 
On Saturday morning , the state took that step with the hard border closure lifted . 
The ABC reported earlier this morning that 150 people had already crossed the border since midnight , with police taking two to three minutes to check and clear each vehicle at border checks . 
Arrivals from NSW and Victoria will still need to self quarantine for 14 days but other domestic arrivals are free to enter . 
The prime minister , Scott Morrison , announced yesterday that the current plan was to have all state and territory borders open for Christmas , except WA .
