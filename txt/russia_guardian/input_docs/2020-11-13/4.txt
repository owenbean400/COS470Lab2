Canadians have time to contain the surging second wave of Covid 19 by Christmas if they act now , the prime minister , Justin Trudeau , said on Friday . 
Reuters reports that he urged provincial leaders for the second time this week to impose more health restrictions . 
" What we do in the coming days and weeks will determine what we get to do at Christmas , " Trudeau said at a news conference . 
In Canada , new cases averaged 4,300 per day during the past week , with around 55 deaths a day . 
If the coronavirus continues to spread at this pace , Canada will be recording more than 10,000 new cases per day by early December , the chief medical officer Theresa Tam said . 
Some Canadian hospitals are already filling up , she added . 
Apart from the Atlantic provinces , where borders are closed to visitors from elsewhere in Canada and abroad , cases are rising across the country . 
" Provinces need to make the right decisions around bringing in rules that will limit close contacts , limit the spread of Covid 19 , " Trudeau said , three days after first urging premiers , who are in charge of health restrictions , to act . 
Saskatchewan on Friday restricted alcohol sales after 10 pm and widened mask mandates to cover indoor public spaces in all communities with more than 5,000 residents . 
The province also said larger high schools should consider reducing in class learning . 
People in the hardest hit areas of Ontario should stay home and avoid all social gatherings , Premier Doug Ford said in a news conference . 
However , restaurants and gyms remain open to a limited number of patrons even in those hotspots . 
More health restrictions may come next week , Ford said .
