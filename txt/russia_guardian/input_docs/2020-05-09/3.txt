A child was among 16 migrants rescued four miles off the coast of France when their makeshift vessel bound for Britain ran into difficulties in the middle of the night , authorities said . 
The group was picked up 3.8 miles off the French port of Calais after calling for help , French maritime authorities confirmed to AFP . 
A French maritime surveillance vessel rescued the migrants at around 5am and transported them to the Channel port of Dunkirk , where they were handed over to border police . 
A charity leader said last month that migrants living in makeshift camps in northern France are dangerously exposed to Covid 19 , warning that conditions were " the worst I â€™ve ever seen " .
