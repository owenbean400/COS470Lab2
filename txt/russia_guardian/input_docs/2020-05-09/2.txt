Vladimir Putin has told Russians they are invincible when they stand together , as he sought to send a message of unity after the country ’s tally of Covid 19 cases reached the fifth highest in the world . 
Addressing the nation in a speech as he presided over Victory Day celebrations , a sombre Putin invoked the memory of the country ’s veterans who fought in the second world war . 
" Our veterans fought for life and against death , and we will always try to live up to their spirit of unanimity and resilience , " he said after laying a bouquet of red roses at the Eternal Flame war memorial near the Kremlin . 
We are united by our shared memory , hopes and aspirations , as well as a sense of shared responsibility for the present and the future . 
We know and strongly believe that when we stand together , we are invincible . " 
It comes after Russia ’s total confirmed infections neared 200,000 . 
Victory Day , marking the defeat of Nazi Germany , is one of Russia ’s most revered public events and provides Putin with a platform to promote the patriotism that is a cornerstone of his popular support . 
But the pandemic forced him to postpone the main highlight , a huge annual parade on Moscow ’s Red Square showcasing Moscow ’s most sophisticated military hardware . 
In his first public appearance for weeks , Putin took part in a low key remembrance ceremony , but he made clear he still planned to hold the usual parade to mark the anniversary when the time was right .
