Nigeria ’s largest city Lagos could return to lockdown to halt the coronavirus if residents continue to ignore social distancing rules , the governor warned on Saturday . 
The city emerged on Monday from a five week stay at home order that left the city ’s large number of poor struggling to make ends meet . 
But since the easing of the restrictions people have been seen thronging markets and banks despite orders remaining in place to avoid mass gatherings . 
" It is disappointing to see the crowd at banks and markets across the state flouting the guidelines , " Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo Olu wrote on Twitter . 
Lagos , We are at a critical point in the management of the # COVID19 pandemic in our state and every resident needs to # Take Responsibility for their health and wellbeing . 
" We will be forced to take the painful decision of bringing the state under lockdown if it remains clear that Lagosians are determined to flout the rules . " 
Nigeria has confirmed 3,912 infections and 117 deaths from the novel coronavirus . 
Lagos , a city of some 20 million people , has been the country ’s main hotspot and the daily increase in recorded cases has doubled in the past few days . 
Sanwo Olu said that Lagos state would change its " isolation strategy " and that district healthcare facilities would handle " mild to moderate " cases . 
Half of Nigeria ’s 200 million population live in dire poverty , making it a major challenge to impose lockdowns cutting them off from daily earnings . 
Measures introduced in place of the total lockdown include a night time curfew and the mandatory wearing of masks in public .
