Three children in New York have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the coronavirus , governor Andrew Cuomo told a daily briefing on Saturday . 
Cuomo had on Friday disclosed the death of a five year old linked to the coronavirus and a syndrome that shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease , which was the first known fatality tied to the rare illness in New York . 
The governor told a daily briefing on Saturday that the illness had now taken the lives of at least three young people across the state . 
He did not provide details of their ages or the circumstances of their deaths . 
But Cuomo said he was increasingly worried that the syndrome posed a newly emerging risk for children , who had previously been thought to be largely immune to severe illness from Covid 19 , the respiratory disease caused by the virus .
