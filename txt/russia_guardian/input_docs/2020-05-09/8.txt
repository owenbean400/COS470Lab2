At least 12 Russian clerics have died since the start of the coronavirus outbreak , according to a list published by " Orthodoxy and the World " , an online media outlet that focuses on religious and social issues . 
Father Andrei Molchanov , the latest Russian Orthodox priest to die from the novel coronavirus , was buried on Saturday by his heartbroken daughter who said she wished the Moscow church where he served had closed earlier . 
Patriarch Kirill , the head of the Russian Orthodox Church , called in late March for believers to pray at home . 
However tough government lockdown measures at the end of that month , which closed down restaurants and most stores , and told people to stay at home , did not order churches to shut . 
" I believe above all else that we should have closed churches , along with restaurants and other places , " Anastasia Molchanova , the late priest ’s daughter , told Reuters after his burial . 
Despite the patriarch ’s call , most churches in Moscow , including Molchanov ’s , remained open until mid April before Russia ’s consumer health watchdog , a government agency , issued an order to shut them . 
The consumer health watchdog and the Russian Orthodox Church did not immediately respond to requests for comment , according to Reuters .
