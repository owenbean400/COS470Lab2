We often report news from Sweden , which as a country which has not imposed mandatory measures to curb the spread of coronavirus is a subject of intense interest for those following the outbreak ’s spread around the world . 
However , little is said about another European country that has done even less to respond to the outbreak . 
Belarus - labelled " Europe ’s last dictatorship " by some observers - has made almost no changes to adapt to the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Belarus has stood out for its lack of official response since the start of the pandemic , with Alexander Lukashenko , who has been president since 1995 , repeatedly disputing the seriousness of the virus . 
The country has ignored insistent calls from the World Health Organisation to implement social distancing and ban mass events , holding a large military parade in the capital Minsk , on 9 May . Presidential elections are scheduled for 9 August and candidates are campaigning as normal . 
On Friday , the health ministry reported 906 new confirmed cases of coronavirus , taking the total in the country of 9.5 million to 40,765 , according to Russia ’s Tass news agency . 
The daily death toll was five on Friday , down from a peak of seven on 12 May , adding to an official total of 224 since the outbreak began . 
Earlier this week , AFP , the French news agency , reported that volunteer groups in the countries had stepped in to bring supplies of protective equipment to hospitals . 
Its reporter met a group called By Covid1 , who were taking sacks of protective suits and face masks , funded by donations , to a hospital in the small town of Chervyen , about 40 miles west of the capital Minsk . 
One of the coordinators , Andrei Tkachev , told AFP the true scale of the outbreak could be much higher . 
" Unfortunately the statistics from the hospitals are very depressing . 
And they are different from what is published officially : they are much worse , " he said .
