Preliminary results from the late stage human trial of Russia ’s main coronavirus vaccine candidate could include data from 5,000-10,000 participants , Denis Logunov , a director at the Gamaleya Institute that developed the vaccine , said . 
Russia ’s plan to publish preliminary data about the Sputnik V jab as early as November is likely to make it one of the first vaccine developers to share any data from a final stage trial , known as Phase III , but also puts it at odds with competitors . 
The Sputnik V trial , involving 40,000 volunteers , has been underway in Moscow since the beginning of September . 
Interim results , when published , will be based on the first 42 days of monitoring participants , Gamaleya developers told Reuters last month . 
To meet a November target , the interim results will have to be based on a limited data set - between 5,000 and 10,000 people - due to logistical challenges . 
Two dozen clinics in Moscow have been racing to administer the vaccine to volunteers , but only around 16,000 people have received the first dose of the two shot jab so far . 
There is then a 21 day wait until the second dose can be administered . 
Setting a target timeframe for publishing interim results is unusual . 
Many Western vaccine developers have said the publication of interim results depends on how many volunteers report becoming infected with coronavirus , thereby allowing the placebo and vaccine groups to be compared . 
A date for when this threshold is met cannot be set in advance . 
Russia has been pushing ahead with its potential coronavirus vaccine at full speed , licensing it for domestic use before large scale trials had even begun . 
It is also marketing the shot abroad . 
Interim Phase III results may be useful for foreign regulators deciding whether to procure supplies of Sputnik V or authorise local trials of the jab .
