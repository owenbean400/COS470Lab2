The US has accused China and Russia of increasing cooperation to spread false narratives about the coronavirus pandemic , AFP are reporting . 
Lea Gabrielle , coordinator of the State Department ’s global engagement centre , which tracks foreign propaganda , said Beijing was increasingly adopting techniques honed by Moscow . 
" Even before the Covid 19 crisis , we assessed a certain level of coordination between Russia and the PRC in the realm of propaganda , " Gabrielle told reporters . 
" But with this pandemic the cooperation has accelerated rapidly . 
" We see this convergence as a result of what we consider to be pragmatism between the two actors who want to shape public understanding of the Covid pandemic for their own purposes . " 
The global engagement centre said earlier that thousands of Russian linked social media accounts were spreading conspiracies about the pandemic , including notions that the virus , detected in Wuhan , China , was created by the United States . 
Tensions have increased recently , as the secretary of state , Mike Pompeo , persisted with allegations that coronavirus originated in a Wuhan laboratory – despite the WHO and the US government ’s own top epidemiologist saying there was no evidence the virus came from a lab . 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed cooperation over the pandemic in a phonecall with the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , on Friday . 
Putin told him that Russia " opposes the attempts by some forces to use the epidemic as a pretext to blame China and will stand firmly by China ’s side " , according to China ’s state run Xinhua news agency .
