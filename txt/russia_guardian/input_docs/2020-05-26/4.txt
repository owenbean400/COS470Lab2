Brazilian nurse Rusia Goes gave birth while unconscious and breathing through a ventilator tube in April as she suffered severe Covid 19 symptoms . 
It would be nearly a month before the 42 year old was reunited with her newborn daughter . 
She has told Reuters : Only God knows how much I missed that little one , who had been inside me , and all of a sudden was taken out because of all of this . 
Goes is one of at least 374,000 Brazilians infected by the virus , now the world ’s second biggest outbreak after the United States . 
Over 23,000 people have died . 
While she normally works as a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit , Goes stayed home once the pandemic started . 
But her husband Ednaldo Goes suspects he may have transmitted the virus to her as he continued to go out to work and shop for the family . 
When Rusia Goes checked into a Rio de Janeiro hospital with shortness of breath and other Covid 19 symptoms , she was just beginning the eighth month of her pregnancy . 
Doctors recommended a premature birth by cesarean section to better treat the mother ’s condition . 
The baby tested negative for the virus and was isolated from Goes , who was transferred to another hospital as her condition worsened . 
She said the battle with the respiratory disease was hard and " very painful , " but slowly she was able to recover . 
She first met her daughter Luisa virtually , via a video link to her husband and the baby in another hospital . 
Goes was finally released from the hospital after two weeks and first met her daughter in person on 20 May – some 26 days after giving birth . 
Masked medical staff gathered with balloons and applauded as Goes left the hospital with her baby in her arms . 
" To hold her to my chest was so emotional , " she said .
