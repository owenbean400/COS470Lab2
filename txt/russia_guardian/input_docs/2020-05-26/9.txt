In England , regional flare ups of coronavirus cases after rules are eased will be tackled with " local lockdowns " , the health secretary has said . 
Matt Hancock told the No 10 daily press briefing the ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions would be part of the NHS test , track and trace system , which is due to expand on 1 June . 
According to the government ’s road map for easing lockdown restrictions , this could lead to local schools , businesses or workplaces being closed in areas with high prevalence of infection . 
Hancock said : " We will have local lockdowns in future where there are flare ups and we have a system we are putting in place with a combination of Public Health England and the new joint biosecurity centre , along with the local directors of public health who play an absolutely crucial role in the decision making in the system , to make sure if there is a local flare up there is a local lockdown . 
" And so local lockdowns will be part of the future system that we put in place as part of the NHS test and trace system . " 
The government ’s road map for easing lockdown restrictions has set out how the joint biosecurity centre would have a " response function " that could address local spikes in infections , in partnership with local public health agencies , and impose restrictions .
