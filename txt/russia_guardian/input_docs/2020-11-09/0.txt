France ’s new Covid 19 infections were sharply down over 24 hours on Monday , as they always tend to be at the beginning of the week , but deaths and hospital admissions linked to the disease were sharply up again . 
Hospital admissions are closing in on the April record , Reuters reports . 
While the country ’s health director acknowledged that the main French cities put under curfew inmid October were starting to see a lesser spread of the disease , he stressed the peak of the coronavirus pandemic was still to come . 
" We are at a crucial moment , " Jérôme Salomon told a news conference , with France already more than 10 days in its second national lockdown aimed at reining in the virus . 
Salomon reported 20,155 daily new Covid 19 infections , sharply down from Saturday ’s record of 86,852 and Sunday ’s 38,619 . 
The Monday figure tends to dip as there are fewer tests conducted on Sundays . 
The seven day moving average of new infections , which averages out weekly data reporting irregularities , stood at 48,734 , the third highest on record . 
With 1,807,479 confirmed cases since the outbreak of the disease , France has the fourth highest tally in the world – it leapfrogged Russia over the weekend – behind the US , India and Brazil . 
The number of people who have died from Covid 19 rose by 551 to 40,987 , versus 270 on Sunday and a seven day moving average of 508 , a figure that is at a 28 week high . 
There were 882 more people treated in hospital for Covid 19 , taking the total to 31,125 , versus a seven day moving average of 856 . 
That means the 14 April record of 32,292 is bound to be overtaken in the coming days . 
The number of patients in intensive care units was up by 151 to 4,690 . 
For that indicator , the all time high is 7,148 , reached on 8 April .
