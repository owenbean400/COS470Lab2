Airbnb has announced it will offer frontline healthcare workers free places to stay during the coronavirus outbreak . 
The accommodation company announced it has teamed up with the NHS to create a global programme which aims to house 100,000 frontline healthcare staff fighting the coronavirus pandemic around the world . 
This will include healthcare professionals , relief workers and first responders . 
Homeowners who list their properties through Airbnb are able to opt in to the programme and offer an entire home , with Airbnb waiving all fees for the stays . 
So far , nearly 1,500 places to stay have been offered in the UK . 
Patrick Robinson , director of public policy at Airbnb , said : The entire country is behind our heroic NHS and medical staff as they battle the coronavirus outbreak . 
We have made it our priority to stand with the Airbnb community to do what we can to help . 
By working together , we can ensure that frontline workers can find a free and convenient place to stay as they continue their critical work . 
We thank our doctors and nurses across the country from the bottom of our hearts and are grateful to hosts who have already opened their homes during these difficult times . 
The initiative builds on programmes already launched in Italy and France where Airbnb and local partners , including the French Government , announced that doctors , nurses , care givers and other medical support staff who are responding to the outbreak in the country can access accommodation on Airbnb .
