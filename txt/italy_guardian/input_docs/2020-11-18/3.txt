Air France KLM is among the airlines gearing up for the challenge of transporting millions of doses of temperature sensitive Covid 19 vaccines in the midst of a travel slump . 
Breakthrough vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna have yet to win final approval , but the drugmakers , their logistics and cargo providers are not waiting for a green light to activate freight plans . 
" It ’s going to be a major logistics challenge , " said Air France cargo chief Christophe Boucher , citing the " massive " volume of vaccines to be distributed globally . 
" Another difficulty is the temperature control , " Boucher said in an interview at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport - where cargo specialists were preparing to load consignments of super cooled rabies vaccines bound for Brazil . 
The Covid 19 airlift is being planned amid a partial shutdown of global air travel . 
Airlines have warned that travel curbs could hamper the effort , since around 45 % of global cargo typically travels in passenger plane holds . 
Meanwhile , Pfizer Inc said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses of the vaccine in the first half of 2021 , amid evidence the coronavirus is spreading more rapidly in South America ’s largest country .
