Bolivia ’s cholita wrestlers are making a comeback to the ring after the iconic female fighters were forced to hang up their billowing skirts and bowler hats due to the Covid 19 pandemic , Reuters reports . 
The indigenous women wrestlers have become symbolic at home and abroad of the power of women , reclaiming the pejorative Spanish term " chola " used for indigenous groups and proudly making it part of their heritage and strength . 
Hit by the pandemic , the cholita wrestlers are now returning after a nine month hiatus , but face an ongoing challenge with the lucrative tourist crowd still missing from matches . 
" I will show that I am a good wrestler , and not just in the ring . 
I will also show that I have won against the pandemic , we will recover what we have lost , " said fighter Patricia Torres , who goes as " Gloria La Luchadora " in the ring . 
I ’ve been wrestling for about 10 years . 
I am a single mother of two children , and I have a trade . 
Because of the trade I am in , I am able to dedicate enough time to my children , to take them to school and to study . 
Torres said that the green light for wrestling to resume in late November was a blessing , as some spectators were able to return to the stands , even if the pandemic was far from over . 
" It ’s very beautiful to have the public here , who have come out to have a look at fighting cholitas , " she said . 
Before the pandemic , we were a part of the cultural heritage that was not recognised , tourists came from all over the world to see just us , the fighting cholita luchadores of wrestling .
