Christmas mass in Bethlehem , normally attended by Christian congregations in the West Bank village , will be closed to the public this year due to Covid 19 restrictions , the Palestinian president said Thursday . 
Each year , hundreds of believers attend midnight mass at the Saint Catherine Church next to the Church of the Nativity , built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born . 
" Due to the pandemic and for the security of all , the midnight mass will be reserved for clerics and the mass will be broadcast on Palestine TV worldwide , " Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said . 
He was speaking in an interview with church officials in Ramallah , seat of the Palestinian Authority . 
Days before , the PA imposed a new lockdown in several governorates in the Israeli occupied West Bank and extended a curfew in force in the evenings and weekends throughout the territory to combat a surge in novel coronavirus infections . 
Virus related restrictions meant the towering Christmas tree in Bethlehem was lit on 5 December without the usual crowds . 
Locals and pilgrims traditionally gather each year for the lighting of the tree in Manger Square , in front of the Church of the Nativity . 
The Palestinian health ministry has recorded more than 78,000 cases of Covid 19 , including 740 deaths in the West Bank , territory occupied by Israel since 1967 .
