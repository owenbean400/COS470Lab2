The Irsh Rugby Football Union ( IRFU ) is seeking an urgent meeting with the country ’s health minister as to why the Ireland vs Italy rugby match should be cancelled . 
Simon Harris has said the match should not go ahead on 7 March because of a coronavirus outbreak in northern Italy . 
The union has said : The IRFU is seeking an urgent meeting with Minister Harris as to the specific reasoning behind calling for the cancellation of the Ireland v Italy Six Nations fixture in the context of the government ’s overall travel policy to and from Italy and other affected countries . 
Until such time as the IRFU has had contact with the minister and gets an understanding of the government ’s strategic policy on travel to and from Ireland and the cancellation of mass gatherings , it is not in a position to comment further .
