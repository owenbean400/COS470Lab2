The restrictions in California call for bars , hair and nail salons and tattoo shops to close again . 
They have been ordered by Governor Gavin Newsom to take effect on a region by region basis as hospital intensive care unit beds reach capacity . 
As of 11:59pm on Sunday , the affected regions , including Southern California , were also required to shut down even outdoor restaurant dining .
