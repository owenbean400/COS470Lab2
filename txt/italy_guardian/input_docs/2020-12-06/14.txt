When website developer Nathalie Alpi heard England was going into another month long lockdown at the start of November , she was immediately worried for her friends running independent shops around Bristol . 
" I knew they would be missing all that footfall at one of the most important times of the year – and I just did not know how they would survive ’ , " she told the Guardian . 
Instead of wringing her hands , she and her husband took action – creating a virtual high street for independent traders , Shop Here Not There . 
" It ’s a gift to all of the small independent shops of Bristol , " she said . 
" It ’s not a business , it ’s really just there to help . "
