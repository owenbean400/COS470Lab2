Individual US states scrambled on Sunday to impose lockdowns to stem coronavirus spikes amid a lack of national leadership as cases , deaths and hospitalisations hit record levels across the country . 
Dr Deborah Birx , the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator , expressed frustration on Sunday over the mixed messages coming from the Trump administration that are reflected in some Americans â€™ perception about masks , social distancing and super spreader events . 
" Right now , across the Sun Belt , we have governors and mayors who have cases equivalent to what they had in the summertime yet are not putting in the same policies and mitigations that they put in the summer , that they know changed the course of this pandemic across the South , " she told NBC . 
" So it is frustrating because not only do we know what works , governors and mayors used those tools to stem the tide in the spring and the summer , " Birx said . 
Only about half of the 50 US states have enacted new restrictions during the resurgence of the last month . 
Fourteen states do not mandate masks .
