The UK government needs to provide " crystal clear " information about how prioritisation for the Covid 19 vaccine will work , a senior doctor has said . 
Vaccinations will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs from Tuesday with people aged 80 and over , care home workers and NHS workers who are at higher risk the first to receive the jab . 
The British Medical Association ( BMA ) said there has so far been " mixed messaging " about when higher risk people can expect to be vaccinated . 
BMA chair of council Dr Chaand Nagpaul said : " We need the government to be crystal clear about how this prioritisation will work ; we have already seen mixed messaging about when care homes , high risk patients in the community and NHS staff can expect to be vaccinated , and many will be disappointed that they will have to wait for several weeks longer than originally indicated by the government . 
" In the first phase of the pandemic , significant numbers of healthcare workers became seriously ill and many lost their lives to the virus â€“ and we need to prevent any more unnecessary deaths or enforced absences from work . "
