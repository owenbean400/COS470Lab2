Melbourne has welcomed its first international passenger flight in five months , an arrival that will test the state of Victoria ’s revamped hotel quarantine system . 
Australia has since March closed its borders to non citizens , but airports serving Victoria ’s capital stopped accepting any arrivals in late June after an outbreak of Covid 19 that began at two hotels where arrivals were quarantining . 
More than 20,000 infections were recorded in Victoria when hotel staff contracted the virus from people returning from overseas . 
The outbreak was chiefly blamed on failures of private contractors to follow protocols . 
Under the new quarantine system , arrivals will no longer be allowed to leave their hotel rooms . 
The system is similar to the model used in Sydney , which has accommodated thousands of people returning without any clusters emerging .
