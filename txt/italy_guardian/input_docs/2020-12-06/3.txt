Nottingham ’s Christmas market was shut down on Sunday after organisers faced criticism over the lack of social distancing . 
Pictures were shared online of the busy market showing large crowds gathered in Old Market Square on Saturday , with some raising concerns over the hundreds of people seemingly breaking the rules . 
How on earth is Nottingham Christmas Market allowed to go ahead like this , but hospitality venues still not allowed to open with sensible protocols in place ? 
On Sunday , the Mellors Group , which operates the Christmas market , said it had to temporarily close the attraction due to " unprecedented high footfall " . 
Nottinghamshire Police said officers were at the market all day to provide visible presence and to break up large crowds in the area . 
The city was placed in tier 3 – the toughest measures – of the new Covid 19 restrictions which came into force in England from Wednesday after the four week national lockdown ended .
