Italy ’s latest restrictions to try to rein in the coronavirus include a partial lockdown of its richest and most populous region Lombardy around the financial capital Milan , the prime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday . 
Earlier , the government published its new package of measures which toughen up nationwide curbs and divide the country into three zones - red , orange and yellow , according to the intensity of the epidemic . 
The zoning depends on a raft of factors including local infection rates and hospital occupancy , with restrictions will calibrated accordingly . 
In the critically affected red zones people will only be allowed to leave their homes for work , health reasons or emergencies and bars , restaurants and most shops will be closed . 
However , unlike in Italy ’s national lockdown in the spring , all factories will remain open . 
Speaking at a news conference to illustrate the package which comes into effect on Friday , Conte said the red zones would comprise the large northern regions of Lombardy and neighbouring Piedmont , along with Calabria in Italy ’s southern toe and the tiny alpine region of Valle D ’Aosta . 
Lombardy accounts for around a sixth of Italy ’s population and more than a fifth of its gross domestic product .
