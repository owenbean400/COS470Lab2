Father Christmas wears a mask and can travel the world thanks to a special permit , Italy ’s prime minister said on Thursday , in a bid to ease children ’s fears that Santa may also be under lockdown this year . 
Giuseppe Conte wrote on Facebook : Father Christmas assured me that he already has an international travel certificate : he can travel everywhere and distribute gifts to all the world ’s children . 
He was responding to a desperate letter by five year old Tommaso who had pleaded with him not to confine Babbo Natale , as Santa is known in Italy . 
Conte said : He confirmed to me that he always uses a mask and maintains a correct distance to protect himself and everyone he meets . 
He then suggested to the boy that he put a bottle of hand sanitising gel under the tree , along with warm milk and biscuits . 
The Italian PM continued : I ’m letting you know that it wo not be necessary to tell Father Christmas that you were good in your letter , because I already told him . 
I also found out that you wanted to ask Father Christmas to chase away the coronavirus . 
Do not forget to ask for another present . 
Italy , the first European country hit by coronavirus earlier this year , has recorded a surge in cases in recent weeks and has topped one million infections in total . 
Several types of restrictions have been imposed nationwide and at a local level , depending on the health situation in different regions . 
But a growing number of medical workers and politicians are calling for stricter measures , and even a second nationwide lockdown . 
Whatever the evolution of the pandemic in the coming weeks , the regional affairs minister Francesco Boccia said on Thursday that Christmas would only be celebrated among close family members .
