Oliver Milman , an environment reporter for Guardian in New York , has some analysis on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic in the US . 
A model relied upon by the White House , from the University of Washington , estimates that the virus will " peter out " in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer . 
This is based on the experiences of China and Italy , previous coronavirus hotspots . 
But this model , like all predictions , is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission . 
Other forecasts have been more pessimistic , warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer . 
Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second , much more severe , increase in infections . 
The sheer size of the US , as well as its large population , means that there will be several ‘ peaks ’ at different times across the country . 
While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York , areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus."That is going to be confusing for people , " said Doug Burgum , governor of North Dakota . 
" If wow , New York had all these deaths and they are opening up , why are not we opening ? 
That will be a communication challenge for us , but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this . "
