Police forces in England and Wales can return to handing out 10,000 " super fines " to those who break lockdown rules on gatherings - less than a week after they were told to stop using them , PA media reports . 
The levies were suspended last Friday when police chiefs flagged the potential disparity in punishment between those who accept the fixed penalty notice ( FPN ) and those who challenged them in court . 
The National Police Chiefs ’ Council ( NPCC ) pointed out to the Home Office that when FPN ’s go before magistrates they are means tested , meaning the recipient ’s ability to pay is taken into account . 
It means those who fight the case can potentially pay significantly less than those who accept the FPN and agree to hand over the full amount within 28 days . 
The NPCC said on Tuesday it was " working urgently " with the government to solve the issue .
