Canada has signed several agreements for potential Covid 19 vaccines , hoping they will be available to a large segment of the population by the end of next year , one of the country ’s leading doctors said on Tuesday . 
It is the first timeline laid out for distribution of a vaccine that Ottawa has provided since Pfizer Inc last week . 
On Monday , Moderna reported that their inoculation candidates had been extremely effective in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus . 
Canada has signed agreements for millions of doses of each of these potential vaccines , which prime minister Justin Trudeau has signalled could arrive for distribution to the most vulnerable in the first quarter of 2021 . 
Howard Njoo , the Deputy Chief Medical Officer , told reporters : If all goes well ... we ’ll have a suite of vaccines available , and if we get delivery of those vaccines , I certainly can anticipate that as the year goes on ... ( Canadians ) will be able to be vaccinated and have a large part of the population covered by the end of the year .
