The 2021 Welsh Parliament election may be delayed by six months if necessary due to the coronavirus pandemic , the First Minister has announced . 
Mark Drakeford said providing the Senedd â€™s presiding officer with the power to move back the poll from May 6 represented " a major constitutional step " , but only to be used as a " last resort " . 
On Tuesday , he said : " We are focused on enabling the election to happen as planned , but it would be irresponsible of us not to make plans in case the pandemic is so serious in May next year where it would not be safe to hold an election . 
Drakeford , who is leader of the Welsh Labour party , added that legislation would be brought forward to the Senedd in January " if the situation after Christmas suggests that we will need to do this as a final resort " .
