Italy is preparing new restrictions as daily infections surpassed 5,000 in recent days for the first time since March . 
Deaths linked to the virus , however , are far lower than at the peak of the pandemic in spring . 
Health minister Roberto Speranza said he had proposed a nationwide ban on private parties , while Rome would also target opening hours for bars and restaurants . 
Speranza said Italy needed to add restrictions after having eased them for several weeks , as it aims to avoid a new national lockdown . 
" Now we need a change of pace , and to intervene with measures , not comparable to those adopted in the past , which could allow us to put the contagion under control and avoid tougher measures later on , " he said in an interview with RAI state TV . 
Earlier on Sunday , foreign minister Luigi Di Maio ruled out another national lockdown , saying the economy could not afford it .
