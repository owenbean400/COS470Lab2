Italy is carrying out tests on 180 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean with a view to transferring them to a quarantine vessel in Sicily , an interior ministry source has said . 
The migrants were on the Ocean Viking ship operated by SOS Méditerranée for over a week , with fights and suicide attempts onboard prompting the charity to declare a state of emergency on Friday , Agence France Presse reports . 
A medical team sent by authorities in Pozzallo , Sicily , " ascertained the absence of particular health problems and also reported that some tensions that had been registered on the ship are being overcome " , the ministry source said on Saturday . 
The medical team is testing the migrants for the Covid 19 virus after which they will be transferred to a quarantine ship currently in Porto Empedocle , also in Sicily .
