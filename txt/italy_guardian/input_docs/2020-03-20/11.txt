Any irresponsible failure to adopt social distancing must end , Ireland ’s president has said . 
Michael D Higgins appealed to young people to respond to official advice on limiting the spread of Covid 19 . 
Another 126 cases were confirmed in Ireland on Friday , bringing the total to 683 , and three people have died . 
Higgins signed into law emergency health legislation giving the power to impose detention and other measures . 
These new health and social measures may be difficult for many but they affect us all and we are at a point now when a person ’s actions have consequences not only for themselves but for all in society . 
Irresponsible individual action puts all at risk . 
We must draw on our strengths now . 
Large numbers of young people have been seen socialising in Dublin ’s Temple Bar , despite a high profile warning against gatherings a short time earlier from the taoiseach , Leo Varadkar .
