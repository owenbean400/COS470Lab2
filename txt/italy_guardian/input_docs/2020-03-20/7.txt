In the UK , where the prime minister has told the likes of pubs and restaurants to close their doors , the British Beer and Pub Association has welcomed measures announced at the same time aimed at keeping firms in business . 
The association ’s chief executive , Emma Mc Clarkin , has said : The government has been clear that pubs must now shut down . 
The safety and wellbeing of people is our priority . 
We stand ready to play our part in the fight against Covid 19 and in the process protecting our communities and employees . 
As a sector employing nearly one million people , the chancellor ’s support package announced today on staff wages will safeguard thousands of livelihoods and help closed pubs try to get through this difficult period . 
We stand ready to work with the government to ensure that the support is accessible as fast as possible . 
There remain areas where we need further support to sustain our great brewing and pub sector through this difficult time , to ensure that all staff will have jobs to return to and to guarantee all pubs can reopen again when this crisis is over and continue to be at the heart of communities up and down the country .
