There are growing calls for low risk prisoners in the UK to be released , with former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick warning against prisons becoming " incubators " for the coronavirus . 
Speaking on the BBC ’s Newsnight programme , he said : If you ’re talking about low risk prisoners coming to the end of their sentences , it ’s perfectly possible to manage them in the community safely . 
No one is saying you ’re going to let out huge numbers of dangerous people , but you can reduce pressure on the system by letting out a bit early people who maybe have got a month or two longer to serve . 
He warned " hundreds " of prison staff were off work and self isolating and that more prisoners " undoubtedly " had the virus than those confirmed so far . 
Hardwick said a typical prison cell was " a bit wider than my outstretched arms , maybe twice as long , there would be two men in it , a toilet , and they ’re going to be there 24 hours a day " . 
Now people may not be sympathetic to that , but be clear , people doing short sentences are going to be released back into the community and if we allow prisons to be incubators for the disease that ’s a problem for us all . 
People are coming into the system , so if you do not let people out and you keep pushing people in , the system simply wo not be able to cope .
