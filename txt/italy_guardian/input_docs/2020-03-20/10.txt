We reported earlier that the District of Columbia and New Jersey were announcing new restrictions . 
Now , the governor of Illinois , Jay Pritzker , has ordered all residents to " shelter in place " , beginning on Saturday evening ( CDT ) . 
All non essential businesses are to close indefinitely . 
Using a term that usually refers to the response to mass shootings , the governor said : To avoid the loss of tens of thousands of lives we must order an immediate shelter in place . 
Pritzker said the order does not mean people cannot go outside at all , but they are to stay home unless it is essential to go to food shops , pharmacies , doctors ’ office , fuel stations , or other essential places . 
He called it a very difficult choice and said in the short term it likely cost some people jobs . 
Ultimately , you ca not have a livelihood if you do not have a life . 
The governor also said the scheduled date for all public schools in the state to reopen has been indefinitely postponed . 
I want to be honest with you : we do not know yet all the steps that we ’re going to have to take . 
The clampdown follows similar orders in California and New York .
