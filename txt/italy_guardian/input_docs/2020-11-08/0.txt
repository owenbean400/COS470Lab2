The coronavirus pandemic had a devastating effect on Italy in the spring – now , as the country fights back the virus ’s second wave , thousands of small villages are " fighting to stay alive " , Lorenzo Tondo writes . 
Set among the forests at the foot of Mount Kalfa , Roccafiorita is the smallest village in southern Italy . 
The average age of its 187 inhabitants is over 60 . 
If Covid were to spread among the population , the village could disappear . 
" I ’m worried , " 93 year old Salvatore Occhino said . 
" If Covid strikes hard , there will be no one left in Roccafiorita . 
My heart cries out when I think of all the sacrifices we ’ve made to keep this village alive . 
Now we can only place ourselves in the Lord ’s hands . "
