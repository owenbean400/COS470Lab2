Italy will make swab tests for Covid 19 compulsory for people travelling from the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Belgium and the Czech Republic , the health minister Roberto Speranza said on Wednesday , following growing concerns about rising cases across Europe . 
Speranza wrote on Facebook and Twitter : The infection rate is growing throughout Europe , and of course also in Italy . 
For this reason today we have extended the state of emergency until January 31 and masks must be worn outdoors . 
I have also signed a regulation that provides for tests for those arriving from Belgium , Holland , Great Britain and the Czech Republic . 
Today , more than ever , everyone ’s contribution to stopping the virus is important . 
I numeri del contagio crescono in tutta Europa e naturalmente anche in Italia . 
Da oggi obbligo di mascherine anche all ’aperto e test per chi arriva da Belgio , Olanda , Gran Bretagna e Repubblica Ceca . 
Ora più che mai è importante il contributo di tutti per fermare il virus .
