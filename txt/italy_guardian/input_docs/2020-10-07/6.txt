The US state of Wisconsin will open a field hospital outside of Milwaukee to deal with the surge in Covid 19 cases that have overwhelmed hospitals across the state , the governor Tony Evers said on Wednesday . 
The hospital will open within the next week after hospitalisations across the state nearly tripled over the last month . 
There were 853 patients hospitalised with Covid 19 as of Tuesday , an increase of 71 from the day before , Evers said in a statement . 
In April , we announced the construction of the Wisconsin State Fair Park Alternative Care Facility to help support healthcare systems in the southeast region and across the state , should there be a surge in # COVID19 cases . 
Unfortunately , today , we announced that we have received a request to open that facility as our healthcare systems are becoming overwhelmed by the surge of COVID 19 cases , especially in the Fox Valley and northern regions of our state . 
We hoped this day would not come , but unfortunately , in just a month our hospitalizations have nearly tripled with 853 Wisconsinites hospitalized as of yesterday .
