Italy has made it mandatory to wear face masks outdoors nationwide in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus , as new infections rose to the highest daily tally since April . 
The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months . 
It will probably be effective from Thursday , a government source said . 
Several Italian regions including Lazio , around the capital Rome , had already made face masks mandatory . 
Data from the health ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours , up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since 24 April . 
Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France , Spain and the UK . 
As a part of Rome ’s effort to curb the spread of the virus , the health minister Roberto Speranza on Wednesday ordered compulsory testing on travellers from the United Kingdom , Belgium , the Netherlands and Czech Republic [ see 8.35pm ] . 
Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard hit by Covid 19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after the UK , with 36,061 deaths recorded since the outbreak began in February , according to official figures . 
Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world , the government managed to get the virus under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast . 
However , daily Covid related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy ’s epidemic six months ago . Some 31 people died on Wednesday , the health ministry said , while 24 April , the last day with more than 3,000 cases , saw 420 deaths . 
The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid 19 state of emergency to 31 January . 
The state of emergency , originally due to expire in mid October , gives greater powers to central government , making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision making in Italy .
