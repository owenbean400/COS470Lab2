US President Donald Trump has publicly ranted at car manufacturing giant General Motors over a delay in its production of ventilators . 
There has been some suggestions he could invoke the Defense Production Act , which allows the federal government to direct industries . 
General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio , or some other plant , and START MAKING VENTILATORS , NOW ! ! ! ! ! ! 
FORD , GET GOING ON VENTILATORS , FAST ! ! ! ! ! ! 
@ General Motors @ Ford His tweet comes a day after he dismissed demands from governors for more ventilators and said New York , which is the epicentre of the crisis in the US , was exaggerating the need . 
The state of New York pleaded to be sent 30,000 ventilators to help with its growing numbers of coronavirus patients .
