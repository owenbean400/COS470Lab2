After many delays , and then a series of tweets earlier today , US President Donald Trump is invoking the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to built ventilators for hospitals , he announced at the White House ’s daily coronavirus briefing . 
The Defense Production Act gives the president powers to direct domestic industrial production to provide essential materials and goods needed in a national security crisis . 
It allows the president to require businesses and corporations to prioritize and accept contracts for required materials and services . 
While Trump likes to work cooperatively with the private sector , he said , " Where an emergency exists and it ’s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly , we will do what we have to do . " 
" It ’s been a brutal pandemic , " Trump said at the beginning of the briefing .
