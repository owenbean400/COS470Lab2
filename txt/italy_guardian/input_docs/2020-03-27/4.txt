Brazil ’s polemicist president Jair Bolsonaro has sparked further outrage by insinuating that the number of coronavirus cases here is being inflated for political purposes and declaring : " Some people will die . 
I ’m sorry . 
That ’s life . " 
Bolsonaro is facing furious criticism for his slaphappy handling of the coronavirus crisis , which he continues to dismiss as overblown and has called a media " trick " . 
But on Friday afternoon — as the death toll here rose to 92 , with 3,417 cases — he doubled down on his position telling Brazilian television he suspected those figures were being inflated by a political rival and denounced coronavirus " alarmism " . 
Bolsonaro subsequently admitted lives would be lost but added : " That ’s life . " 
" You ca not shut down a car factory because people die in traffic accidents , " Bolsonaro said . 
Brazil ’s far right leader — who is pushing for tough lockdown measures to be lifted in states across the country — is facing growing fury from across the political spectrum and the country ’s media . 
In an article titled " Trial of the future " , the Brazilian writer Ruy Castro captured the revolt : " There ’s a sense that , if Jair Bolsonaro is not tied to a tree and gagged , before making any more disastrous moves , the cost in lives will be incalculable . 
But one day these lives will be counted . " 
Castro added : " Every single member of the government who , with their deeds or words , opposed the policy of social distancing and helped coronavirus spread will have to pay the price ... 
It is not right to call Jair Bolsonaro irresponsible . 
He is the person most responsible for whatever happens in Brazil — and he will have to answer for it . "
