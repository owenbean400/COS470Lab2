A sharp fall in Covid 19 cases in Ireland is likely to stall following the ending on 1 December of six weeks of strict lockdown , a senior health official said on Thursday . 
" I would not expect case counts to decline any further in the coming week or 10 days , " Philip Nolan , the chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group told journalists after reporting a seven day daily new case average of 254 , down from almost 1,200 six weeks ago . Ireland â€™s Covid 19 reproduction number , which measures the number of people who become infected from each positive case , is currently between 0.8 and 1 , but is likely to rise over the Christmas period as social contacts increase , Nolan said .
