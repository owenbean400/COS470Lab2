Mass coronavirus testing will begin in Slovenia this month as restrictions imposed to tackle the pandemic have not had the desired effect , the government said Thursday . 
The nationwide programme should start after 11 or 12 December , when the first 100,000 test kits are expected to be delivered , the health minister Tomaz Gantar told a news conference , adding that the government planned to acquire a total of 1.5 million antigen tests . 
While health and care home workers are already being tested for coronavirus , the government plans to broaden the scheme to include other key members of the workforce such as teachers , soldiers and policemen . 
By the end of the year the tests , which provide a result within minutes , will be offered to all citizens that apply for it , Gantar said . 
" Due to the high number of daily cases , we ca not track all of their contacts which is why massive testing makes sense , " Gantar explained . 
He also announced that the lockdown measures in force since mid November would be extended for at least another week . 
" I had hoped [ restrictions would provide ] better results , " Gantar admitted . 
Slovenia , a country of two million people , has been severely hit by the second wave of coronavirus bringing to almost 1,600 the number of people that have died from over 80,000 cases have been confirmed so far . 
In November , public transport was suspended and almost all gatherings were banned . 
Also schools and non essential stores and services have remained closed .
