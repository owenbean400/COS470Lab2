The Guardian â€™s editorial on vaccine distribution : As the pandemic took hold around the world , one image came to capture the wildly differing experiences of a common crisis : " We are in the same storm , but we are not all in the same boat . " 
This is equally applicable to our escape from the storm . 
The speed with which vaccines have been developed is incredible ; the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine is due to be used in the UK within days . 
But reaching the billions who need them worldwide may be even more challenging . 
It will depend not only on the technical capacity to produce and deliver doses , but on the behaviour of better off nations . 
In the 2009 swine flu pandemic , high income countries bought up all vaccine stocks . 
The evidence suggests that this time , too , they are snatching up supplies at a rate which could leave poorer countries waiting for years .
