Fans at Premier League matches will have to wear face masks at all times when they return this weekend as part of a plan to get stadiums back to one third capacity by the end of the season . 
The regulations , which also include a mandatory temperature check on arrival , go beyond the government ’s guidance for fans . 
Supporters will also be told not to excessively sing or shout and to moderate their behaviour so they do not high five or hug . 
The rules , agreed at a Premier League shareholders ’ meeting on Thursday , are part of a wider plan to show the government that football can safely handle the return of fans . 
The hope is that some grounds could have up to 20,000 spectators at the end of the season , especially with a vaccine about to be rolled out . 
The requirement for fans to wear face masks in their seats will reduce the risk of transmission from singing and shouting , and make it easier for stadiums to comply with Sports Grounds Safety Authority rules relating to social distancing . 
With masks fans can be seated a metre apart , whereas the requirement is two metres for those without .
