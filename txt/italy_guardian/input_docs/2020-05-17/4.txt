Now for something a little lighter : socially distant blessings delivered with a water pistol . 
The priest in the photo , Father Tim Pelc , told Buzz Feed News that he was a little concerned about how the Vatican might react when the photos of him squirting holy water began circulating widely on the internet , but has not heard anything about it yet . 
A Priest giving social distance blessings with a squirt pistol and what , I 'm assuming , is Holy water . 2020 folks .
