Scores of Mexicans are dying from drinking adulterated liquor , a consequence of the shortage of mainstream alcoholic beverages during the coronavirus pandemic , authorities say . 
AFP reports that the first of at least 121 deaths in recent weeks occurred at the end of April in the western state of Jalisco , almost exactly a month after the government declared a health emergency over the spread of Covid 19 . 
As much of Mexico has run out of beer after factories producing liquor and beer were shut down , gangs specialising in bootleg booze are trying to take advantage of the lack of alternative alcohol sources . 
Beer stocks were almost depleted within a month , and in some areas the prices of what was left doubled , according to industry sources . 
Many of the 53 deaths in central Puebla province have been linked to a wake where people drank moonshine containing methanol – a wood alcohol that in non lethal doses can cause blindness and liver damage . 
Twenty three people died in the hours following the gathering in the town of Chiconcuautla , according to authorities . 
The town ’s mayor said the popular " refino " drink , made from sugarcane , had been adulterated . 
German Hernandez said his father died after being poisoned by a drink known locally as " tejon " – a blend of brandy with tejocote fruit ( a type of hawthorn ) in the Puebla town of Cacaloxuchitl . 
" They sell it in the stores , and you can buy it and take it out . 
My father began trembling and feeling weak . 
He told us he felt bad , and we took him to the hospital , " Hernandez told AFP . 
" This has never happened before . " 
Deaths have also been recorded in the central state of Morelos and Yucatan and Veracruz in the east .
