People who have returned to the UK from any part of Italy in the past fortnight are being advised to self isolate if they begin to feel unwell . 
Previously , the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded , but the government has now announced that the guidance is being extended to cover the whole country . 
Prof Chris Whitty , England ’s chief medical officer , said the move was needed because of the evolving situation in Italy . 
He told a press conference earlier this evening : The situation in Italy means that we have decided it is prudent at this point to move from a geographical area of north Italy ... to a geographical situation for all of Italy . 
The pattern of what people do is exactly the same as before . 
It ’s about people from those areas , except for the cities which the Italian government specifies in lockdown , all other areas , only people who have got symptoms need to self isolate .
