Here is the full story on Trump ’s hydroxycholorquine claims : Donald Trump has told reporters at the White House that for " a couple weeks " he has been taking a malaria drug as a defense against Covid 19 – despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous . 
The drug is not approved as a treatment for Covid 19 and Trump has not been diagnosed with the disease , to public knowledge . 
Trump ’s claim to be taking the drug was made as he attacked an administration whistleblower who went before Congress last week and described internal pressure to endorse the drug as an effective coronavirus treatment . 
The whistleblower , Rick Bright , was the former director of a federal agency in charge of vaccines . 
On Monday , Trump called Bright a hypocrite and then riffed on the supposed benefits of the drug , which the FDA advised has " not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID 19 " . 
" You ’d be surprised at how many people are taking it … The front line workers many many are taking it , " Trump said . 
" I happen to be taking it . 
I happen to be taking it . 
I ’m taking it , hydroxychloroquine . 
Right now , yeah . 
A couple weeks ago I started taking it . 
Because I think it ’s good , I heard a lot of good stories … I take a pill every day . "
