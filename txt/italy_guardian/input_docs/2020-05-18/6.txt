If Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine , he is going against the advice of his own administration . 
The FDA has warned against using hydroxychloroquine or a related compound , chloroquine , for treating or preventing Covid 19 without medical supervision in a hospital , or as part of a clinical trial . 
In late April , the FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said : While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid 19 , there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered . 
The FDA will continue to monitor and investigate these potential risks and will communicate publicly when more information is available .
