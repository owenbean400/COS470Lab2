A hotel worker in the northern Italian city of Verona has tested negative for coronavirus . 
The woman , who was isolated after coming down with a fever , is a member of staff at the same hotel where a Chinese couple being treated for the virus in Rome stayed for one night . 
Doctors at Rome ’s Lazzaro Spallanzani hospital for infectious disease said the couple were in a " stable " condition after their health deteriorated on Tuesday . 
Twenty people who had contact with the couple , from Wuhan but who have not shown symptoms of the virus , are still under observation at the hospital . 
Meanwhile , Italy ’s three month suspension of flights from China , Hong , Macau and Taiwan sparked a diplomatic row with Taiwan . 
A representative from the Taiwanese government has urged Italy to drop the ban , arguing that the island is not part of China and that cases of the virus there have been limited . 
Italy on Wednesday began scanning passengers arriving on all international flights at its airports . 
Thermal scanners had previously only been used on passengers arriving from areas affected by the virus . 
At Rome ’s Fiumicino airport , the checks have also been extended to domestic flights .
