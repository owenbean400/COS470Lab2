Pope Francis will have to forgo meeting Catholics at the annual Advent and Christmas masses in the Vatican owing to the coronavirus pandemic , the specialist Catholic News Agency ( CNA ) has reported . 
The 83 year old pontiff was deprived of a congregation at Easter when he had to celebrate mass at Saint Peter ’s with very few people present . 
In a letter to foreign envoys to the Vatican , its foreign minister informed them that Christmas ceremonies would take " a private form " this year . 
Members of the diplomatic corps would not be present , and events would be made available online , a document seen by CNA said . 
Tens of thousands of Catholics typically visit Rome in December to attend services at the Vatican . 
The pope has scheduled a prayer on Saint Peter ’s Square on 8 December in lieu of a public appearance to honour the Virgin Mary , but he is still due to celebrate mass on Christmas Eve and deliver his traditional Urbi and Orbi message to the world . 
Pope Francis is fond of greeting the public , but since the Covid 19 pandemic hit Italy he has had to curtail his agenda , cancelling trips , receptions and ceremonies . 
Italy has reimposed restrictions to battle a second wave of the virus , and officials face a backlash after ordering restaurants and bars to shut from 6pm and theatres , cinemas and gyms to close for a month . 
The virus has killed more than 37,000 people in Italy , but thousands have also turned out in recent days to protest curbs on social activities .
