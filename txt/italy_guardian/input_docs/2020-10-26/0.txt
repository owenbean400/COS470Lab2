Italy ’s interior ministry is on high alert over fears of violence as protests take place in major cities against coronavirus restrictions . 
From Turin , Milan and Trieste in the north to Rome , Naples and Catania in the south , people have converged on squares to protest measures that include the 6pm closure of bars and restaurants and complete closure of gyms , swimmings pools , cinemas and theatres . 
Episodes of tension have been reported in Turin and Naples , where people are calling for the resignation of the recently re elected regional president , Vincenzo De Luca . 
Extremist groups influenced protests in Naples and Rome over the weekend , causing clashes with police . 
However , many of Monday ’s protests have so far been peaceful and attended mostly by those working in sectors that will be penalised by the measures , which will be in place until 24 November .
