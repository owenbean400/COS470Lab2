Protests are continuing across Italy against a new round of government coronavirus restrictions , with violence reported in at least two major northern cities , Milan and Turin . 
Witnesses said a number of luxury stores , including a Gucci fashion shop , were ransacked in central Turin as crowds of youths took to the streets after nightfall , letting off huge firecrackers and lighting coloured flares . 
Police responded with volleys of tear gas as they tried to restore order in the city , the capital of the wealthy Piedmont region . 
There were also clashes in Milan , the capital of the neighbouring Lombardy region , an area that has borne the brunt of the Covid 19 epidemic in Italy . 
" Freedom , freedom , freedom , " crowds chanted as they confronted police in the city centre . 
The Italian government on Sunday ordered bars and restaurants to close by 6pm and shut public gyms , cinemas and swimming pools to try to slow a second wave of coronavirus infections . 
A number of regions , including Lombardy and Piedmont , have also imposed night curfews . 
Many small businesses , still badly bruised by an initial nationwide lockdown in March and April , say the new restrictions could bankrupt them . 
While Italians complied peacefully to the spring lockdown , there has been an immediate pushback against the renewed restrictions . 
Protesters took to the streets of up to a dozen cities on Monday , including Treviso , Trieste , Viareggio , Latina , Rome , Naples , Salerno , Palermo , Siracusa and Catania . 
Looking to calm tensions , the government has said it will present a package of measures on Tuesday to support businesses hurt by the new restrictions .
