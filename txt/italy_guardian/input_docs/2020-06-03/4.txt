Restrictions may have to be reimposed in Iran if the country is hit by a second wave of infections , its president has warned , as local authorities say transmissions are creeping back towards the previous peak . 
Lockdown measures have been gradually lifted since April but have been reimposed in some areas after localised outbreaks . 
The health ministry , cited by state media , has reported 3,134 new infections in the past twenty four hours , the most since 30 March , bringing the total to 160,696 . 
And 70 more deaths brought the toll to 8,012 . 
The president Hassan Rouhani said : If in any part of the country these warnings are not taken seriously and God forbid the outbreak of illness peaks again , the authorities will have to reimpose restrictions . 
This issue will create problems for the ordinary life of citizens and will also bring serious economic damage to the society .
