Health officials in Portugal have insisted that increases in confirmed coronavirus cases in the Lisbon region are due to more tests being carried out in areas identified as hotspots , rather than signs of a second wave of outbreak . 
The health ministry on Wednesday announced 366 new cases nationally , the biggest daily increase in almost four weeks . 
Officials said 335 of those new cases were in the Lisbon metropolitan area , while the outbreak is waning in the rest of the country . 
The Lisbon total was almost double the number detected in the region the previous day . 
The secretary of state for health , Antonio Sales , said the governments strategy is to encircle the hotspots , which are in low income neighbourhoods around the capital , and run more tests there . 
Construction workers and temporary staff working in the service sector are being especially targeted for testing . 
The increase comes after Portugal eased restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus , leading to crowded beaches last week .
