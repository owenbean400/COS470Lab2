An Italian collective brought dozens of migrants to safety on Saturday , as the first charity rescue ship reached Italian shores since authorities had decided to close all ports because of the coronavirus pandemic in April . 
The arrival of the Mare Ionio ship in Pozzallo , Sicily , on World Refugee Day , was hailed by human rights organisations who noted the unusual speed with which Italy assigned the Mediterranea charity group a port . 
" For once , the international law obliging the offer of a safe port , in a short time , has been respected , " the group ’s head Alessandra Sciurba said in a statement . 
The Mare Ionio rescued 67 people on Friday after their boat ran into difficulty some 40 nautical miles ( 70km ) off Lampedusa . 
The group said the migrants had been without water for two days . 
" For the first time for years , a ‘ place of safety ’ has been assigned in less than 24 hours . 
It should be automatic , " Italian journalist and migrant specialist Nello Scavo tweeted . 
Mediterranea called for a port of safety to be extended also to the crew and migrants aboard the German Sea Watch 3 vessel , which took onboard around 100 people off the coast of Libya earlier this week . 
The Italian group said it was patrolling the central Mediterranean because European governments were failing to fulfil their responsibility " to safeguard human lives " . 
The International Organization for Migration ’s spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo told AFP that at least 227 people had died while attempting the perilous crossing since the start of the year .
