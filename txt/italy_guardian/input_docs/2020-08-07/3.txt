Italy has approved a new stimulus package aimed at helping businesses and families survive the coronavirus crisis , while Rome waits to receive funds from the European Union â€™s Recovery Fund . 
The government would use the extra spending , worth 25 billion euros ( $ 29.5 billion ) , to soften the blow to an economy ravaged by lockdown measures imposed to stem the Covid 19 pandemic , which has killed almost 35,200 people . 
Italy hopes to front load this year part of 209 billion euros in grants and cheap loans it should receive from the Recovery Fund starting in 2021 . 
The Italian economy has been among the worst hit by the crisis , facing an 11.2 % contraction this year , according to European Union estimates , the sharpest fall in the 27 nation bloc . 
" We have set aside 12 billion euros to support employment , " Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after a three hour Cabinet meeting . 
Part of the borrowing will be used to conditionally extend temporary layoff schemes for up to 18 weeks , with firms required not to cut jobs to qualify for state aid .
