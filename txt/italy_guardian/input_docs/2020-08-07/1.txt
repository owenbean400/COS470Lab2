President Donald Trump has said that after talks with Democratic lawmakers on coronavirus relief broke down , he did not want to provide aid to Democratic run cities and states and would go " a different way . " 
Pelosi and Schumer only interested in Bailout Money for poorly run Democrat cities and states . 
Nothing to do with China Virus ! 
Want one trillion dollars . 
No interest . 
We are going a different way !
