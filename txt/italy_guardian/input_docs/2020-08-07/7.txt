Australia passed 20,000 coronavirus cases yesterday , with case numbers doubling in less than a month thanks to the outbreak in the Victorian capital of Melbourne . 
Melbourne residents are beginning their first full weekend under stage four lockdown conditions , which will remain in place until 13 September . 
Changes reducing the output of abattoirs and meat processing plants came into effect at midnight Friday . 
Victoria recorded 450 new cases and 11 new deaths on Friday , with most of the deaths linked to aged care . 
More than 900 healthcare workers have now been diagnosed with the virus , putting pressures on hospital staffing . 
Queensland closed its border to residents from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory overnight , meaning more than half of Australia ’s population is now barred from entering the sunshine state . 
Meanwhile NSW tightened its border restrictions against Victoria , requiring anyone who travels to NSW from Victoria to undergo 14 days of mandatory supervised quarantine in a hotel – the same conditions imposed on people returning from overseas travel . 
NSW recorded 11 new coronavirus cases on Friday – the only state other than Victoria to record any increase – and is yet to trace the origin of two of the cases . 
The cap on international arrivals to Australia has been extended to 24 October .
