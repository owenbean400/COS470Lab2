Transparent facemasks and shields are costly compared with classic counterparts but could prove a boon for the deaf and hard of hearing battling to communicate in the coronavirus era . 
The concept has started to take off , aided not least by Youtube tutorials or the likes of American football coach Nic Saban , who makes a point of wearing his pitchside . 
Alabama football shared this photo of Nick Saban in his practice field mask . 
Other proponents include French secretary of state for people with disabilities Sophie Cluzel , who donned a mask with a see through section to speak in parliament , and a sign language interpreter at a Portsmouth hospital in southern England . 
As Cluzel pointed out , the transparent window facilitates communication by permitting lip reading and showing facial expressions . 
The deaf and the hard of hearing number about 70 million globally , according to the World Federation of the Deaf . 
According to AFP , the French federation of speech therapists says that classic facemasks mean " patients find themselves deprived of the main source of the oral message : the mouth and facial expressions . " 
Teachers say they too like the transparent model . 
Rory Burnham Pickett , a professor based in Sapporo in northern Japan , said : " I know it is frustrating that my pupils do not see my mouth or facial expression . 
I made my own transparent mask as they are difficult to find . " 
Governments are taking a proactive approach and are placing orders . 
Authorities in Quebec have placed an order for 100,000 for distribution across the health network in the Canadian province , local media say . 
In the United States , private US medical firm Clear Mask LLC said Tuesday it had received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for a fully transparent surgical mask for use in hospitals and clinics but also schools , retail and hospitality settings . 
The Baltimore based form was already producing non surgical versions .
