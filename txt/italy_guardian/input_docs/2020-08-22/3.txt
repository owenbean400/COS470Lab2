The Rome region in Italy recorded 215 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours to Sunday , mainly because of people returning from holiday , the largest such rise since the Italian capital was in lockdown in March , health officials said Saturday . 
The figure is a record number and is more than the 208 people infected in a one day period on 28 March , when Rome had come to a virtual standstill to stop the coronavirus spreading , the capital ’s health official Alessio D ’Amato said . 
" Sixty one percent [ of the cases ] are linked to people returning from vacation , " D ’Amato said , adding that almost half the cases were returning from Sardinia . 
Sardinia had been spared the first wave earlier this year , but D ’Amato said the movement of tourists and people partying have helped spread the virus . 
Most of those infected are young people who are not showing symptoms and it is urgent to " block the chain of transmission as fast as possible by finding the asymptomatic and averting the spread of the virus among families , he said , according to AFP . 
" Be very careful especially with your relatives and the people dearest to you , " he said in an appeal to the young . 
He warned them to stay home and not meet with people while awaiting test results . 
" Do not feel invincible , " he urged them . 
Italy , particularly the northern Lombardy region , the Venice area and Rome , are seeing a resurgence in the virus over the summer , even if the daily numbers remain below the national threshold of 1,000 - unlike in neighbouring France . 
The Italian government has taken several steps to block the spread , suych as closing nightclubs since 17 August and making mask wearing compulsory in busy public spaces between 6pm and 6am . 
Since the pandemic broke out , Italy has recorded more than 257,000 cases , including more than 35,000 deaths .
