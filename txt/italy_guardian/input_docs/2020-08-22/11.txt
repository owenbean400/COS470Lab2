Thousands of Israelis protested in Jerusalem on Saturday against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu again , as the country ’s summer outcry denouncing alleged corruption and the government ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic showed little signs of abating . 
A large crowd marched in the streets outside Netanyahu ’s official residence , waving signs and flags and calling for his resignation . 
Some protesters clashed with police , who arrested at least seven people . 
One police officer was injured , Reuters reports . 
The protest movement has gained traction in the summer months , with critics accusing Netanyahu of being distracted by a corruption case against him while Covid 19 cases have spiked . 
He denies wrongdoing . 
On Friday Israel passed 100,000 reported coronavirus cases . 
It has recorded 809 Covid 19 deaths among its 9 million population . 
The country is in a recession and unemployment hovers above 20 % . 
Netanyahu has condemned the demonstrations against him , accusing protesters of trampling democracy and the Israeli media of encouraging them . 
He has argued that Israel ’s economy is better positioned than many developed countries hit by the global pandemic . 
Saturday ’s protest comes just days before a 25 August deadline for the government to pass a state budget . 
A failure to do so will lead to general elections .
