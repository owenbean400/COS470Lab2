Ireland has reported 156 new coronavirus infections , the fourth highest daily tally since early May . 
It â€™s the fourth time in eight days that Ireland has reported more than 100 daily coronavirus cases . 
Ireland significantly tightened its nationwide coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday to try to rein in the new spike , which began in late July after cases had fallen to a daily average of around 20 for much of the previous two months . 
On Thursday , the Irish health minister , Stephen Donnelly , had said the country was " at a tipping point . " 
The government lifted separate stricter measures in two counties on Friday but extended them for two more weeks in Kildare , where there were 36 cases . 
Dublin accounted for 55 with the rest spread across the country , similar to previous days .
