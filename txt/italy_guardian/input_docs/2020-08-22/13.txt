England ’s chief medical officer has said it would be " foolish " to plan for winter on the basis of having a coronavirus vaccine . 
But professor Chris Whitty told reporters on Saturday that there was a " reasonable chance " there could be vaccines to the virus before the winter of 2021-2022 , the Press Association reports . 
He warned that going into winter there will be " real problems " with Covid 19 and said that the country should plan on the basis of no vaccine being available . 
He said : I would obviously be delighted if it came earlier rather than later but I ’d be quite surprised if we had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter , certainly before this side of Christmas . 
Now that may be wrong , a lot of people are doing a huge amount scientifically , logistically to make sure that ’s a pessimistic statement , to try and see if we can get a vaccine at extraordinarily fast speed but we have to check it works and we have to make sure it ’s safe and these things do take time . 
So I think if we look forward a year I think the chances are much greater than if we look forward six months and we need to have that sort of timescale in mind . 
So planning for the next winter , it would be foolish to plan on the basis we will have a vaccine . 
We should plan on the basis we will not have a vaccine and then if one does prove to be effective and safe and available then we ’re in a strong position to be able to use it and that will be great but we should be planning on the basis of what we currently have . 
Whitty added he was " confident in the long term " that science would have the ability " to get us out of this hole " , but stressed that this would be unlikely to be the case in the next few weeks or even months .
