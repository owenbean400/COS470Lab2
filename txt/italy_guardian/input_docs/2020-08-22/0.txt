Italy reported 1,071 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours , the health ministry said on Saturday , exceeding 1,000 cases in a day for the first time since May when the government eased its rigid lockdown measures . 
Italy , one of Europe â€™s worst hit countries , managed to contain the outbreak after a peak in deaths and cases between March and April . 
However , the country has seen a steady increase in infections over the last month , with experts blaming gatherings of people associated with holidays and nightlife . 
Last time the country recorded a higher figure was on 12 May , with 1,402 cases , six days before restaurants , bars and shops were allowed to reopen after a 10 week lockdown , Reuters reports .
