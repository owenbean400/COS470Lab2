UK guidance for people aged 70 and over to self isolate is leaving people aged 60 to 69 at increased risk from coronavirus , say scientists . 
Prof Azeem Majeed and colleagues at Imperial College London ( ICL ) noted that other countries had different policies and the World Health Organization said the highest risk was in over 60s . 
According to a paper published by the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University , the death rate among people in their 70s is 8 % , and the rate among those in their 60s is 3.6 % , which the ICL scientists said was " still substantial " . 
They recommend that the 7.3 million people in their 60s in the UK should be more careful about physical distancing and personal hygiene .
