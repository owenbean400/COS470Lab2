Dr Birx says the US has one of the lowest mortality rates worldwide – meaning deaths per number of confirmed infections . 
It ’s worth remembering however that the US has the highest number of deaths – 44,228 according to Johns Hopkins University data – which is just under 20,000 more people who have died than in Italy , which has lost 24,648 people to the virus . 
Trump also mentioned the mortality rate . 
From my colleague Maanvi Singh : " Our mortality rate remains roughly half " that of other countries , Trump said , adding that the rate was " one of the lowest in any other country in the world . " 
The president is half right — the US does indeed appear to have a lower case fatality rate than several countries , including Italy , Belgium and the UK , according to the Johns Hopkins tracker . 
The case fatality rate refers to the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases . 
Johns Hopkins has calculated that figure for about 130 countries . but the US ’s rate is far from the " lowest " of any country . 
The US rate is 5.4 % — more double the rate of Japan and South Korea ( 2.2 % ) , and several times the rate of Singapore , with a rate . of . 1 % .
