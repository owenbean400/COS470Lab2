The governor of Italy ’s southern Campania region has blasted the Halloween holiday as a " stupid American extravagance " and a " monument to imbecility " , as he announced a 10pm curfew in Naples and the surrounding region over Halloween weekend . 
Vincenzo De Luca blamed " irresponsible " young people for Campania ’s surge in infections , and this week closed schools for in person learning for two weeks , the Associated Press reports . 
While Italy has long celebrated the religious holidays of All Saints and All Souls , Halloween has only taken off in the last generation , most strongly in the Italian south . 
Campania was largely spared the first wave of Covid 19 , but the region is now one of the worst hit in Italy and is reaching a critical stage given it has far fewer hospital beds , intensive care units and medical personnel than other regions of a similar size . 
De Luca won praise — and another term in office — for taking a tough line to keep infections down during Italy ’s initial outbreak . 
But his decision to shift all learning online prompted criticism from the education minister and protests from parents .
