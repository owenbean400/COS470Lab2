In the UK , three different households will be allowed to mix inside over the festive period under new plans announced today . 
But leading scientists have sounded a note of caution . 
Here is what they plan to do to this Christmas . 
Dr Julian Tang , clinical virologist and honorary associate professor in the respiratory sciences department at the University of Leicester " We ’ve agreed to just have Christmas via Zoom/telephone link as we think this is safest . 
We ’re quite used to this now and have been doing it mostly this way for the past 10 months . " 
Prof Susan Michie , director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and member of the government ’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science ( SPI B ) With one household who usually joins us for Christmas Day we are planning to have drinks on the pavement before lunch . 
We will probably spend more time outside and less inside , with more distancing , ventilation and lots of warm clothes ! 
Prof Christina Pagel , director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at UCL and a member of the Independent Sage group of scientists It all depends on the Covid situation in December but our plan is to be extra careful ( no meetings outside the household ) the 10 days before Christmas , so we can then celebrate with my parents who are both in the extremely vulnerable category .
