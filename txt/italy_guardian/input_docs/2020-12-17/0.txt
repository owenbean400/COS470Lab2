An overnight curfew from 11pm will come into force in Portugal on New Year ’s Eve , prime minister António Costa said , as the country introduces measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus during the usually busy night . 
" We have to totally cut out on New Year celebrations , " Costa told reporters after a meeting with ministers , adding people would not be allowed to leave their homes between 11pm and 5am from 1-3 January . 
Two weeks ago , Costa had said people would be able to return home before a 2am curfew on New Year ’s Eve . 
But a previously announced reevaluation of measures took into consideration the current pandemic situation and forced the government to take a step back . 
" The number of cases per week are dropping but not as fast as they were before , " Costa said , explaining the government decided to toughen New Year ’s Eve measures so rules over Christmas were not as severe . 
There is no limit on how many people can gather per household for Christmas and a ban on domestic travel will not be imposed between 23-26 December . 
" Christmas celebrations have to be carried out with the utmost care , " he said , urging people to avoid poorly ventilated spaces and to use face masks during family gatherings whenever possible . 
After a relatively mild first wave of the disease compared with countries such as Spain or Italy , Portugal has had a record number of infections and deaths during the second wave though the daily tally has dropped slightly in recent weeks . 
Portugal , which has a population of just over 10 million , has recorded 362,616 confirmed cases of Covid 19 and 5,902 deaths .
