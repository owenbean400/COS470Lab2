Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has issued a scathing criticism of the Italian government ’s handling of the coronavirus , saying he was humiliated by a recent lockdown . 
His surprise comments at a conference in Italy ’s senate were remarkable because the 61 year old superstar was a symbol of national unity at the height of the lockdown on Easter Sunday when he sang in an empty Milan cathedral in a live streamed solo performance called Music for Hope . 
" I felt humiliated and offended . 
I could not leave the house even though I had committed no crime , " Bocelli said at the conference attended by opposition politicians including Matteo Salvini , leader of the far right League party who has attacked the government of prime minister Giuseppe Conte over the handling of the coronavrius crisis . 
A national lockdown began in early March and was eased in stages over three months . 
Bocelli confessed he disobeyed lockdown rules " because I did not think it was right or healthy to stay home at my age " . 
He also said he believed the situation could not have been as serious as authorities were saying because he did not know anyone who had to go into intensive care . 
" So what was all this sense of gravity for ? " he said . 
More than 35,000 Italians have died from the coronavirus . 
Regulations regarding social distancing and wearing masks in indoor public places such as stores are still in effect and Bocelli seemed to encourage civil disobedience . 
" Let ’s refuse to follow this rule . 
Let ’s read books , move around , get to know each other , talk , dialogue ..." he said .
