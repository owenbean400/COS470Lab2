The coronavirus was present in two large Italian cities in December , more than two months before the first case was detected , a national health institute study of waste water has found . 
That suggests the virus appeared in Italy around the same time it was first reported in China . 
Researchers discovered genetic traces of Sars Co V 2 - as the virus is officially known - in samples of waste water collected in Milan and Turin at the end of last year , and Bologna in January , the ISS institute said in a statement seen by AFP on Friday . 
Italy ’s first known native case was discovered mid February . 
The results " help to understand the start of the circulation of the virus in Italy , " the ISS said . 
They also " confirm the by now consolidated international evidence " as to the strategic function of sewer samples as an early detection tool , it added . 
The results feed into an effort by scientists around the world to trace the virus ’s family tree .
