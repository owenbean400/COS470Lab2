Pope Francis has taken aim at protests against coronavirus restrictions , contrasting them with the " healthy indignation " seen in demonstrations against racism after the death of George Floyd . 
" Some groups protested , refusing to keep their distance , marching against travel restrictions – as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom , " he said in a new book . 
He railed against those who claim " that being forced to wear a mask is an unwarranted imposition by the state " . 
You ’ll never find such people protesting the death of George Floyd , or joining a demonstration because there are shantytowns where children lack water or education , or because there are whole families who have lost their income . 
On such matters they would never protest ; they are incapable of moving outside of their own little world of interests .
