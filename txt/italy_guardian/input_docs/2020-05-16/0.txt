Italy ’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has announced the easing of a series of lockdown restrictions , including the reopening of all shops , bars , restaurants and hairdressers , from 18 May , provided that the regional guidelines aimed at containing the risk of infection are observed . 
In an address to the nation on Saturday evening , Conte said efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak had brought results , and that Italy was ready for a new phase in the fight against the pandemic , provided there was enough trust and responsibility in the population . 
On 25 May , gyms , swimming pools and sports centres will be able to open , but will be required to adhere to safety protocols . 
From 3 June , people can travel from region to region , unless the Italian government exercises containment measures based on the risk of infection in any given area , and people arriving from EU member states will no longer be subject to a mandatory quarantine . 
Conte added that specific restrictions could be introduced at local level if necessary . 
More certainties were needed , he said , before the country ’s top football league , Serie A , could resume games , but said teams were allowed to resume full squad training from 18 May . " We are taking a calculated risk , aware that the contagion curve could rise again , " Conte told reporters in the courtyard of his official Rome residence , according to Bloomberg . 
" We are taking this risk and we have to accept it , otherwise we could not restart . 
We cannot wait for a vaccine . "
