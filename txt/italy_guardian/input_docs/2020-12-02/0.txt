Italians will not be able to attend midnight mass or move between regions over the Christmas period , a top health ministry official said on Wednesday , as the country battles high coronavirus infection rates and deaths . 
Italy has been reporting more daily Covid 19 fatalities than any other European nation in recent weeks and , while the increase in new cases and hospital admissions is slowing , the government is worried about gatherings over Christmas . 
The junior health minister Sandra Zampa said Christmas Eve mass must end by around 8:30pm so that worshippers can return home before a 10pm curfew , and people should not invite non family members home for Christmas lunch or other celebrations . 
" From December 20 , people will only be able to travel outside their own region for emergencies such as to care for a single parent , " she said in an interview with private television channel La7 . 
The government has already said ski resorts will be closed over the Christmas and New Year period . 
The cabinet is meeting late on Wednesday to decide the details of restrictions over coming weeks , which the prime minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to outline at a news conference on Thursday .
