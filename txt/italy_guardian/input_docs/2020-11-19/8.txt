Research shows that people with coronavirus are more likely to be highly infectious in the first week after symptoms appear . 
A study , published in the Lancet Microbe , found that while genetic material of the Sars Cov 2 virus was detected in samples from sufferers for several weeks afterwards , no live virus was found in any samples collected nine days after symptoms began . 
Lead author , Dr Muge Cevik of the University of St Andrews said : " Our findings are in line with contact tracing studies which suggest the majority of viral transmission events occur very early , and especially within the first five days after symptom onset , indicating the importance of self isolation immediately after symptoms start .
