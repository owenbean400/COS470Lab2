The Scottish parliament has voted to support stricter Covid 19 measures , including tougher restrictions in 11 council areas and a travel ban . 
On Tuesday , first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that areas of west and central Scotland would be moved from tier 3 to tier 4 from Friday , for three weeks . 
Non essential shops , and hospitality businesses will close , along with gyms and beauty salons . 
The new limits will make it illegal to enter or leave Scotland without a reasonable excuse , with those breaking it facing a minimum £ 60 fine . 
MSPs voted by 99 to 23 to express Holyrood ’s support for the restrictions , rather than to accept or reject them , according to PA Media .
