Aged care numbers are dropping . 
Is Brett Sutton confident that the outbreak in the sector is under control ? 
The numbers are under control . 
Again , there ’s a fragility there because every single new case needs to be doing the right thing , testing as soon as they get symptoms and isolating if they ’re working in those settings . 
There ’s a real awareness now for everyone who ’s working in an active outbreak to look out for residents who present new symptoms and of course for any of those staff members who develop symptoms to be isolating , testing . 
So that ’s happening and that gives you a much greater sense of control . 
But it ’s fragile . "
