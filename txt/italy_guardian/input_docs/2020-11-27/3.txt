A study adds to evidence that people with type O or Rh*negative blood may be at slightly lower risk from the coronavirus . 
Among 225,556 Canadians who were tested for the virus , the risk for a Covid 19 diagnosis was 12 % lower and the risk for severe COVID 19 or death was 13 % lower in people with blood group O versus those with A , AB , or B , researchers reported in Annals of Internal Medicine . 
People in any blood group who were Rh negative were also somewhat protected , especially if they had O negative blood . 
People in these blood type groups may have developed antibodies that can recognize some aspect of the new virus , co author Dr Joel Ray of St . Michael â€™s Hospital in Toronto told Reuters . 
Our next study will specifically look at such antibodies , and whether they explain the protective effect , " Ray said .
