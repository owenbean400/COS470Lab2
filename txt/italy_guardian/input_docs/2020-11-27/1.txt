More than 1,300 people in England were wrongly told they had coronavirus due to a lab error with NHS Test and Trace . 
The Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) said 1,311 people who took a test between November 19-23 across the UK were incorrectly told they received a positive result . 
It said there was an issue with a batch of testing chemicals which meant their results were void . 
A DHSC spokesman said : " Swift action is being taken to notify those affected and they are being asked to take another test , and to continue to self isolate if they have symptoms . 
This laboratory error was an isolated incident and is being fully investigated to ensure this does not happen again . "
