In South Australia , the business sector has called for compensation amid ongoing coronavirus restrictions in the lead up to Christmas . 
As health officials continue to grapple with a worrying Covid 19 cluster , the state government is set to implement a two week , stepdown strategy in easing measures imposed at the start of the outbreak . 
But Business SA chief executive Martin Haese says this is not enough , and restrictions mean most businesses will be operating at 25 % capacity , which is not financially viable . 
He has reaffirmed calls for the government to relax the eligibility criteria for the $ 10,000 emergency grants to help businesses get through the Christmas period . 
South Australia recorded no news cases on Friday , after experiences a significant cluster and brief lockdown earlier in the month . 
In vaccine news , Australians have been told by the federal health minister they can still expect a coronavirus vaccine by March , despite ongoing testing on key candidates . 
Greg Hunt says Australia ’s vaccine time frame is unchanged , with expectations a safe and effective vaccine will begin being rolled out in March . 
" The data on all of the leading vaccines has been good , and I ’m looking forward to more positive news on other vaccines in coming weeks on preliminary briefings that we ’ve had , " he told reporters in Canberra on Friday . 
" Each day there ’s news and there ’s progress , and there will be ups and downs in the vaccine process . "
