Ferrari will seek assurances from Australian authorities that its staff will be allowed to travel and not face quarantine restrictions before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Grand Prix , which opens the Formula One season on 15 March . 
The Italian giant suspended non critical business travel and external access to its factory in Maranello , about 200km from the centre of the Italian outbreak in Codongo , on Wednesday . 
The Victorian sports minister Martin Pakula told The Guardian on Thursday that the event would go ahead , and the Australian Grand Prix corporation said it would comply with advice from the government and health authorities . 
But without Ferrari , the F1 would lose its biggest drawcard . 
Ferarri team principle Mattia Binotto raised the issue after his staff faced difficulties getting to the Bahrain F2 test this weekend . 
He said he would need confirmation from F1 and FIA officials that there would be " no surprises " before allowing staff to travel to Australia . 
He told Motorsport.com : What we will need is simply to have assurance before leaving . 
If there are any medical screenings , we need to know about them . 
You need to know exactly what ’s about . 
We need to understand what are the consequences in case of any problem ? 
Obviously we need to protect our employees . 
We have got collective and individual responsibility towards them . 
And it ’s important , really , to make sure that before leaving , the picture , whatever is the scenario , is known and clear . 
Binotto said with Ferrari providing assistance to Haas and Alfa Sauber as well as their own Alpha Tauri team , more than one team could be affected . 
What will be the situation that if eventually four teams cannot run and if the race will take place or not ? 
That is not my decision .
