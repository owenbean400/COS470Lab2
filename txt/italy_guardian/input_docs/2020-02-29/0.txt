On Friday the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee ( AHPPC ) issued a statement about the effectiveness of quarantine measures . 
It said over the past two weeks , direct connections between cases in other countries and China had decreased . 
It said the effectiveness of these quarantine measures and whether they remain adequate would be reviewed again in one week . 
The travel restrictions and self quarantine procedures for people coming from mainland China had been effective so far , with a more than 60 % reduction in travellers , and no cases detected in more than 30,000 Australians returning from mainland China since 1 February . 
The AHPPC statement said : The only new COVID 19 detections in Australia in the last two weeks are eight cases in Australian passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship . 
There remains no evidence of community transmission in Australia , with thousands of negative tests for COVID 19 in the last week alone . 
The risk to the Australian community from travellers from mainland China appears to have reduced significantly since the inception of travel restrictions . 
This could justify some further easing of travel restrictions .
