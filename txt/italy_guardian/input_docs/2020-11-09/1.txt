Italy will ramp up coronavirus restrictions in Tuscany and four other regions from Wednesday to rein in the second wave of the pandemic , a health ministry source said on Monday . 
Last week , the government imposed nationwide curbs including a nightly curfew , and divided the country into three zones based on the intensity of their Covid 19 outbreaks , calibrating additional limitations accordingly . 
Tuscany , which includes the cities of Florence and Siena ; 
Liguria ; 
Abruzzo ; 
Umbria and the southern Basilicata region are designated as " orange zones " where bars and restaurants are closed but shops remain open . 
People are free to move within their towns and cities but not leave them . 
The zoning depends on factors such as local infection rates and hospital occupancy . 
Milan and most of the industrial north are part of the " red zone " under a partial lockdown . 
The northern province of Bolzano will be added into the red zone , the source added . 
The southern regions of Puglia and Sicily were already part of the orange zone . 
Italy , the first European country hard hit by Covid 19 , tamed its outbreak after a rigid lockdown in March and April , but has toughened up its curbs once again following a resurgence in infections and deaths . 
On Monday , the country registered 25,271 new infections after 32,616 the day before , mainly due to a customary fall in daily tests on Sundays . 
Covid related deaths were 356 , the health ministry said . 
The steady surge in hospital admissions is straining the country ’s health system , and doctors warn that Italy could suffer some 10,000 fatalities in the next month on current trends . 
" The situation could become tragic ... 
We need drastic measures , such as a total lockdown , " said Filippo Anelli , the president of Italy ’s doctors ’ federation .
