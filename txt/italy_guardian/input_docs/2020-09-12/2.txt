Doctors have warned that bad air quality stemming from smoke produced by the wildfires ravaging western states in the US could make people more susceptible to getting infected with coronavirus , CNN reported . 
" Multiple studies have shown a correlation between higher levels of pollution in the air and greater spread and severity of Covid 19 cases , " said Dr Brad Spellberg , chief medical officer of the Los Angeles County USC Medical Center , citing several studies conducted in the US , China and Italy . 
" Some studies have also shown that exposure of lung tissue to pollution may increase susceptibility to viral infections . " 
Dr Rekha Murthy , an infectious disease specialist at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles , echoed Spellberg â€™s comments . 
" Whenever the lining of the lung or the airways become inflamed or damaged , it increases the potential for inhaled viral particles to take hold in the lungs and cause infection , " Murthy said .
