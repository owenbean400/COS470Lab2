Portugal ’s construction and manufacturing businesses are helping to get the economy back on its feet , Bloomberg reported . 
" The economy is recovering fast , better than expected both in Portugal and Europe , " finance minister Joao Leao said on Friday in Berlin , where he is attending a meeting of European finance ministers , but warned that the outlook was still " very uncertain " . 
In the third quarter Portugal ’s construction industry is " doing very well " and manufacturing is recovering , Leao said , but stressed tourism was still badly affected . 
The Portuguese economy is forecast to contract by 9.8 % this year , after six years of growth that helped cut the unemployment rate and reduce the budget deficit . 
Portugal has the third highest debt ratio in the eurozone behind Greece and Italy .
