Here ’s a little more detail on Conte ’s comments , which mark a step unprecedented in peacetime . 
He has told Italians : All shops will be closed apart from those for basic necessities , such as pharmacies and supermarkets . 
Industries can stay open , but with strict measures in place , as well as essential services such as banks . 
Transport will be guaranteed . 
Conte warned Italy ’s population not to " rush to the supermarkets " as shelves will be restocked as normal . 
The latest restrictions come two days after the Conte introduced emergency measures across the whole of Italy and urged people to " stay at home " as the government strives to contain the spread of the virus . 
As of Wednesday night , there were 10,590 current cases . 
Of that number , 5,763 are in Lombardy , with 560 of those in intensive care . 
The latest restrictions come after schools , universities , cultural sites , museums , theatres , cinemas and ski resorts were closed , and crowd drawing events such as concerts and sporting events banned . 
Just a few days ago I asked you to change your habits and stay at home , and you have responded in an extraordinary way . 
You are making enormous sacrifices , I know that ’s not easy , but these [ sacrifices ] are making a great and precious contribution to the country . 
The whole world is watching us , especially watching the number of cases . 
Conte said the impact of the stringent measures would only be clear " in a few weeks " . 
" If we all respect these rules , the quicker we will overcome this . "
