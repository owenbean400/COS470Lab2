Rhode Island , the smallest US state , was able to reopen day care programs in the summer without high rates of coronavirus spread , a study said . 
Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which wrote the research , held it up as an example that could be replicated across the country . 
" I think this is an inspiring article to tell individuals that there is a path where one can use or partner with their public health authorities and safely get these childcare programs reopened , " he said . 
A total of 666 out of 891 childcare programs , both center - and home based , reopened in Rhode Island on June 1 following a significant decline in cases and hospitalisations in the state . 
Officials imposed measures like universal masking for adults , daily symptom screening for everyone , routine disinfection , reduced class sizes ( first up to 12 , and later 20 ) , and maintaining stable bubbles of staff and children .
