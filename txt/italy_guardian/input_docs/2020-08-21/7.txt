Hi , Josh Taylor here taking over the blog . 
We have some more information on the Queensland Covid 19 outbreak . 
In addition to the limitations on the number of guests , aged care facilities and disability accomodations services in the Greater Brisbane area will not be allowed to have guests . 
People working in hospitals and the emergency departments will be required to wear personal protective equipment for every patient they see . 
One of the people who tested positive worked for Qbuild and was working at the Springwood School . 
It is not clear whether the school will open on Monday . 
Another man who worked at the centre also worked in a disability accomodation service , and a relative of that man worked at the Ipswich hospital . 
There were 9,447 tests conducted in the past 24 hours in Queensland .
