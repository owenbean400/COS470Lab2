Fifteen Minnesota residents have contracted the coronavirus after being exposed during the 10 day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota , health officials said , warning that they expect the number to grow . 
One patient was hospitalised as of Friday , said Kris Ehresmann , infectious disease director at the Minnesota Department of Health . 
The first Sturgis linked case was reported Thursday , she said , while the 14 others were added on Friday . 
" We ’re expecting that were going to see many more cases associated with Sturgis , " Ehresmann said . 
" Thousands of people attended that event , and so it ’s very likely that we ’ll see more transmission . 
Obviously it takes a while for people to develop symptoms and get tested and for us to get those results . " 
The Sturgis rally , which ended Sunday , brought hundreds of thousands of people to western South Dakota .
