British holidaymakers have endured long last minute drives and forked out thousands of pounds in a bid to return home from Croatia before the imposition of new travel quarantine rules . 
From 4am on Saturday travellers arriving to the UK from the Mediterranean country will have to self isolate for 14 days after a spike in coronavirus cases led to the British government removing Croatia from its safe travel list . 
At London Heathrow Airport ’s Terminal 5 on Friday evening , British Airways flights arriving from the Croatian city of Dubrovnik and the capital Zagreb were among the last to arrive in the UK before the quarantine deadline . 
Adam and Katie Marlow , from Buckinghamshire , were forced to drive a hire car three hours from the coastal city of Zadar to Zagreb to catch a new flight home instead of returning on Saturday . 
The couple decided to come back earlier than planned due to 33 year old Ms Marlow ’s pregnancy and her need to return to work on Monday . 
They said their new flights costs around 300 , while the care hire was another 100 . 
Asked about the government ’s handling of the travel corridor rules , Mr Marlow , 37 , who works for a financial company , said : " With most of the changes I support everything they do , I would say though that they should publish the criteria for where the cases are . 
" Then we could have kept have an eye on it ... and we could have maybe made a different decision and maybe an earlier decision and it might have cost us a bit less money . " 
Mrs Marlow , a sales manager , who is due in October , added : " Completely understand why they are doing it , but it would be good to have a bit more warning , because we only had 24 hours notice . 
That ’s all we had . " 
Steve Laws , 53 , a company director from Oxfordshire branded the government ’s actions as " shambolic " .
