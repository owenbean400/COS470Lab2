Barack Obama ridiculed Donald Trump at a Florida rally for the president ’s complaints about the media closely covering the national coronavirus crisis . 
The 44th president has recently abandoned traditional decorum where a former president refrains from publicly criticising his successor , lambasting the 45th president in recent speeches for his response to the coronavirus pandemic , in particular . 
At a drive in rally in Orlando to boost support for his former vice president and now Democratic nominee for the White House , Joe Biden , Obama took a tone combining mockery of Trump with indignation . 
He spoke of record numbers dying of coronavirus in the US and asked rhetorically of the president : " What is his closing argument ? " with the election just a week away . 
" That people are too focused on Covid . 
He said this at one of his rallies ‘ Covid , Covid , Covid ’ , he is complaining . 
He is jealous of Covid ’s media coverage , " Obama said with mock incredulity as the crowd laughed . 
At a rally on Saturday in North Carolina , Trump did say those words and complained that the media was paying too much attention to coronavirus , even as he claimed record case numbers are exaggerated and downplayed the death rates . 
Obama said : If he had been focused on Covid from the beginning , cases would not be reaching record highs across the country this week , the White House would not be having its second outbreak in a month . 
Staff working for Mike Pence , the vice president , have come down with Covid , it was revealed at the weekend , just a few weeks after Trump , his wife and youngest son all had coronavirus and multiple prominent people tested positive after the event at the White House to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court .
