The US airline Delta has announced the first " quarantine free " transatlantic flights , with pre departure Covid testing enabling passengers to escape 14 days ’ isolation on arrival in Italy . 
The trial flights will start next month between Atlanta and Rome , the first of the type of transatlantic corridor that UK airlines have been seeking to establish to open up travel on their most lucrative routes . 
Passengers must test negative three times : first , a PCR test will be taken in the 72 hours prior to departure , then a rapid test before boarding in Atlanta , and a further rapid test on arrival at Fiumicino airport in Rome . 
The trial , starting on relaunched services from 19 December , will open up Italy to US citizens permitted to travel for essential reasons , such as work , health and education . 
Returning citizens must take a rapid test at Rome Fiumicino before departure to the US , which has barred foreign nationals from flying in from the EU . 
Delta ’s president , Steve Sear , said such tests were the " best path for resuming international travel safely and without quarantine until vaccinations are widely in place " .
