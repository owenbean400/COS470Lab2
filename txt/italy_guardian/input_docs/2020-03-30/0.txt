About a third of workers at an Amazon delivery site in central Italy have gone on strike , a union representative says , citing a request for enhanced safety measures . 
A company representative has claimed activity at the site in Calenzano , near Florence , has not been affected and said it had already cut deliveries and stepped up safety measures to protect both its direct employees and independent couriers . 
Around 300 people work at the site , more than two thirds of them independent couriers delivering parcels for the world â€™s largest online retailer .
