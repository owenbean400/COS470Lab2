Sweden remains steadfast in its strategy of voluntary measures and no lockdowns , the architect of its unorthodox Covid 19 response said on Friday , as the country experienced a record number of daily infections , Reuters reports . 
More than 6,000 Swedes have died in the country of 10 million people . 
Its soft touch approach to combating the virus has drawn worldwide attention - and harsh domestic criticism from some - and there has been a surge in the number of cases , hospitalisations and deaths in recent weeks . 
At 5,990 , the number of new cases reported on Friday was the highest since the start of the pandemic . 
A further 42 deaths were also recorded , the most for around three months . 
The strategy , however , will not change . 
" No , we will keep on this path , " the chief epidemiologist , Anders Tegnell , told Reuters in a telephone interview on Friday . 
" This is how we work in Sweden . 
We have big understanding for this and a huge adherence to the rules . " 
In contrast to many other countries , Sweden has kept schools , restaurants and other businesses open throughout the pandemic . 
Instead , it has focused on voluntary measures aimed at promoting social distancing and good hygiene , such as working from home if possible , avoiding public transport and crowded indoor activities . 
While Sweden â€™s death rate per capita is lower than in countries such as Spain and Britain , it is more than 10 times higher than neighbouring Norway and almost five times higher than in Denmark .
