Requiring the wearing of masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus in areas at the epicenter of the global pandemic may have prevented tens of thousands of infections , a new study suggests . 
Mask wearing is even more important for preventing the virus â€™ spread than social distancing and stay at home orders , researchers said in the study published in PNAS : The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA . 
Infection trends shifted dramatically when mask wearing rules were implemented on April 6 in northern Italy and April 17 in New York City - at the time among the hardest hit areas of the world by the health crisis - the study found . 
" This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections , that is , by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9 , " researchers calculated . 
When mask wearing went into effect in New York , the daily new infection rate fell by about 3 % per day , researchers said . 
In the rest of the country , daily new infections continued to increase .
