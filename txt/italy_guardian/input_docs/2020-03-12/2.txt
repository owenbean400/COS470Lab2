Former Health Secretary and current Chairman of the Health Select Committee Jeremy Hunt was interviewed on Channel 4 News earlier this evening about the UK ’s response to coronavirus . 
Hunt challenged the logic of delaying social distancing measures , saying " I ’m surprised we ’re not moving sooner " . 
" The places that have succeeded are the ones that moved earliest to social distancing . . . I think people will be concerned that we ’re not moving sooner to more social distancing , for example banning external visits to care homes . " 
" I am concerned because we ’ve got four weeks , We ’re four weeks behind Italy and what we do every single day of those four weeks is absolutely critical . 
I do not want to second guess the advice that scientists are giving but I would like to see what the modelling is from the behavioural scientists that says we can go too early with some of these measures because I think most peoples priority is their elderly loved ones who are most vulnerable . " 
In what was a remarkably frank interview , Hunt said there was " all to play for " in the coming weeks and described the announcement today to delay social distancing measures as " puzzling " .
