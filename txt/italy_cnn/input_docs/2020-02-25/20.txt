Italian authorities have identified what they believe is the first known patient to have caught coronavirus in Italy 's northern Lombardy region as a 38 year old man called Mattia . 
Mattia was originally in intensive care for respiratory problems at a hospital in Codogno , but is now at the Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia , about 35 kilometers south of Milan , Italian Civil Protection press officer Juri Pittaluga told CNN . 
Authorities do not believe that this is the case that imported the virus to the region , however . 
Mattia 's pregnant wife , called Valentina , has also tested positive for coronavirus and is in the Sacco hospital in Milan , but her health condition is " not worrying at all " Pittaluga told CNN .
