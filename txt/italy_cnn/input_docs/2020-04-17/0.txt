French President Emmanuel Macron warned of an EU " moment of truth " regarding financial solidarity amid the coronavirus crisis , in an interview with the Financial Times published Friday . 
" We are at a moment of truth , which is whether the European Union is a political project or a market project only , " Macron said from the Elys√©e Palace . 
Macron said there was " no choice " but to set up a fund that " could issue common debt with a common guarantee " to finance member states according to their needs rather than the size of their economies . 
This is an idea that Germany and the Netherlands have so far rejected . 
He said the lack of EU solidarity could fuel populist anger in southern Europe , especially in member states hit hard by coronavirus . 
" If we ca not do this today , I tell you the populists will win ... today , tomorrow , the day after , in Italy , in Spain , perhaps in France and elsewhere , " Macron added .
