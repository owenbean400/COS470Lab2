Italy is set to tighten Covid 19 restrictions , but is stopping short from introducing a full lockdown , Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday as infections and hospitalizations surge in the country . 
The new measures will include a nighttime curfew and travel restrictions between the worst hit regions , in an effort to contain a second wave of the virus . 
The restrictions will be included in a government decree expected to be issued by the end of the week . 
Conte also said the country would be divided into three areas depending on the level of contagion and the number of hospitalizations , with the most affected areas facing tighter restrictions . 
Distance learning will also become compulsory for high schools . 
In a tweet on Monday , Pope Francis said : " Today we pray for all the # Faithful Departed and especially for the victims of the # Coronavirus : for those who have died alone , without the caress of their loved ones ; and for those who have given their lives serving the sick . "
