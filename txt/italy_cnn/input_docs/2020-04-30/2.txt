The Italian government will slowly relax the coronavirus lockdown measures based on how the contagion spreads in different regions of the country , Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said today . 
" Reopening of activities would be based on precise scientific criteria , " he said during an address to Parliament . 
Conte 's comments come as 13 out of the 20 Italian regions have asked the government to reopen certain activities , through a joint letter delivered on Wednesday . 
Lombardy , the region affected most by the coronavirus outbreak , is one of the signatories . 
The letter , published by the governor of Veneto , asks the government " to guarantee the possibility of reopening activities to all those who respect the measures already provided " by the government decree . 
" It 's clear that health is the first essential objective , but it ca not be the only one , " the letter read . 
Restaurants , bars , and shop owners around Italy are " handing over their keys " to their mayors in protest against the government . 
Many shop owners fear that the longer the lockdown will last , the harder it will be to reopen . 
On Thursday , the Italian Health Minister is expected to publish a series of measures defining the guidelines and thresholds to evaluate the evolution of the contagion in each area of Italy .
