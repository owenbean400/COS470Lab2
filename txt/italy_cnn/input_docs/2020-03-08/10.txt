Thailand will now require travelers from South Korea , China , Iran and Italy to self quarantine for 14 days and report their health daily to authorities , Thanarak Plipat , Thailand 's Deputy Director General of the Department of Disease Control , said at a press briefing . 
Thais or foreigners who have traveled from those four countries will be asked to register their information with Thailand 's Ministry of Public Health ( MOPH ) . 
They will then need to give daily check ins over the 14 days , which can be done via an app . 
" They can tell their daily conditions if they have any fever , cough or sore throat . 
If they have we can quickly get in and take care of them . 
They have to report themselves every day , " Plipat said . 
If they fail to do so , a state mandatory quarantine can be enforced , Plipat said . 
Those who fail to report or who report false information can be punished under the Communicable Disease Act . 
Under the current act , anyone aware of people suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus is required to inform communicable disease control officials within three hours . 
Violators are fined up to 20,000 baht ( $ 4,949 ) . 
In addition , all travelers must self isolate and not go outside , by either staying at home or if they are tourists , staying in their hotels or temporary accommodation for 14 days , Plipat added . 
" If they are willing to cooperate , there should not be any issue , " Plipat said .
