A soccer match in Italy was delayed after the country 's sport minister called for the suspension of all Serie A games due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
Vincenzo Spadafora posted a statement on Facebook saying it did not make sense for matches in Italy 's top flight league to continue while the country struggles to contain the virus . 
The news sparked confusion with the game between Parma and Spal just minutes from kick off . 
Players were already in the tunnel and about to walk onto the pitch but were requested to return to the dressing room by the referee . 
The match at the Ennio Tardini Stadium eventually kicked off 75 minutes later .
