The Italian Cabinet is discussing a draft proposal that could put people in the region of Lombardy and 11 other provinces in northern Italy under complete lockdown due to coronavirus , according to a close adviser to one of the ministers attending a Cabinet meeting . 
The text of the draft proposal – also sent to CNN by the press office of the Lombardy regional authority – says that people in Lombardy and the other 11 provinces should " absolutely avoid any movement into and out ... as well as within the same territories ... except for travel motivated by unavoidable working needs or situations of emergency . " 
The draft says the police , the fire brigade and armed forces could be used to enforce these measures . 
The measures also could include : Schools and universities being suspended until April 3 . 
All sporting events in those regions being suspended , with the exception of professional events . 
No spectators would be allowed at those professional events . 
People in places of prayer standing 1 meter away from each other . 
Bars and restaurants enforcing social distancing . 
Medical staff not being allowed to take a leave of absence . 
It 's unclear when or if these measure would actually be implemented , because the proposal is still being discussed and the terms could change . 
It could impact more than 10 million people in Italy .
