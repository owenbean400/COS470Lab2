A man from Winter Springs , Florida , told CNN on Monday that he has been stuck on a cruise ship and then a hospital ship in an Italian port for 62 days after testing positive for Covid 19 in early April . 
Grimes set sail mid January from Genoa , Italy , on his second cruise as an employee of MSC Cruises , a global cruise company headquartered in Geneva , Switzerland . 
Grimes worked in the jewelry store on their Mediterranean route . 
On March 17 , a friend of Grimes and fellow employee tested positive for Covid 19 , Grimes said . 
After consulting with the ship doctor and captain , Grimes said he " voluntarily went into isolation . " 
Fifteen days later , he also tested positive , Grimes said . 
Grimes has since been tested seven more times and has received a mixture of positive and negative results , he said . 
Grimes said he hopes his eighth Covid 19 test result will be negative , so he can return to the United States . 
The American Embassy confirmed to the family it is Italian policy that cruise ship employees may not be released from a ship until they have tested negative in two subsequent tests , Ann Grimes said . 
" We do not question that that 's the standard , " Ann Grimes said . 
" It 's the fact the testing is so sketchy . 
How can you be in quarantine for 62 consecutive days and still be testing positive ? "
