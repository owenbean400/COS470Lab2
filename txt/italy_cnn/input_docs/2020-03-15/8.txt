During his walk the Pope visited " two important pilgrimage sites in Rome to pray for the city and the world , " the release said . 
The first site is the ancient icon of Maria Salus Populi Romani at the Basilica of St . Mary Major , and the other at the foot of a wooden crucifix that protected Rome from a great plague .
