Illinois Gov . 
J.B . Pritzker has been critical of the long lines at airports , specifically at Chicago 's O 'Hare International Airport , as Americans rush home amid recent travel restrictions due to the coronavirus . 
Pritzker tweeted , " to the frustrated people trying to get home , I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this . 
We will do everything within our power to get relief . " 
Pritzker was on NBC ’s " Meet the Press " this morning where he discussed the travel restrictions discussed Saturday by Vice President Mike Pence . 
Pence announced that travel from the United Kingdom and Ireland will be suspended starting Monday night . 
This is in addition to the previous US ban applying to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone : Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Italy , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , The Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Sweden and Switzerland . 
Pritzker added : " So last night , as people were flooding into O ’Hare airport , they were stuck in a small area . 
Hundreds and hundreds of people . 
And that 's exactly what you do not want in this pandemic . 
So we had that problem . 
And then today , it 's going to be even worse . 
There are a larger number of flights with more people coming . 
And they seem completely unprepared . " 
To help relieve the situation today , the governor said he has been talking to Customs and Border Patrol officials directly on the ground at O ’Hare .
