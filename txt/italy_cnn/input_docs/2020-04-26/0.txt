Several Italian mafia bosses have been released from prison under a new coronavirus regulation , the country 's national anti mafia prosecutor said . 
Francesco Bonura , an influential boss in the Sicilian Cosa Nostra ; 
Vincenzo Iannazzo , a member of the Ndrangheta ; and Pasquale Zagaria , a member of the Casalesi clan , have been moved to house arrest , according to Federico Cafiero De Raho , Italy 's anti mafia prosecutor . 
To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus within correctional facilities , the Italian government authorized magistrates to transfer inmates with 18 months or less left in their sentences to house arrest . 
Cafiero De Raho said the three men had been held under " extra isolation measures " to avoid contact with people outside the prison because of the roles they had in mafia organizations . 
" Once they are sent back home , these measures are obviously no longer enforced , " the prosecutor added .
