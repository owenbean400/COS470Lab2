Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced Sunday that the country 's funeral ban will be lifted on May 4 . 
Speaking at a press conference , Conte confirmed that funerals will be allowed -- preferably outdoors -- with a maximum of 15 family members in attendance , adding that he understands " the suffering of not being able to exercise freedom of worship . " 
He went on to say that other religious ceremonies will require the approval of the scientific committee . 
In a statement , Italian Bishops complained , saying that the Prime Minister 's decree " arbitrarily excludes the possibility of celebrating Mass with the people . " 
" In the next few days , a protocol will be studied which will allow the faithful to participate in liturgical celebrations as soon as possible in conditions of maximum safety , " the Prime Minister 's office said in response .
