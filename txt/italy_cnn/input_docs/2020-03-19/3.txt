Germany is extending its entry restrictions at six national borders to air and shipping traffic , the interior ministry said late Wednesday . 
EU citizens coming from Austria , Spain , Italy , Switzerland , Luxembourg and Denmark will no longer be allowed into Germany by air or sea unless there is an " urgent reason to travel , " said the interior ministry in a statement . 
Travelers coming from EU countries may only land at a German airport if they are traveling from their original destination to their home country . 
Germany had imposed the land border closures with those six countries earlier this week . 
Earlier today , German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the public : She asked all citizens to play their part in containing the pandemic .
