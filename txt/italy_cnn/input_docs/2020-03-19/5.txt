Officials in the Austrian province of Tyrol have ordered 279 communities to isolate themselves and go into quarantine as an extension of federal lockdown measures . 
" We have to prevent with all our strength conditions like what we are seeing now in Italy ... we are issuing a quarantine order for all 279 Tyrolean communities , " Governor Guenther Platter announced Wednesday evening in a statement shared on Facebook . 
Platter said that members of the public would only be allowed to leave their villages or towns if necessary to cover basic needs , provide services of general interest or travel to work . 
According to Austria 's Federal Ministry for Social Affairs , Health Care and Consumer Protection , the western province has reported 437 cases -- out of Austria 's total 1,843 -- as of Thursday morning . 
The order for the popular tourist region follows previous quarantine measures imposed on ski resorts across Austria -- including Ischgl and St Anton -- which had been identified by authorities as hotspots for the spread of the coronavirus .
