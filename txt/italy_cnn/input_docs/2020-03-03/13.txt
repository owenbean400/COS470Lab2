The World Health Organization has seen a steady decline in novel coronavirus cases in China since the end of January , including in Hubei province and the city of Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak . 
She said they believe this because of the extent of case finding , contact tracing and testing among other surveillance systems . 
Van Kerkhove did not say whether the virus has peaked in China . 
" We ’ve seen the comprehensive measures that China has taken and … we believe that that has had an impact on changing the natural trajectory of the outbreak in China , " she said . 
" We believe that this is possible in other countries . " 
For countries other than China – including Italy , Iran and Korea – that means having an aggressive approach to looking for contacts , social distancing , hand washing , respiratory etiquette and readying systems , she said .
