Police in Italy say they are concerned about criminal organizations , or Mafia , infiltrating " basic needs " sectors of industry and society under financial pressure during the coronavirus lockdown . 
" The danger is high because mafia organizations have already started investing in sectors that are still essential during the Covid 19 lockdown : the agriculture food chain , the supply of medicines and medical equipment , road transport , funeral services , cleaning , sanitation and waste disposal companies " , the head of Italian Police , Franco Gabrielli said . 
These are sectors that do not require a lot of specialization , so " criminal groups can easily be able to offer services at competitive prices because the companies they control do not comply with environmental , social security and safety at work regulations . " 
According to Gabrielli , mafia organizations , in particular the ‘ most dangerous ’ of them , the ‘ Ndrangheta , " could finance the liquidity crisis of large companies , but also of small and medium sized enterprises , which may not be able to meet their payments due to the lockdown . " 
By the end of the emergency lockdown , the criminal associations could have polluted the economy , controlling companies previously not infiltrated , " he warns .
