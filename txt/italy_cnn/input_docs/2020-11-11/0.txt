The world has come to depend on antibody tests to check whether someone 's already had Covid 19 , but a study in the town where the virus first spread in Italy shows that these tests are not completely reliable . 
A different test -- one that looks for an immune cell , called a T cell -- was more effective , according to the study . 
" This makes sense . 
It 's well known that antibodies wane , but T cells have immunological memory , " said Dr . Peter Hotez , an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine . 
In the study , researchers in Italy , the United Kingdom and the United States studied people in Vo , Italy , to learn more about testing accuracy . 
They conducted blood tests on 70 people who had had confirmed cases of coronavirus about two months earlier . 
Theoretically , all 70 of them should have had positive results on an antibody test . 
But the antibody test returned negative results in 16 of the cases , or 23 % . 
The T cell test missed only 2 cases , or about 3 % . 
The researchers also tested 2,200 people who had tested negative for Covid 19 . 
Of those , the T cell test returned positive results for 45 of them .
