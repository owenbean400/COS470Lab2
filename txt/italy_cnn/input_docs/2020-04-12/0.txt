Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte says this Easter is like none other because of the coronavirus outbreak . 
Conte shared his sympathy to those affected by the crisis in an Easter message on Facebook . 
" To those who suffer today , to those who have an empty chair in front of them , to those who struggle in the hospital wards to remove tears and pain from their community , " he said . 
He said that while this Easter is different , we will get through this together . 
" Today will not be like the other times , and tomorrow wo not be either , when we hold on to what we care about . 
Together we will do it , " Conte said . 
Italy has reported more than 19,000 coronavirus deaths , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University .
