Hospitals battling Italy 's growing coronavirus outbreak are facing a " crisis , " according to health officials in the southern European nation . 
Italy now has over 820 cases , making it one of the worst hit countries in the world . 
Lombardy , in northern Italy , has 531 confirmed cases and a death toll of 17 , the region 's health secretary Giulio Gallera said Friday . 
And hospitals are struggling to cope . 
Professor Massimo Galli , head of the department of infectious diseases at Sacco Hospital in Milan , said that some hospitals were already facing an overcrowding crisis . 
The strain on health care infrastructure has long been a concern attached to the outbreak . 
In the Chinese province of Hubei , where the virus is thought to have originated , hospitals were initially unable to cope with the influx of new patients , a situation that is thought to have helped accelerate the spread of the virus during the early stages of the outbreak .
