The pizzerias of Naples are back in business , now Italy has entered the second phase of relaxing its lockdown restrictions . 
They can only do take away and home delivery , but it 's a small , hopeful step back to normalcy in the city that prides itself as the birthplace of pizza . 
As one owner told CNN : " The pizzeria is the Neapolitans ' soul , and the pizza maker is an author , an artist . " 
Now , the artists are back at work . 
Elsewhere in Italy , pizzerias had continued to provide home delivery throughout the country 's lockdown , but the no nonsense governor of the Campania region , where Naples is located , was not willing to take risks in the relatively poor , crowded city , and ordered all pizzerias to close . 
Now Napolitani can be reunited with their beloved pizza .
