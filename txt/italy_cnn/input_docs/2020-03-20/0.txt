If you think you have a ruptured appendix , you break your leg , you do not know if you 'll be able to go to the doctor . 
Our dentists are closed , doctors are closed . 
We have no medical care right now . 
Unless it is on a real emergency basis . 
Even then , people are afraid that if they go into an emergency room that they will contract the virus , " Nadeau said . 
Staying home : " It is time to rip off the band aid and make everyone stay at home . 
People are walking their dogs , but you see the same dog with 4 or 5 different people through the day . 
In the grocery store , people are buying one banana , or sack of potatoes at the time . 
People are not necessarily thinking the way they need to be thinking . "
