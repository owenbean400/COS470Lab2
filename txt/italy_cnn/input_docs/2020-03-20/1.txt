CNN 's Anderson Cooper and Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta speak to Mike Ryan , director of the World Health Organization 's Health Emergencies Program about the US ' capacity to test for the coronavirus and do contact tracing . 
Learning from Italy : " I think other countries really , really need to step up and learn the lessons that are being learned in Italy right now . 
We have to push this virus back . 
It 's not just enough to do social distancing . 
It 's good to have that , it 's great to separate people , but we have to be able to go after the virus , " Ryan said . 
Tailoring responses : " You 've got 50 states . 
You 've got a different situation in each of those states . 
And you need to tailor the responses in each of those states . 
And if you 've got a chance you need to go after the virus . 
And contact tracing and isolation of cases is still a strategy that can be used , " Ryan said . 
Question on problems with testing in US : " If you do not test people , you do not know they 're positive . 
Therefore , they may be positive and you do not have time to contact trace them because you do not know they have it , " Cooper said . 
Need to identify cases : " It 's really important we identify all confirmed cases . 
We need to test suspected cases . 
We need those cases to be isolated , and it is difficult in a very intense environment . 
It 's difficult to do the kind of detailed contact tracing . 
In Ebola , at the peak of the outbreak , we were tracing 25,000 contacts a day in the middle of a war zone . 
It is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances , but it does require a real scale up in public health capacity . 
And where that can be done and the virus can be pushed back , we can save lives , " Ryan said .
