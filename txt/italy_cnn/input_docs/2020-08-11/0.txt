Bars and restaurants around the world are having to rethink the way they interact with customers during the pandemic . 
In the Italian city of Florence , some are looking to the past : using centuries old wine windows to dole out food and drinks . 
Rising just above ground level , blink and you might miss these tiny openings , called " buchette del vino , " ( literally " little wine holes " ) in Italian . 
The small windows were used to sell wine to go during the Renaissance period , and were intended to be cheaper , direct to consumer alternatives to taverns and other drinking dens -- not to mention a discreet way for merchants to avoid paying taxes on the alcoholic libations they were peddling . 
Those merchants were Florence 's elites , many of whom had the foot tall windows built into street facing walls of their palatial residences , usually next to the main entrance . 
Back in the 1500s , a number of the city 's aristocrats were also major wine producers in the surrounding countryside . 
The " buchette " allowed them to trade ( or rather , have servants do it for them ) their spirits straight from their in house cellars to basically anyone , with a reduced need for physical contact . 
In May , as Italy eased its two months long lockdown , several F&B businesses in Florence , who happened to be based in premises with existing buchette , decided to reopen them , capitalizing on the design 's minimal contact aspect . 
Wine , Aperol spritzes , ice creams and sandwiches have since been served through the holes , at a safe distance .
