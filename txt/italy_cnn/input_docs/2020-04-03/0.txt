Dr . Deborah Birx said she can tell by looking at the US curve of coronavirus cases that not every American is following the guidelines set out by the administration for people to stay home and be vigilant about washing their hands . 
Birx , who serves as the task force 's response coordinator , said " I know you ’ve seen the slope on the US versus the slope in Italy , and we have to change that slope , " adding , " What it means in the US is not everyone is doing it . " 
" So we ’re only as strong as every community , every county , every state , every American following the guidelines to a T , " Birx said . 
" And I can tell by the curve … that not every American is following it . "
