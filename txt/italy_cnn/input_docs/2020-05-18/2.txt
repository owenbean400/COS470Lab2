Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro joined a large rally outside his official residence , the Alvorada Palace , in Brasilia on Sunday to greet supporters , according to video posted on his official social media accounts . 
Video streamed on Bolsonaro 's You Tube page showed him wearing a face mask while walking close to a large crowd . 
At least four ministers accompanied Bolsonaro as he shook hands with those in the crowd and even carried several children in his arms . 
Bolsonaro addressed the media during the rally , saying " it is very gratifying , honorable for me , for my cabinet , to receive a demonstration of support in this sense . " 
" We will be able to change the fate of Brazil , despite this crisis that has been affecting the whole world , " Bolsonaro added . 
Shortly after the rally , Bolsonaro welcomed a group of men wearing military outfits at the Presidential Palace . 
The men said they were paratroopers from the Brazilian army , and wanted to show support for Bolsonaro . 
The group said a prayer for Brazil , at one point shouting " Bolsonaro is us . " 
They also did several rounds of push ups with the Brazilian President . 
The demonstration took place just hours after Sao Paulo 's mayor , Bruno Covas , warned that his city 's health system is on the brink of collapse due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The country 's Ministry of Health has so far reported 241,080 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 16,118 deaths . 
Brazil has the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases in the world , according to data from Johns Hopkins University in the US . 
The latest spike in cases pushed Brazil 's count past Spain and Italy .
