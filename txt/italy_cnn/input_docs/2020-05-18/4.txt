The next few months will be " very hard " but " we will do everything we can to help everyone " , Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a letter to Italians published Monday in the daily newspaper Leggo . 
On Monday , in most Italian regions bars , restaurants , retail stores , hairdressers and museums reopened after nearly 10 weeks of lockdown , as the badly hit European country entered the so called " Phase 2 " of its coronavirus restrictions . 
Such measures include social distancing and the use of masks in public spaces and on public transportation . 
Gyms and sport centres will be allowed to reopen from May 25 , while from June 3 people will be permitted to travel outside their region of residence . 
On Saturday , the prime minister announced that if the number of coronavirus cases keep decreasing , the government will allow people to enter Italy from abroad starting June 3 . 
Each Italian region will be able to decide whether to extend or restrict such measures , based on the assessments of the epidemiological data of their territories , the government said in a statement Saturday .
