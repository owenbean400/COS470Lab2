Billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros has said that coronavirus threatens the survival of the European Union ( EU ) unless the bloc takes action to raise its budget and provide financial relief to its hardest hit nations . 
" Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures , " Soros said in an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf published Friday . 
" Perpetual bonds or consols are such a measure . 
They should not even be considered in normal times . 
But if the EU is unable to consider it now , it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts . 
This is not a theoretical possibility ; it may be the tragic reality . " 
The billionaire added that the EU could provide perpetual bonds by authorising taxation in order to issue them , as the bloc would need to maintain its AAA rating for the idea to work . 
Soros suggested that the money raised could be allocated to those in the greatest need , especially the hardest hit Southern countries . 
He was particularly concerned about Italy , which he said had been treated unfairly by the EU and Germany in the past . 
Soros said he expected the damage suffered by the Eurozone economy due to the virus to last longer than most people think it will .
