More than 40 % of people infected with coronavirus in a small village in northern Italy had no symptoms during a coronavirus outbreak earlier this year , an international team of researchers reported Tuesday . 
Yet the people without symptoms had virtually the same viral load – that ’s the amount of virus in their systems – as people who did have symptoms , the researchers wrote in a pre print , non peer reviewed report published in the journal Nature . 
The team tested most of the residents of Vo after an outbreak forced a two week lockdown of the village in February . 
They found 42.5 % of people with confirmed Covid 19 infections were asymptomatic , meaning they " did not have symptoms at the time of the swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterward , " researchers Enrico Lavezzo and Elisa Franchin of the University of Padova in Italy and colleagues across Europe wrote . 
" On the first survey , which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started , we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6 % , they wrote . 
" On the second survey , which was conducted at the end of the lockdown , we found a prevalence of 1.2 % . " 
This is the first definitive assessment of the rate of asymptomatic infection in Covid 19 cases since the pandemic began , Lavezzo and Franchin ’s team said . 
" This figure is of enormous value as it informs estimates and decisions regarding the further dealing with the epidemic in many countries , " they wrote .
