Italy has not reached the peak of coronavirus contagion , director of Italy 's National Health Institute Silvio Brusaferro said Friday during a press conference . 
Brusaferro said that Italy " has not reached the peak [ of contagion ] , we have signs that the curve is slowing down which make us assume that we are close to this . 
We expect that we could reach the peak these coming days . 
We are not in a descending phase , but the growth is slowing down . " 
" If we had to decide today , I consider inevitable the extension of the measures , because we are not in a markedly declining phase , we are still in a containment phase , " Franco Locatelli , president of the National Health institute said referring to the government containment measure that are in force till April 3 . 
Both Locatelli and Brusaferro are part of the technical and scientific committee that advises the government on the measures to take to stop the spread of the virus .
