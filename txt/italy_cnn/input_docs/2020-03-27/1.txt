With the growing number of coronavirus cases , California is the next New York and New York is the next Italy , Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters Thursday . 
" In the same way that New York is now the next Italy , and Italy is the next Iran , and Iran is the next China , no matter where you live , you are the next next , this virus does not care where you live , " said Mayor Garcetti , echoing comments he previously made to CNN . 
The rate of increase in the number of cases was doubling every three to four days , but today â€™s number shows a new rate of increase . 
Cases are now doubling less than every two days and if this rate continues , we will be where New York is today , Garcetti said . 
" These are neighbors , these are not statistics . 
These are the loved ones that are in our families and our communities and our workplaces , " Garcetti added . 
The mayor also announced that the city is partnering with fashion brand Reformation to help produce masks with guidance from health care company Kaiser Permanente . 
The city has launched LA Projects to collaborate with garment and apparel manufacturers to mass produce non medical masks for non medical staff at hospitals , grocery workers , and other Angelenos on the front lines . 
The goal is to produce 5 million non medical masks , Garcetti said .
