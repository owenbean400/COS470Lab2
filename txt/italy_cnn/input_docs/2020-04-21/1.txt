The planned docking of the world â€™s last major cruise ship remaining at sea was scuttled by rough seas Tuesday , the port authority of Genoa , Italy , said . 
The Costa Deliziosa is now anchored just outside the port , officials said . 
" The captain decided not to dock this afternoon given the sea conditions . 
The ship is located about 7 km from the coast and the docking was scheduled for this afternoon . 
It is unlikely that the ship will dock before tomorrow morning , " the port authority operations room told CNN . 
Costa Deliziosa has 1,519 remaining guests and 898 crew on board . 
No cases of coronavirus have been reported cases on board the ship , a statement to CNN from Costa Cruises said Tuesday . 
Other than that ship , the Cruise Lines International Association ( CLIA ) says there are no major cruise ships with passengers at sea anywhere in the world . 
Some context : The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in the United States issued a " no sail order " for cruise ships on March 14 in order to fight the spread of coronavirus . 
The original 30 day order was extended effective April 15 . 
The CDC said CLIA voluntarily complied with the order .
