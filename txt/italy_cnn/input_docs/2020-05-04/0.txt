France will not impose a 14 day quarantine on travelers from the Schengen area of the European Union or the UK , the Elysée Palace confirmed to CNN on Sunday . 
This is regardless of the nationality of those traveling to France . 
Sunday ’s statement appears to be a direct contradiction of health minister Olivier Véran ’s statement a day earlier of a proposed measure to quarantine all people entering France from " abroad , Corsica and other overseas territory . " 
The French government will move to extend a state of emergency over coronavirus for around two months in a set of measures to be proposed to Parliament on Tuesday . 
The Schengen area is a zone of 26 European countries that do not have internal borders and allow people to move between them freely , including countries such as Spain , France , Greece , Germany , Italy and Poland . 
The Elysée Palace would not comment on whether travelers from the US would be subject to quarantine measures if entering France .
