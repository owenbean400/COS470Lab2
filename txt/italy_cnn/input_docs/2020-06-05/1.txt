The number of coronavirus related cases and deaths in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo is likely to be under reported , a state health official said Thursday . 
Some of the cases have likely been registered as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) due to the state 's low Covid 19 testing capacity , said Paulo Menezes , coordinator of the state ’s health ministry . 
The state of Sao Paulo registered 5,717 new cases and 285 related deaths in the previous 24 hours – bringing the total in Brazil ’s most populous state to 129,200 cases and 5,717 deaths . 
But the actual death toll is likely higher , Menezes said . 
Menezes added that the state of Sao Paulo – which has a population of more than 45 million and is the epicenter of Brazil ’s outbreak – currently performs about 8,000 Covid 19 tests daily . 
In April , that average was about 1,000 tests per day . 
The state government forecasts that it will reach the daily testing capacity of European countries like Spain and Italy within three months .
