On the verge of 100,000 cases : With more than 97,000 cases of the virus , Italy is likely to soon become the second country in the world to break the 100,000 mark after the United States . 
Why has Italy become such a hot spot ? 
There is no clear answer yet as to why Italy has been so badly affected by the coronavirus . 
Some people have suggested it could be the climate or the high number of elderly citizens . 
Whatever the reason , Italy still has the highest death toll in the world at 10,779 fatalities , according to Johns Hopkins University .
