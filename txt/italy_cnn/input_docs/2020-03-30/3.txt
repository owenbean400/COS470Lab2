Germany has almost twice as many vacant intensive care ( ICU ) beds as Italy‘s entire number of ICU beds , the country 's health minister Jens Spahn said in an interview with Germany‘s public broadcaster ZDF . 
Germany has the highest number of ICU beds in Europe and is looking to double that number , Spahn said . 
Germany has among the highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide , but a fairly low death toll so far . 
German virologists believe that is the result of early and extensive testing as well as the widespread availability of intensive care capacities . 
Patients from hard hit European countries are being flown to Germany for treatment .
