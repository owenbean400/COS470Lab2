The coronavirus pandemic has been tied to an increased incidence of an inflammatory syndrome among children in Italy in a new study , and the researchers warn that similar outbreaks of this rare but serious illness can be expected in other nations . 
The study , published in the medical journal The Lancet on Wednesday , found cases of the syndrome appeared to increase 30 fold in the Bergamo province of Italy shortly after the coronavirus pandemic spread to the region . 
The syndrome , now frequently referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children , resembles another childhood condition known as Kawasaki disease . 
Dr . Lucio Verdoni of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo and colleagues studied the cases of children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease at the hospital between January 1 , 2015 and April 20 , 2020 . 
The patients were divided into two groups : one group represented those diagnosed in the five years preceding the coronavirus pandemic and the second group represented those diagnosed after Covid 19 hit the region . 
The data showed that the incidence rate of Kawasaki disease diagnoses was about 0.3 per month before the coronavirus pandemic , and then 10 per month afterwards between March and April of this year -- a very large increase . 
Kawasaki disease involves inflammation in the walls of medium sized arteries and can damage the heart . 
The new syndrome also involves inflammation , but infectious disease experts say it is different from Kawasaki disease . 
Symptoms include persistent fever , inflammation and poor function in one or more organs . 
Dr . Jeffrey Burns of Boston Children â€™s Hospital and other experts told CNN Wednesday that the condition appears to be a post viral syndrome that may develop several weeks after a Covid 19 infection .
