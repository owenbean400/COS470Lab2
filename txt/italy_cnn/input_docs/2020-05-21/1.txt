On May 16 Conte said that " if the data continue [ d ] to be encouraging " Italian borders would be open to those from within the EU â€™s Schengen Zone , but the country 's stance on a mandatory quarantine for travelers was unclear . 
Conte 's announcement on Thursday clarifies the matter , extending the open borders policy to the entire EU bloc . 
Britons , who are now outside the EU , will also be included .
