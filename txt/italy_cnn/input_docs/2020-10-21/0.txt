The national seven day case average has increased at least 18 % since the previous week and is now a staggering 61 % higher than what it was five weeks ago . 
And as multiple experts have warned , things will likely get worse before they get better . 
The difference is many European countries were able to suppress their numbers of new cases over the summer , but the US entered the fall season with a relatively high baseline average of new infections -- something experts warned would not help in containing another surge of cases . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci said earlier this week European Union countries were able to bring their baseline down because of strict and stringent lockdowns , adding the US did not " shut down nearly as much as our colleagues in Italy and Spain . "
