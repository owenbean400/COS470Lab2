European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to create a massive coronavirus recovery fund worth trillions rather than billions of euros . 
But they did not endorse " coronabonds , " the controversial debt pooling instrument that countries such as Italy and Spain hoped for . 
French President Emmanuel Macron said it was critical that the EU worked together in the face of the crisis , warning that " if we abandon part of Europe , all of Europe will fall . " 
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , a fierce critic of the Europe wide response to the pandemic that has hit his country so hard , expressed satisfaction with Thursday ’s virtual summit . 
He said the Council 's decision to launch the recovery fund was " important " to help some of the hardest hit countries . 
" It 's important because this is a necessary and urgent tool . 
It is absolutely necessary Italy is the first in line to ask for this , " he said in a short video statement . 
Coronabond controversy : The leaders agreed that the financing would be built into the EU ’s next seven year budget , rather than special instruments including the so called " coronabonds . "
