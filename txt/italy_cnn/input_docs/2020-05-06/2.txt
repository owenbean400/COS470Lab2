The 12th person infected by coronavirus in Vatican City works for Pope Francis , the Holy See Press Office said today . 
The person has been working remotely since early March and is now under observation at home , the Holy See Press Office Director Matteo Bruni said . 
Vatican City is the seat of the Catholic church and has been a sovereign state in the middle of Rome since 1929 . 
It has 605 residents , all with a Vatican City passport and who are out of Italy 's legal jurisdiction . 
The pandemic has radically changed the way the Vatican operates , with the Pope celebrating Palm Sunday mass in an empty church and the sites normally packed with tourists empty . 
The 83 year old Pope , who has a damaged lung from an infection in his 20s , has twice tested negative for coronavirus . 
He is being distanced from anyone who might be carrying the virus , takes his meals in his private quarters , and uses hand sanitizer before and after meeting any guests , the Vatican press office said last month .
