In Italy , 29,684 have died since the outbreak began . 
There was also a jump in new daily infections with an increase of 1,444 diagnoses , which is rise of 369 since yesterday . 
But the number of active cases in the country has dropped from 98,467 yesterday to 91,528 today . 
The decrease of 6,939 cases is the biggest ever . 
The sharp fall in active cases can be explained by a significant increase in recoveries of 8,014 , raising the total number of people recovered from the virus to 93,245 . 
However , the Italian Civil Protection Agency warns that the high number of recoveries is due to an adjustment on numbers and some of the cases pertain to the past couple of days .
