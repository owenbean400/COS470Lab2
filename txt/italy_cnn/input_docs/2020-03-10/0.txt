People infected by novel coronavirus tend to develop symptoms about five days after exposure — and almost always within two weeks , according to a study released Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . 
That incubation period is consistent with previous estimates from public health officials , and the findings suggest that 14 days of quarantine are appropriate for people potentially exposed to the coronavirus . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has used that standard during the current pandemic — recommending , for example , that people self quarantine for two weeks after traveling to countries with widespread coronavirus transmission , such as Italy or South Korea . 
To estimate the incubation period , researchers scoured more than 180 reports of coronavirus in places without widespread transmission — areas , in other words , where infection was likely due to outside travel . 
Because the study was conducted early in the coronavirus outbreak , community transmission at the time was limited to Wuhan , China . 
That allowed researchers to estimate the " time of exposure " to the coronavirus by determining when a person was in Wuhan — the only plausible source of infection . 
By comparing travel to Wuhan with the emergence of symptoms , researchers could then estimate an incubation period for the virus : usually about five days , and rarely more than 12 . 
It ’s possible , the researchers said , that their study may have focused on more severe cases of the virus – which are likelier to make the news and catch the attention of public health officials . 
The incubation for mild cases , then , might differ somewhat .
