The US coronavirus crisis has hit all 50 states but there is some good news , US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said on the " Today " show on Wednesday . 
" The good news is that states like Washington , like California , countries like Italy , when they leaned into aggressive mitigation , they ’re being able to flatten their curve and we know that if you do this that it usually takes about three to four weeks from the time you start to lean into it before you level it off , " Adams told NBC ’s Savannah Guthrie . 
Washington and California were home to some of the earliest Covid 19 cases in the United States . 
" We want nationally people to understand the importance of social distancing , " Adams said . 
Yet each state has its own curve and " the governors get to make the decisions , but we ’re going to give them the best possible guidance we can and that 's to stay at home and social distance , " Adams said .
