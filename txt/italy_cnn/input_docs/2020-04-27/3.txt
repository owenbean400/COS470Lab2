Prosecutors in the northern Italian city of Bergamo have opened an investigation into the handling of the coronavirus outbreak there , Prosecutor Maria Cristina Rottaâ€˜s office told CNN on Monday . 
Bergamo is in Lombardy , the Italian province worst hit by the coronavirus , and was among the first areas to be put under restrictions to try to curb the spread of Covid 19 . 
Bergamo citizen Luca Fusco , whose father died of coronavirus in March , started a Facebook group called " Noi Denunceremo " -- meaning " we will denounce you " -- to hold the authorities to account . 
The group , which has 48,000 members , wants to ' ' ensure that the truth of what really happened gets out , " Fusco said . 
Separately , ANAAO , a doctors ' union , has lodged formal complaints to prosecutors in 10 regions over what it described as a shortage of personal protective equipment for healthcare staff . 
" There 's a lack of adequate personal protective equipment for doctors exposed to Covid 19 . 
The high number of infections is linked to the failure to supply FFP2 and FFP3 filter masks , " Carlo Palermo , national secretary of the ANAAO , told CNN on Monday . 
So far , 150 doctors in Italy have died after contracting coronavirus , the Italian Association of Doctors said on Friday , adding that healthcare professionals constitute 10 % of all infections .
