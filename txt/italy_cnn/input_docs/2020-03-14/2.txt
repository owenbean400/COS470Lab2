New Zealand has canceled its National Remembrance Service for the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque attacks over coronavirus safety fears . 
The service , originally set for tomorrow , was " expected to attract a large crowd , with many travelling from around New Zealand and from overseas , " said a statement from the Christchurch City Council released today . 
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden was quoted in the statement saying that while there has been " no community transmission " of the coronavirus in the country , the government is " taking a cautious approach " as it would be difficult to trace who had come into contact with the participants . 
New Zealand has four cases so far , several of whom had traveled to the hard hit countries of Italy and Iran .
