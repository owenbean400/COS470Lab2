In northern Italy , life is difficult right now . 
In a country with more than 17,000 cases of the novel coronavirus , staying at home but for a solo trip to the store is the way of life . 
American Cristina Higgins lives with her family in Bergamo , near Milan . 
On Friday , she told CNN 's Erin Burnett that being in a country with a mandatory lockdown is like " living with dread . " 
Almost everything is closed and movement is restricted . 
Only supermarkets and pharmacies are open . 
Only one person from each household can go on a shopping run . 
Police write tickets for people who are out wandering . 
Lines sometimes form outside the stores because only a certain number of people are allowed inside at one time , and they must remain 3 feet apart . 
Yet Higgins said it was in everyone 's best interest to comply . 
Not everyone is adhering to the rules , she said . 
A woman in her community who has COVID 19 recently went out in public . 
" It 's very difficult . 
It 's very , very difficult , " she said . 
" It is , unfortunately despite all that Italy has done , they think that it may not be enough ( because not every person is complying ) . "
