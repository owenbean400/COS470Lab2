Travelers eager to fly again may want to consider Italy as their next destination . 
Rome 's Fiumicino Airport has become the first airport in the world to earn " the COVID 19 5 Star Airport Rating " from Skytrax , an international airport industry ratings body . 
Though Skytrax is best known for its annual rankings of the world 's best airports , the global Covid 19 crisis prompted the organization to come up with a designation for airport hygiene . 
According to a release from Skytrax , the organization based its rating on " a combination of procedural efficiency checks , visual observation analysis and ATP sampling tests . " 
Fiumicino Airport ( FCO ) , also known as Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport , is the busiest airport in Italy . 
Top marks : On September 1 , the airport opened a 7,000 square foot Covid testing center , which is co managed with the Italian Red Cross . 
But it 's not only organized , rapid testing that Skytrax noted in its review of FCO . 
The airport scored points for having easy to read signage in multiple languages , strict enforcement of mask wearing , visibly present cleaning staff and efficiency thanks to the consolidation of all incoming and outgoing flights to a single terminal for easier tracking .
