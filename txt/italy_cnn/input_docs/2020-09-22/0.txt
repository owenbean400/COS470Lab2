Most people with coronavirus develop symptoms at some point during infection , according to research published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine . 
The researchers found some evidence suggesting those who show no symptoms may be less likely to pass it on to their close contacts . 
Diana Buitrago Garcia , of the University of Bern in Switzerland , and colleagues reviewed 94 studies of people diagnosed with Covid 19 between March and June of this year . 
In 79 studies from a range of settings , they found 20 % of people did not show any symptoms during the course of Covid 19 infection . 
The researchers note that differences and potential biases among the studies limit the certainty of that estimate . 
In seven studies with defined populations of people who received coronavirus screening and follow up , 31 % showed no symptoms . 
These populations included health care workers , a village in Italy , blood donors and those evacuated from a setting where coronavirus transmission was confirmed . 
The researchers also found that those who had contact with asymptomatic people with Covid 19 were less likely to contract the virus than those who had contact with coronavirus positive people who did show symptoms . 
The researchers noteed that social distancing measures are important , since transmission can and does occur from people without symptoms and those who have yet to develop symptoms . 
They also emphasized the importance of testing and contact tracing .
