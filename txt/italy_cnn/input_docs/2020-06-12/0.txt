Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has been questioned by the prosecutor of Bergamo , Lombardy , on the outbreak of coronavirus in the region . 
The prosecutor arrived Friday morning at Palazzo Chigi , the seat of the Italian government , to question Conte as an " informed person on the facts . " 
The investigation was launched by the prosecutor after many complaints were filed with the prosecutor 's office by a group of people whose loved ones died of coronavirus . 
Lombardy , in Italy 's north , was the region worst affected by the virus . 
The government has been accused of being late in imposing a lockdown on two towns in the region -- Alzano and Nembro -- when outbreaks happened there in early March . 
This is the first legal action over coronavirus against the Italian government . 
Conte told reporters Wednesday that he was not worried about the questioning . 
The prosecutor has already questioned Silvio Brusaferro , head of the Italian Health Institute and president of the scientific and technical committee appointed by the government to advise on the fight against coronavirus when the epidemic started . 
The prosecutor will question Health Minister Roberto Speranza and Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese on Friday . 
The leader of the Lombardy regional government was questioned earlier this week . 
This post has been updated to correct when the Health Minister and Interior Minister are being questioned .
