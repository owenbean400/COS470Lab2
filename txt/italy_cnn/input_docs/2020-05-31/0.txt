In a small sign of life getting back to normal , crowds returned to St . Peter ’s Square in the Vatican City on Sunday as Pope Francis resumed his traditional greeting from his window , for the first time since lockdown began in Italy nearly three months ago . 
The Pope said he hoped people would " have the courage to change , to be better than before and to positively build the post pandemic world . " 
He appealed for everyone , including the world 's poorest people , to have access to health care and prayed particularly for those affected in the Amazon region of South America . 
" People are more important than the economy , " he said . 
Tourists were noticeably absent and only several hundred people , mainly Italians , wearing masks and social distancing , gathered to listen to the Pope and receive his blessing . 
" You know that from a crisis like this , you do not come out of it the same as before . 
You come out either better or worse , " he said . 
" The human family needs to come out of this crisis more united and not more divided . " 
Italian and Vatican Police were stationed at all entrances and people entering St . Peter ’s Basilica had their temperatures checked . 
The Vatican museums will open on Monday , by online reservation only . 
Museums and other cultural sites throughout Italy will also reopen this week .
