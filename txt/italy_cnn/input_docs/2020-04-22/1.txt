The last major cruise ship remaining at sea during the coronavirus pandemic docked in the port of Genoa , Italy today , regional council member Giacomo Giampedrone told CNN . 
The planned docking of the Costa Deliziosa was delayed Tuesday due to poor weather conditions . 
" The Costa Deliziosa has docked and health care personnel will go on board shortly , to transport the body of a woman who died on April 6 to the forensic office where a coronavirus test will be done , mainly as a precaution . 
Her death seems not be related to coronavirus , " Giampedrone told CNN . 
" We will carry out a protected disembarking , just like we did in other cases of cruise ships that had coronavirus cases on board . 
But this time we are protecting more the people on board , who have been sailing since mid March , than vice versa " Giampedrone said . 
Some context : The port of Genoa was chosen as the final destination of Costa Deliziosa by the Italian Transport Minister and the regional governor . 
The cruise line company will provide transportation to all passengers and the 900 crew members , according to Giampedrone .
