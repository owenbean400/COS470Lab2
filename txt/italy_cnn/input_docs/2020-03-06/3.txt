One audience member at CNN 's town hall asked : now that the virus has gone global , having reached every continent , except Antarctica , are travel restrictions still effective ? 
CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman weighed in from Milan , Italy , where towns and cities have been placed under lockdown in the country 's northern Lombardy region . 
Italy under lockdown : The police and army have set up roadblocks in " Red Zones , " and are checking everyone going in or out , Wedeman said . 
Most residents in the area are not allowed to leave at all . 
" Now , the Red Zones that were set up are due to , at least in theory , they should come to an end this coming Sunday . 
There 's a question of whether they will be extended . 
And therefore there 's a big debate here in Italy whether they have been effective at all because the numbers , frankly , continue to rise . " 
Numbers are spiking despite the lockdown : When Wedeman arrived in Italy 10 days ago , there were 322 infected cases nationwide . 
Now , the number has reached 3,858 .
