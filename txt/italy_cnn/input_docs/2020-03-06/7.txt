Since Italy suspended schools , many parents have had to rethink their routines . 
Some have been forced to work from home or turn to the help of grandparents , and women are taking on a lot of the child care burden . 
" It is hard for families to balance work and life . 
School is the backbone of the country , " says Gini Dupasquier , a consultant in Milan whose teenage daughters are now studying from home .
