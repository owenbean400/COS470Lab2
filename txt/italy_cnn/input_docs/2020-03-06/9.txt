The Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic has announced new measures for people returning from Italy , ordering every Czech resident who came back from the country starting tomorrow to contact their doctor and self quarantine for 14 days . 
The ministry said that the order has been issued due to the significant spread of the novel coronavirus in Italy and the fact that a majority of people who have tested positive for the virus in the Czech Republic have been infected during their stay in Italy . 
" According to our information , there are currently 16,500 Czech citizens in Italy , " the ministry said in a statement . 
The ministry has ordered family doctors to quarantine anyone coming back from Italy for 14 days . 
The statement added that anyone breaching a quarantine can be fined up to 3 million Czech crowns â€” about $ 130,000 . 
It said that people in quarantine are entitled to receive sick pay and urged employers to allow people who are quarantined but not sick to work remotely .
