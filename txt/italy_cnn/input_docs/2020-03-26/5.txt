While the world collectively shelters in place to protect against coronavirus , medical professionals flock to the front lines to work long hours tending to a burgeoning number of infected people . 
One of them is Dr . Nicola Sgarbi , 35 , who unknowingly became part of a growing photo trend of health workers coping with this exponential rise in sick patients . 
Sgarbi is a doctor in training who works in the ICU of the civil hospital of Baggiovara in Modena , Italy . 
Almost everything about Sgarbi 's shift on March 13 was part of his new normal since the outbreak : working 12 hours to treat Covid 19 patients while wearing protective equipment . 
But at about 8 p.m . that day , he stripped off his face mask and snapped a quick selfie , something he rarely does . 
Sgarbi 's photo was posted on Facebook and Reddit , where it was shared more than 75,000 times and voted on at least 119,000 times , respectively . 
The photo drew worldwide praise and comparisons to " Batman and Superman rolled into one , " among other things . 
Since then , numerous photos and stories of health workers in and out of protective gear have been posted around the internet . 
Each one captures the physical and emotional toll this pandemic is taking .
