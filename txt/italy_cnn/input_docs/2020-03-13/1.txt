CNN has kicked off its two hour coronavirus town hall with a look toward Europe , where every member country of the European Union has reported infections . 
" It 's fairly eerie here , where we arrived just a few days ago and the streets were full of people , full of traffic , " said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman from Bologna , Italy , where he has been reporting on the nationwide lockdown . 
People can still go outside for a walk , jog , or run errands , said Wedeman — but people have to keep a certain distance from each other , and all public events or gatherings are canceled . 
That means even things like a children 's soccer game are now prohibited under the emergency restrictions . 
Churches are closed , even for people going in for private prayer — something that has never happened , even during wartime , Wedeman said . 
Some context : Italy has been under total lockdown since Monday . 
The nationwide lockdown extended measures already in place in the northern Lombardy region to the rest of the country , affecting about 60 million residents . 
This means restricted movement , schools closed , public services suspended , events canceled , and more .
