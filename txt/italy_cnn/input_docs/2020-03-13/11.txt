The UK government 's chief scientific adviser has explained the country 's plan to " delay the peak " until summertime and attempt to create " herd immunity " to the novel coronavirus . 
Patrick Vallance , Britain 's chief scientific adviser , told Reuters that the UK 's strategy -- which has not yet included closing schools , banning events or advising people to work from home -- was aimed at preventing the National Health Service from being overwhelmed . 
He said the goal was to " protect people in the most infectious period " and " delay the peak and to push the peak down " until the summer months , when the NHS is less overburdened , according to Reuters . 
The UK is thought to be about four weeks behind Italy and other European countries , with between 5,000 and 10,000 people believed to be infected . 
As of Thursday morning , the UK had tested 29,764 people . 
There have been almost 600 confirmed cases and eight people have died .
