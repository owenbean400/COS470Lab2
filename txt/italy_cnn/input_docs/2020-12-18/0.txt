Italy will enforce its strictest level of Covid 19 measures nationwide over the Christmas and New Year 's Day period to avert the risk of a third wave of coronavirus infections . 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Friday that the entire country will be declared a virus " red zone " between Dec . 24 and Dec . 27 , and on Dec . 31 and Jan . 1-6 . 
The restrictions mean residents can only leave their houses for health or work reasons or to cover essential needs , such as exercise or grocery shopping . 
Residents can also go out to visit a maximum of two non household family members between the hours of 5 a.m . and 10 p.m . Meaning households can host two extra family members on Christmas Eve . 
Churches must close by 10 p.m . , which rules out the traditional midnight mass for millions of Catholics in Italy . 
Health Minister Sandra Zampa had said the Christmas Eve mass must end by around 8:30 p.m . , " so that worshippers can return home before the 10 p.m . curfew . " 
During these days , all shops , bars and restaurants will be closed except for delivery and take out . 
The country 's risk level will be lowered to an " orange zone " on Dec . 28 , 29 , 30 and Jan . 4 . 
That means residents will be allowed to travel only within their towns . 
A curfew will still be in place between 10 p.m . and 5 a.m . 
In this period , shops may open until 9 p.m . but bars and restaurants must remain closed . 
Approximately 645 million euros ( about $ 790 million ) will be set aside to support the catering industry , the prime minister said , adding that other activities hit by the strict measures will be eligible to access government funds .
