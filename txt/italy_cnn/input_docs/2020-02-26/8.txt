While the Pope 's Ash Wednesday mass at the church of Santa Sabina in Rome is going on as planned , other Catholic churches across Italy are modifying their services because of coronavirus . 
Catholic churches in many cities in the north of Italy — such as in Bologna , Turin , and Venice — have suspended their Ash Wednesday services . 
Some of them are offering masses online or through local television . 
Ash Wednesday is one of the most important religious days for Catholics after Christmas and Easter . 
It signifies the beginning of Lent , a period of six weeks before Easter when many Christians fast , abstain from meat and make a personal Lenten sacrifice to prepare themselves for Easter .
