Guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace on the Spanish resort island of Tenerife are confused over the situation at the hotel , which was partially put on lockdown yesterday as an Italian man at the hotel tested positive for the coronavirus overnight . 
Spain 's Health Ministry emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said that four people in Tenerife — an Italian couple and two others traveling with them — have now tested positive for the virus , and another four in other parts of the country had been infected . 
Simon said Spain was changing the contagion risk from low to moderate . 
The change in risk comes as a cluster of cases in northern Italy spreads to several European nations . 
Guest Silke Bal said that people in the hotel were calm but confused about where in the hotel they were allowed to go . 
She said she saw towel collection services re open by the swimming pool . 
Some guests had breakfast delivered to their rooms by staff wearing masks and gloves , Bal said . 
" We could get coffee at the restaurant , but we had to put our mouth masks on , " she told CNN . 
Bal said she expected to go home on Saturday but that she could not get a clear answer from the hotel . 
Staff appear to know as little as the guests , she said .
