President Trump said he " has a very good relationship " with Dr . Anthony Fauci even as the White House sent out talking points from an unnamed official to discredit the nation ’s top infectious disease expert . 
Asked if he still appreciates the advice Dr . Fauci provides , Trump said , " I have a very good relationship with Dr . Fauci . 
I ’ve had for a long time , right from the beginning . 
I find him to be a very nice person . " 
Trump said that he " does not always agree " with Fauci , citing his decision to cut off travel for those coming in from China , a decision he claimed Fauci disagreed with at the time . 
However , Fauci told ABC in March that " the President 's decision to essentially have a major blocking of travel from China , that already had an effect of not seeding the way , in Europe — Italy did not do that . " 
Fauci also supported temporary travel closures from other places , saying at the time " what we 're doing now with the other travel restrictions — so you block infections from coming in and then within is when you have containment and mitigation . 
And that 's the reason why the kinds of things we 're doing that may seem like an overreaction will keep us away from that worst case scenario . " 
Trump added that he personally likes Fauci . 
Fauci has become increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country amid a surge in coronavirus cases , and said last week , that he had not briefed Trump in two months .
