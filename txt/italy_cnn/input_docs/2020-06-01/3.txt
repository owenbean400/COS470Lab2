The world famous Uffizi gallery in Florence will reopen on Wednesday , according to an announcement on its website . 
It 's the latest in the list of Italian monuments and museums to reopen as the country gradually lifts coronavirus restrictions . 
Vatican Museums , which host the Sistine Chapel , have welcomed the public again starting Monday , as has the Coliseum , but under strict rules such as temperature checks for visitors , compulsory face coverings and maintaining distance during the visit . 
Travelers from the European Union and the UK will be allowed to enter Italy without having to go into quarantine starting Wednesday , in a move the government has described as a " calculated risk . " 
Visitors were previously required to undergo a two week quarantine before being allowed entry .
