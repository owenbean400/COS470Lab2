The number of coronavirus cases in Italy has reached 86,498 , according to a tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University . 
That puts the European country ahead of China , where 81,946 infections have been confirmed . 
Both are short of the over 104,000 cases reported in the United States . 
However not all countries report or measure cases in the same manner , so the true figures could be higher in Italy and China . 
More than 9,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Italy , more than anywhere else in the world , followed by Spain at 5,138 deaths , and China at 3,295 . 
In the US , there have been about 1,700 deaths so far , according to the Johns Hopkins tally . 
Italy had 969 deaths on Friday -- the biggest single day jump since the crisis began . 
The country 's health system has been pushed to the brink by the outbreak , especially in the north , which has seen the highest concentration of cases .
