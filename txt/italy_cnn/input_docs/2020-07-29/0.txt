The earliest global spread of the novel coronavirus came from travel involving mostly three countries : China , Italy and Iran , researchers reported Wednesday . 
Three quarters of cases reported outside of China in January and February were linked to travelers from an affected country , mostly those three , a team at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found . 
" Cases with travel links to China , Italy , or Iran accounted for almost two thirds of the first reported Covid 19 cases from affected countries , " the CDC â€™s Dr . Fatimah Dawood and colleagues wrote in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases . 
The team went through online reports from national ministries of health and other government agency websites , social media feeds , and news releases to tally up all coronavirus cases reported between December 31 and March 10 . 
Half of the early cases in Africa were linked to travel from Italy , they found . 
Travelers from Italy also carried the virus in a third of the earliest cases elsewhere in Europe and the Americas . 
The analysis also showed that large gatherings were a source of spread . 
While many studies have confirmed that the virus originated in China , genetic analysis shows that a new strain arose in Europe , likely Italy , early in the pandemic and that strain predominated in the US .
