Millions of people are under lockdown in northern Italy -- but core sectors of the economy and the public administration will remain open for business , according to a statement from the Finance and Economy ministry Monday . 
The sweeping lockdown went into effect yesterday , placing the entire Lombardy region and 14 other provinces under strict measures , including cancelations of events and school closures . 
These measures would impact sectors tied to transportation , lodging , food , drink and entertainment , said the ministry 's statement . 
The Italian government is preparing measures to support workers and firms across the country , particularly in sectors and areas most affected by the outbreak , the ministry statement added . 
These measures will aim to prevent " lasting damage to the supply side of the Italian economy and permanent employment losses . "
