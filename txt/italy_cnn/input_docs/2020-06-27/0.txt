Schools in Italy will reopen on September 14 with social distancing measures in place , Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Education Minister Lucia Azzolina announced Friday . 
According to the government ’s announcement , schools will be required to stagger morning arrivals and seat students one meter apart from each other . 
Meals must also be eaten in classrooms , rather than in school cafeterias . 
" These guidelines will allow us to send back to school our daughters and sons in maximum safety , " Conte said during a press conference . 
While home schooling will only be permissible for older students , the government says it will make use of decommissioned schools and encourage more outdoor activities , including field trips , to tackle the lack of available space for other grades . 
" Let the students breathe culture…why not ? 
Take the smaller children to parks when the weather allows it and let them be close to nature , " Azzolina said . 
In order to prepare for the safe resumption of classes in September , Prime Minister Conte said the government would invest an extra 1 billion euros ( $ 1.12 billion ) to renovate schools , procure protective sanitation products and provide training to educators . 
" This money is not aimed only to face the coronavirus . 
We dream of a different school , a school where finally money is invested to improve it , " Italy ’s Education Minister said . 
" Kindergarten and primary school children have suffered the most during the lockdown…and also the disabled . 
They are the ones who have suffered most , and they are the ones to whom schools will need to give a stronger answer in September , " she added .
