Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force coordinator , said Monday that she wished the United States had adopted a total lockdown similar to the one enforced in Italy . 
In a roundtable discussion hosted by Arkansas Gov . 
Asa Hutchinson , Birx said she has learned what Americans are willing to do to combat the virus , and that we must meet people where they are . 
She explained how the strategy worked for Arizona , where people were still able to go to malls and restaurants at reduced capacity , but gyms and bars were closed , mask mandates were implemented and gatherings of more than 10 people were prohibited . 
" People were interacting , people were out , but people , by just not doing those careful things , were able to drop the cases significantly , probably by more than 80 % , " said Birx . 
She said that kind of behavioral change is something every American can do . 
" Tens of thousands of lives can be saved if we wear masks , and we do not have parties in our backyards … taking those masks off . " 
" Somehow we always believe our family ’s safe and our friends are safe . 
You cannot tell who 's infected with the virus , " Birx added . 
" You need to keep your mask on . "
