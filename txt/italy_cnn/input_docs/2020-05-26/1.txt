Italian singer Andrea Bocelli said Tuesday he had Covid 19 but has now fully recovered . 
The classical singer said he did not reveal he was sick sooner " not to unnecessarily alarm " his fans and protect his family 's privacy . 
Bocelli said he decided to reveal this now because he is donating blood to participate in a clinical study to find a cure for Covid 19 . 
In April , as the historic Duomo Cathedral in Milan , Italy , sat closed closed to the public on Easter because of the pandemic , Bocelli gave a special audience free concert .
