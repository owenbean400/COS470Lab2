Up to 420,000 jobs in trade and tourism could be lost in Italy due to the coronavirus emergency , Enrico Postacchini of the Italian Confederation of Enterprises — called Confcommercio — said Wednesday during a senate hearing in Rome . 
Confcommercio estimates that 270,000 businesses in the trade and tourism sector — 10 % of the total number — are in danger of closing down . 
Postacchini appealed to the government to act immediately to help businesses . 
" Business operators have lost patience , they have not seen anything apart from the 600 euros , " he said referring to the emergency bonus for workers introduced by the government in March . 
Huge losses will be registered during the tourist season and once the health emergency is over , " there will be the problem of filling hotel rooms , " Confcommercio ’s representative for tourism Alberto Corti said in the same hearing . 
Only 20 % of Italians will be able to go on vacation , with the exception of those who have second homes , he said . 
In the tourism sector the losses could be around 120 billion euros ( about $ 130 billion USD ) between now and the end of 2020 , Corti said .
