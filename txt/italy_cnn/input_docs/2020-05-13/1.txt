The number of calls to a government run anti violence helpline in Italy increased by 73 % during the coronavirus lockdown , the Italian National Institute of Statistics ( Istat ) said Wednesday . 
Between March 1 and April 16 , at least 5,031 calls were registered , an increase of 73 % compared to the same period of 2019 . 
Just under half of those who called the hotline asked for help , an increase of 59 % , Istat said in a statement . 
Remember : According to the statistical agency , the increase is not necessarily attributable to greater violence but could be due to more awareness . 
Meanwhile , the worst hit Italian region of Lombardy on Tuesday registered a small increase in the number of Covid 19 cases for the second day in a row , after a few days in which active case numbers were going down , according to the Italian Civil Protection Agency . 
Lombardy officials said the increase in cases could be explained by the addition of data that was collected from the past few day . 
The total number of cases in Italy , including deaths and recoveries , stands at 221,216 .
