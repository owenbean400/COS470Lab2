Monica Moretti , 46 , lives in Casalpusterlengo , a Northern Italian town in the so called " red zone , " where tens of thousands of residents have effectively been cut off from the rest of the country as it works to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
It ’s the seventh day that she and her 15 year old daughter have lived under lockdown . 
Most things are closed , she said , including shops , restaurants , movie theaters , banks and post offices . 
Only grocery stores and pharmacies remain open . 
" I ca not move , I ca not go to work . 
It is also just the mental constriction . 
It is like being imprisoned at home . 
We can only go out with masks , " she told CNN . 
She said she feels like she 's " in a movie . " 
" One of those catastrophe ‪ , contagion ‬ movies , where you see the epidemiologists using biohazard weapons and everyone dies . 
In 24 hours , we were the focus of the news , closed at home wearing masks and the panic set in amongst everyone , " she said . 
However , Moretti said the situation is not as severe as what has been seen in the news . 
" The way it was presented on the media , especially Italian media , is exaggerated . 
They make it sound like everyone inside the red zone is sick and 99 % of us are OK , " she said . 
Despite the lockdown , life as usual is going on in the red zone . 
She takes afternoon walks and her family has been cooking and eating together . 
" When we do not have nothing to do , I think it ’s a survival mechanism telling us : if you are in danger , eat more . 
So we have been cooking a lot of food , " she said .
