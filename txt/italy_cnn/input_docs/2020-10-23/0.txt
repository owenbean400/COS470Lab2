The coronavirus pandemic is causing " unacceptable " shortages of US drug supplies in the United States , according to a report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy ( CIDRAP ) at the University of Minnesota . 
The report says shortages have limited 29 of 40 drugs critical for treating Covid 19 patients , including propofol , albuterol , midazolam , hydroxychloroquine , fentanyl , azithromycin and morphine , according to the American Society of Health System Pharmacists . 
The FDA , which has more stringent criteria for shortages , show 18 of 40 are on the Drug Shortage list .

" The urgency with the drug shortage supply issue is related directly to the major increase in COVID 19 cases that we will experience in the coming months , " Michael Osterholm , the director of CIDRAP , said in a news release .
