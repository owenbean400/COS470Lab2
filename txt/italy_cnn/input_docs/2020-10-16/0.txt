Travelers entering the United Kingdom from Italy will have to self isolate starting on Sunday , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced Thursday . 
In a tweet , he said both the Vatican and San Marino will also drop off the UK â€™s " Travel Corridor , " a list of countries considered safe enough for travelers to visit without self isolating on entry to the UK . 
He also announced the UK would add the Greek island of Crete to the Travel Corridor , meaning people entering the UK from anywhere in Greece will not have to self isolate .
