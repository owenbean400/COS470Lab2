A new study from Italy suggests that coronavirus can cross the placenta from a pregnant woman to her fetus . 
Two babies born to women infected with Covid 19 were born infected themselves , Claudio Fenizia of the University of Milan and colleagues reported at a conference organized by the International AIDS Society . 
They studied 31 women infected with coronavirus who were in late pregnancy during the height of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy . 
They thoroughly tested the women , their babies once they were born , the placenta , the umbilical cord , the mother ’s vaginal fluids and breast milk . 
Two of the newborns had positive tests at birth , they reported . 
The placentas were inflamed , as well — a sign of infection . 
The umbilical cord blood of one of the newborns had antibodies indicating a recent infection . 
These antibody types are not usually transmitted from mother to baby , so they indicate the fetus was directly infected , Fenizia said . 
Luckily , the women were infected late in pregnancy so it is unlikely the virus would have affected the babies ’ development , he said . 
The Zika virus can pass from a pregnant woman to her unborn child , sometimes causing severe brain damage and a condition called microcephaly . 
HIV — the virus that causes AIDS — can also be transmitted at birth .
