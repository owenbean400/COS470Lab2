Italy still has not identified " patient zero , " the source of the coronavirus outbreak in the country , two officials said Monday . 
" The important thing is to identify ‘ patient zero , ’ where he/she is from , and to stop this chain of infection , " Angelo Borrelli , the head of Italy ’s civil protection agency , said . 
Luca Zaia , the governor of the Veneto region , said " no news " when asked Monday by CNN affiliate Sky 24 about the hunt for the carrier . 
Borrelli suggested an explanation for the sudden spike in cases over the weekend : " I believe that the incubation period meant that the infections all exploded at a certain moment . "
