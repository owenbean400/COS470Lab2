A fourth person has died in Italy after catching the virus , a hospital in the north of the country said Monday . 
The man had been transferred Sunday from the village of Val Alzano Lombardo to the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo , near Milan . 
The hospital told CNN the man was 83 and had underlying serious health problems , but did not say what they were . 
Italian media have variously reported his age as 84 or 85 . 
He did not know how he became infected , the hospital told CNN . 
Why this matters : More than 150 cases have been confirmed in Italy , renewing fears that the virus is spreading globally despite numerous travel restrictions placed on China . 
Italian authorities have announced sweeping closures across the country 's north and emergency measures Sunday as they scramble to contain Europe 's largest outbreak .
