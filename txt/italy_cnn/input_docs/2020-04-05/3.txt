A priest in the Lombardy region of Italy has been celebrating mass in an empty church , except for photographs of parishioners he has taped to the pews . 
Don Giuseppe Corbari told CNN that the idea of having pictures of his faithful came to him because " we 've started holding masses without the faithful since February 24 . " 
He said he found delivering mass to empty pews was difficult at the beginning . 
Corbari said when he thought to ask parish members to send him their pictures , he did not expect the response he got . 
" I did not expect such a collaborative reaction . 
I was inundated by pictures , and I printed them . . . . now I see that other parishes , even around the world , are doing similar things , " he said . 
So far , the church , Santi Quirico e Giulitta a Robbiano di Giussano , has been broadcasting mass over the radio but it plans to start live streaming soon .
