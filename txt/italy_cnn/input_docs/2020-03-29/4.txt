The " credibility and usefulness " of the European Union is " at stake " with the coronavirus crisis , French Minister of State for European Affairs Am√©lie De Montchalin said on Sunday . 
Speaking to RTL Radio , De Montchalin said : " If some do not want [ solidarity ] , we 'll have to question their place [ in the EU ] , and to question what we are still doing with 27 member states . 
It 's a fundamental , existential question . " 
De Montchalin was speaking following disagreements among EU member states over the best way to tackle the impact of the coronavirus on the EU economy . 
A European diplomat with knowledge of a lengthy EU meeting that took place on Thursday told CNN Italy and Spain had blocked a final EU wide statement , saying it was vague and lacked concrete measures . 
" If Europe is just an internal market when everything is well , then it has no sense to it , " De Montchalin added .
