President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that he knows " for a fact " that the United States does not actually have the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world , saying it 's simply testing more than any other country -- a comment the coordinator of his White House coronavirus task force later clarified . 
" I think the reporting here has been pretty straight forward for the past five – six weeks , " Dr . Deborah Birx told reporters . 
" Prior to that , when there was not testing in January and February , that ’s a very different situation and unknown . " 
Earlier in the press conference , Trump said that " America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world , and I think that ’s probably why we have more cases . " 
" Because you look at some these very large countries , " he continued , " I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do , but they do not report them . " 
Per capita , countries like Italy and South Korea have done more testing than the United States by far . 
Many experts believe that the number of coronavirus cases in the US is likely higher than reported due to problems with testing availability . 
Birx elaborated there may have been early deaths in the US that were not counted as coronavirus related , but perhaps should have been . 
Birx said some countries do not consider coronavirus to be the cause of death in some individuals with pre existing conditions . 
" There are other countries that if you had a pre existing condition , and let ’s say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem , some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a Covid 19 death . " 
" The intent is right now , " she said , " if someone dies with Covid 19 , we are counting that as a Covid 19 death . " 
She later conceded that some rural areas might not " have the same level of testing . "
