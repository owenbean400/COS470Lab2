France officially entered lockdown at midday Tuesday local time ( 7 a.m . ET ) as part of a number of measures announced by President Emmanuel Macron . 
All non essential outings are outlawed and can draw a fine of up to € 135 ( $ 148 ) . 
In a televised speech Monday , Macron also promised to support French businesses by guaranteeing € 300 billion worth of loans , as well as suspending rent and utility bills owed by small companies . 
" No French company , whatever its size , will be exposed to the risk of collapse , " he said . 
The French government will also support healthcare staff by paying for hotels , taxis and childcare during the coronavirus crisis , Macron said in a series of tweets following his speech . 
" We owe the care of their children to our healthcare teams : a minimum service has been put in place , from today , in kindergartens and schools , " Macron said . 
" We also owe them peace in their travel and rest : this is why , from tomorrow onwards , taxis and hotels can be mobilized for their benefit . 
The state will pay . " 
Macron also said hospital masks will be rationed for healthcare workers . 
" We have decided to reserve the masks as a priority for hospitals and for medical personnel in cities and in the countryside , especially for general practitioners and nurses , who are now at the front line of dealing with the crisis , " he said in a tweet . 
France joins Italy , which has been under total lockdown since Friday , and Spain , whose 47 million people have been under partial lockdown since Saturday , allowed to leave their homes only to go to work , buy food , or visit a pharmacy or hospital . 
Switzerland has also banned all events and closed shops and restaurants from midnight Monday .
