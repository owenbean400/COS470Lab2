Italian Sport Minister Vincenzo Spadafora said Wednesday that if people will not stay at home , in compliance with the coronavirus emergency measures , the government will be forced to " ban outdoor sports activities . " 
He added that the general consensus was to stay at home but " if people will not follow it , we will be forced to place an absolute ban , " Spadafora said . 
Spadafora made the announcement on Italian State television RAI 1 . 
The " Cure Italy " ( Cura Italia ) decree passed this week by the government and " suspended all tax obligations until 30 May for all sports federations and sports activities " and " suspended the rents of all those structures owned by the State and municipalities where sports activities are held , " according to the decree . 
Spadafora also indicated that Seria A soccer league will possibly resume on May 3 . 
" This is what we hope for . 
We will evaluate whether with open or closed doors , this will depend on the situation , " Spadafora said .
