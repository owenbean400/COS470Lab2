While Italy imposes a nationwide lockdown , and Ireland announces school suspensions , blanket bans are not quite so simple in fellow European country Germany . 
Essentially , German chancellor Angela Merkel does not have the sweeping power to close down large parts of public life across the entire country . 
Germany is a federal state . 
So when it comes to political decisions like canceling public events , closing down schools or implement new health regulations , those are taken at state level . 
Merkel and her national ministers can only make recommendations . 
Over the last few days , Germany ’s Health Minister , Jens Spahn , has repeatedly recommended canceling mass public gatherings with over 1,000 people . 
Some of Germany ’s hardest hit regions have implemented this ban already — but not all of them have . 
The same goes for the closure of schools and universities . 
Some have been shut , while others continue to operate .
