For Lorenzo Vanni , Thursday was truly historic — it was the first day in 53 years his bar restaurant in Rome , called Vanni , did not serve a single drink or meal . 
In the district of Prati , just next to Vatican City , Vanni has every year stayed open on Christmas Day , January 1 and even Ferragosto , a day when just about everyone leaves the city to celebrate the Feast of Assumption . 
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday night expanded already heavy restrictions to include bars , restaurants and shops , now forced to close their doors as the country tries to slow its coronavirus infection rate . 
" Today in Rome the atmosphere is surreal . 
It 's strange , like in a movie . 
I am stunned , incredulous . 
It has never happened before , " Vanni said . 
He says he 's very worried about its employees . 
" It 's a total disaster for workers . " 
Vanni was founded by Lorenzo grandfather in 1929 and has moved locations several times , finding its current spot in 1967 . 
With pride , he described Vanni is a Roman landmark " where people meet and chat , socialize — it ’s a point of reference in the neighborhood . " 
" People called me this morning asking me where they will eat from now on , " he said . 
" My main concern are the employees , their families and mine of course . 
Now we have to think about how to buy supplies and the state must put everyone in a position to do so . " 
He is asking the government to offer businesses like his tax relief . 
" Otherwise it will condemn companies to certain closure . "
