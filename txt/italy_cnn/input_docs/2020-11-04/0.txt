Italy will impose new restrictions on residents from November 5 , requiring them to stay home from 10 p.m . to 5 a.m . 
The country 's new package of pandemic measures encompasses three different levels of risk , based on the virus transmission rate , the number of available intensive care unit beds and testing capacity . 
Under national restrictions , public transport will be capped to 50 % of capacity , museums and exhibition centres will be closed , and cruise ships suspended . 
In addition , masks at school will be compulsory for all students above six years old . 
Restaurants and bars can remain open for regular clients until 6 p.m . , after which they can only provide take away or delivery services . 
As well as the national level , regional restrictions will also come into place in some areas . 
These will be designated " orange zones " and " red zones " depending on the severity of the pandemic . 
Deputy health minister Sandra Zampa said in a radio interview that the new rules are " tailored " to deal with differing situations by region . 
In " orange zones " people will be banned from leaving the area -- except for work or health reasons -- and bars and restaurants will only be able to do delivery and take away service . 
In " red zones " people will not be allowed to move away from their town of residence and all non essential shops will be closed . 
The new rules are set to last until December 3 . 
Italy has reported more than 750,000 cases of Covid 19 and 39,000 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University data .
