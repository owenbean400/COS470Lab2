US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said the US is looking into why young people in the country are being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus . 
" So far the demography definitely seems to be very different in the United States versus in other countries that saw this hit earlier , " US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said on the " Today " show on Monday morning . 
" And we 're looking into that , " Adams told NBC 's Savannah Guthrie . 
" There are theories that it could be because we know we have a higher proportion of people in the United States and also in Italy who vape , " Adams said . 
" We do not know if that 's the only cause . " 
In New York state so far , more than half of coronavirus cases — 53 % — have been among young people between the ages of 18 and 49 , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo noted on Sunday .
