Italy ’s health minister commended the country for its work to overcome the coronavirus pandemic , saying that while Italy still has some way to go in eliminating the virus , it is " out of the storm " of the crisis . 
" I think Italy did it . 
I am not thinking of the government , but of the country as a whole , " Health Minister Roberto Speranza said . 
The numbers in Italy : According to the latest data from Italy ’s Civil Protection Agency , another 15 coronavirus related deaths have been recorded over the last 24 hours , while 128 new cases have been confirmed . 
" We were the first to be hit in the world after China . 
We did not have an instruction manual , we had to learn about the virus , " Speranza said . 
" The international situation is worrying , we are in the worst moment of the epidemic in the world , " he added , cautioning that the crisis will only " be a thing of the past " when a successful vaccine is developed .
