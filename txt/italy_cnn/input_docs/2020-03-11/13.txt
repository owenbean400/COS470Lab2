Italians are taking the quarantine measures increasingly seriously on day two of the nationwide restrictions , with most people wearing masks at the Testaccio market in Rome . 
There were a few arguments as people " got too close " to each other , while others had mastered the skill of lifting their masks to smoke . 
The ground was covered in tape marking the required meter ( three feet ) to be maintained between people , along with signs giving instructions on expected behavior after the country recorded more than 10,000 reported cases . 
According to government guidelines , hairdressers and beauty salons should only fulfil existing bookings and must avoid close contact between customers and staff , who are expected to wear masks and gloves . 
But barbers were seen cutting hair on the sidewalk this morning . 
While defiant attitudes had lessened , there was talk of " clandestine dinner parties " and secret socialization going on in certain buildings . 
The Italian finance minister Roberto Gualtieri said Italy has allocated 25 billion euros -- $ 28 billion -- to fight the coronavirus crisis .
