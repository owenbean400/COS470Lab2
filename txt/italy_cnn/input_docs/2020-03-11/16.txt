As part of nationwide quarantine measures , Italy has issued a ban on all public gatherings â€” including weddings and funerals . 
But at least one group of mourners in Rome got around the restrictions by parking a hearse outside a church and having a priest come outside to give a blessing over the coffin as it sat inside . 
Italians are finding ways of living under the national lockdown : Some people seen having their hair cut on the streets to circumvent the rule against booking new appointments to avoid packing people too close together . 
Stores have been limiting the number of people allowed to enter , while bars and restaurants have been keeping tables apart and using tape to mark one meter ( three foot ) gaps between people .
