The mayor of the city of Austin in the US state of Texas , Steve Adler , tweeted Monday that he is extending stay at home orders to 15 August , as the number of Covid 19 hospitalisations increase statewide . 
The order " strongly encourages " reopened businesses to operate at an indoor capacity of 25 per cent or below , but is not mandatory , Adler said , since the state ’s governor , Greg Abbott , has allowed restaurants in Texas to operate at 75 per cent capacity and other businesses , like barbershops and gyms , to be open at 50 per cent capacity . 
Abbott has also said people cannot face legal ramifications for not wearing masks , but strongly advised people to wear them . 
" It ’s pretty simple , " Adler said . 
" Wear a mask when you go outside , and do not go places where people are not wearing masks . 
" The community gets to make this choice . 
We get to decide how important it is that we try to protect those around us . " 
Texas reported a record high number of Covid 19 hospitalisations on Monday of at least 2,326 people . 
There have been at least 89,108 cases of Covid 19 , and at least 1,983 deaths in the state , according to CNN .
