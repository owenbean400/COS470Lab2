A group of British travellers quarantined on the Grand Princess cruise ship said they have no idea when they will be able to return to the UK . 
Although the ship is due to dock in Oakland , California , on Monday , only passengers requiring treatment and state residents will be allowed to disembark . 
It is not known what will happen to passengers from other countries . 
Justine Griffin , of Leicestershire , was on board with her husband Dave and friends Jan and Allen Duffin , and Sharon and Steve Lane , when it was placed into quarantine . 
She told PA news agency : " We wo not be getting off tomorrow as we are at the bottom of the list . 
First the sick , then Californians , then any other Americans . 
" They have no plans for international passengers yet - rumours going round about Texas but nothing concrete yet . " 
The couple , who renewed their vows on board for their 25th wedding anniversary , have not been tested for coronavirus but believe they will have to enter quarantine in the UK for two weeks when they return home .
