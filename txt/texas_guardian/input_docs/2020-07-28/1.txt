US president Donald Trump abruptly ended a press conference on Tuesday after a sustained question from CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins over a video he had shared by a doctor who said masks do not work and that there is a cure for Covid 19 . 
In past videos , said Collins , the doctor has claimed that medicines are made from " alien DNA " . 
" I thought she was very impressive , " Trump said of the woman in the disinformation video he promoted . 
Here ’s more background from colleagues Joan E Greve and Martin Pengelly : The video in question featured Dr Stella Immanuel , a physician from Houston , Texas , speaking on the steps of the US Capitol in Washington , surrounded by members of a rightwing doctors ’ group . 
Immanuel made baseless claims about coronavirus , including hailing hydroxychloroquine as a " cure " , even though the drug , which has been repeatedly touted by the president , has not been found to be an effective treatment . 
The Houston doctor has also dismissed mounting evidence that face masks substantially help limit the spread of coronavirus . 
Before Trump walked off , he said he did not know why Twitter and Facebook removed the hydroxychloroquine video he promoted : . @ kaitlancollins : The woman you say is a ' great doctor ' said masks do not work & amp ; doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens TRUMP : " I can tell you this : She was on air , along with many other doctors , & amp ; they were big fans of hydroxychloroquine . 
I thought she was very impressive "
