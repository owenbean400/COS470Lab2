Texas is already one of the hardest places in America to vote , and Greg Abbott , the Texas governor , on Thursday made it even harder . 
The announcement from Abbott , a Republican , limits an executive order from July that made it modestly easier for voters to return their ballots during the pandemic . 
Texas usually only lets voters return their mail in ballots in person on election day , but Abbott ’s July order said voters could return their ballots in person to the election clerk ’s office earlier . 
He also extended early voting by six days . 
As a result , some of the biggest counties in the state had planned to offer voters multiple places to could drop off their ballots . 
Harris county , the most populous in the state , planned to let voters return their ballots at 11 of the clerk ’s annex offices around the county . 
Travis county , home of Austin , planned to offer four places to return their ballots . 
But the move drew backlash within his own party ; 
Republicans sued the governor over the changes . 
On Thursday , Abbott backtracked on his earlier order and issued a new executive order only allowing counties to offer voters a single place to return their ballots . 
Abbott ’s order also said officials had to let official poll watchers inspect the process . 
Abbott ’s order quickly drew outcry and accusations of voter suppression . 
Texas already severely limits mail in voting to those who are 65 and older , or who meet a select few other requirements . 
The state has aggressively opposed a slew of lawsuits seeking to ease those restrictions amid the pandemic . 
Texas has seen massive growth among Hispanic and other minority voters in recent years , and many of the restrictions in place are seen as a blatant effort to preserve white political power . 
Harris county clerk Chris Hollins said the new proclamation issued by Abbott " will result in widespread confusion and voter suppression " .
