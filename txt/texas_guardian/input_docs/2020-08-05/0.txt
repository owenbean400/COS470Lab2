Florida has surpassed 500,000 coronavirus cases as testing ramps up following a temporary shutdown of some sites because of Tropical Storm Isaias . 
A long line of cars waited outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm . 
Florida reported 225 new deaths on Wednesday , bringing its seven day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185 , behind Texas with 197 . 
Florida ’s rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid April . 
The number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two week decline , with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning , a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago . 
The Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday . 
Overall , Florida ’s reported 502,739 cases ranks second to California , with more than 527,000 cases , and above Texas with more than 466,000 , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The Hard Rock site briefly shut down on Wednesday because of lightning in the area . 
Testing resumed once the weather cleared . 
Florida governor Ron De Santis this week announced that quicker testing , with results in about 15 minutes , would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park . 
" Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you do not get your result back for seven days that is not helpful . 
For asymptomatic test takers , if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time , " De Santis said .
