In the US , the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has accused the incumbent Donald Trump of " surrendering " to the pandemic and failing to stay prepared for a resurgence that could put a US economic recovery at risk . 
American people sacrificed so much to fight this virus ... we may lose some the progress we ’ve begun to make . 
All because he ’s lost interest . 
Now he ’s just flat surrendering the fight . 
Trump is eager to reopen the economy and resume political campaigning even as the number of cases has started to rise again , with record increases reported this week in the states of Oklahoma , Texas and Oregon . 
The president is planning his first rally since people were forced to stay at home three months ago in heavily Republican Oklahoma , over the objections of public health officials . 
Biden said : He ’s so eager to get back to campaign rallies that he*s putting people at risk .
