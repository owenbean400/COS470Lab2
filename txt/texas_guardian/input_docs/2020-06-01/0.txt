Here are those comments in more detail . 
Trump mentioned the virus once , saying the protests mean , " Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes . " 
My fellow Americans , my first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the American people . 
I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what I will do . 
All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd . 
My administration is fully committed that for George and his family , justice will be served . 
He will not have died in vain . 
But we cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob , the biggest victims of the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities and as their president I will fight to keep them safe . 
I will fight to protect you . ... 
Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas , Texas , who was left dying on the street or the woman in Upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs . 
Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed . 
New York ’s finest have been hit in the face with bricks . 
Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes . 
A police precinct has been overrun here in the nation ’s capital , the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial have been vandalised . 
One of our most historic churches was set ablaze . 
A federal officer in California , an African American enforcement hero , was shot and killed . 
These are not acts of peaceful protests . 
These are acts of domestic terror , the destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offence to humanity and a crime against God .
