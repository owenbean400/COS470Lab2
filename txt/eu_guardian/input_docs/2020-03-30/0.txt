British officials took part in four meetings where EU projects to bulk buy medical kit were discussed – the earliest in January , according to official minutes that heap doubt on government claims of missing an email . 
Last week Downing Street claimed that it failed to take part in an EU scheme to source life saving ventilators and other kit to treat coronavirus because it accidentally missed the deadline . 
No 10 initially said it did not take part because the UK was no longer a member of the EU and was " making our own efforts " . 
After critics accused Boris Johnson of putting " Brexit over breathing " , Downing Street clarified that missing out was an error and it would consider participating in future . 
It is understood the UK claimed not to have received an email from the EU asking it to participate . 
EU minutes seen by the Guardian show that a British official joined eight out of 12 EU health security committee meetings dedicated to the Covid 19 outbreak since the group was set up earlier this year , shortly before China ’s Hubei province was put into lockdown .
