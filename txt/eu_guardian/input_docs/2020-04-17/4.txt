Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe , the British Iranian mother temporarily released from prison in Iran due to the outbreak , does not yet know when she will have to return to complete her sentence . 
She was originally released for two weeks with an ankle tag but Iran remains in the grip of the pandemic on the eve of her scheduled return . 
The Iranian government claims there have been fewer than 5,000 deaths in total but pandemic modellers based in the US estimate that , as of 20 March , more than 15,000 have lost their lives . 
Zaghari Ratcliffe ’s husband , Richard Ratcliffe , has said : We are waiting on news tomorrow . 
Her lawyer will go to the prosecutor ’s office to check whether she needs to return to prison or it has been extended .
