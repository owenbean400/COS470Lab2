So far at the White House ’s daily briefing : Trump has said he will be sending out $ 19bn in relief to farmers , in addition to $ 28bn in bailout money sent to farmers to offset the impacts of his administration ’s tariffs on imports . 
Trump added that : " Following the announcement of our reopening guidelines , there have been some very partisan voices in the media and politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacities . " 
State and local leaders have complained that they are having trouble getting equipment , including swabs , needed to ramp up testing . 
Yesterday , to speed up testing and address supply shortages , the FDA announced that it would allow a broader range of swabs to be used for tests , including some that would be easier to manufacture . 
But the messaging from Dr Deborah Birx , the White House ’s coronavirus task force response coordinator , Dr Anthony Fauci , the US ’ top infectious disease expert , and Dr Brett Giroir , the assistant secretary for health , is that there will be enough testing , soon . 
Trump , meanwhile , has been insisting that the testing capacity is already where it needs to be . 
" If about 1 out of 10 people are positive , " Giroir said , then health officials know that they are testing enough people .
