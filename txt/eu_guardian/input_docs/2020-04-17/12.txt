Here are a few more updates from the White House daily briefing , which is ongoing . 
Trump has been asked to address a series of incendiary tweets which appeared to stoke protests against physical distancing and other stay at home measures in three states led by Democratic governors . 
Trump told reporters he is " very comfortable " with what he posted . 
He said that some states are going too far with social distancing measures . 
But states are currently following federal guidelines encouraging Americans to stay home . 
Earlier on Friday , Trump had tweeted : " LIBERATE MINNESOTA ! " , " LIBERATE MICHIGAN ! " and : " LIBERATE VIRGINIA , and save your great 2nd Amendment . 
It is under siege ! " 
– a reference to Virginia ’s governor , Ralph Northam , last week signing into law new measures on gun control .
