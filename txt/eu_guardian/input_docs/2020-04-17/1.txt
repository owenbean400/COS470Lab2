The US navy will carry out antibody testing of sailors aboard the virus hit aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to determine whether they were exposed to the virus as it spread through the ship . 
The navy surgeon general , Rear Admiral Bruce Gillingham , has said : We have scheduled the outbreak investigation to begin Monday and we are seeking crew member volunteers to provide an additional swab sample and a routine blood draw for laboratory testing . 
In addition , they will answer a short survey . 
The blood sample will undergo a new test that identifies Covid 19 antibodies in the blood . 
This type of testing is called a serology test . 
The results tell us if people have been exposed to the coronavirus and subsequently developed antibodies .
