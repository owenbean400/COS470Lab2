Spain ’s government has warned the Madrid authorities of drastic measures if the region fails to move decisively to slow the spread of coronavirus infections . 
The city and surrounding region is at the centre of a second wave of coronavirus that is sweeping Spain , having claimed more than 31,000 lives and infected over 700,000 in the country . 
Over the past week , the Madrid authorities have placed about a million people under partial lockdown , but the measures have fallen well short of the central government ’s demands , triggering a warning from justice minister Juan Carlos Campo . 
If Madrid ’s conservative led regional government did not toughen its strategy , " there is no doubt that [ the central government ] is prepared to do whatever is necessary " to rein in the virus , he told Spain ’s RNE public radio . 
Spain is struggling with the highest number of new cases in the EU with a rate of nearly 300 per 100,000 inhabitants – and in the Madrid region , the figure currently stands at more than 775 per 100,000 . 
Campo ’s remarks came as the leftwing administration of prime minister Pedro Sánchez ramped up a campaign to pressure Madrid ’s regional government . 
Since the national state of emergency ended on 21 June , responsibility for public healthcare and managing the pandemic has been in the hands of Spain ’s 17 autonomous regions . 
Over the past week , Madrid has imposed partial lockdowns on areas in and around the city , where residents cannot leave their neighbourhoods unless for work , school or medical reasons , although they are not confined at home and can move freely within their district . 
An initial confinement order affecting 850,000 people was rolled out a week ago , with another 167,000 people added on Monday . 
Police are conducting random checks to ensure compliance with the new rules , which now apply to nearly one in six of the region ’s 6.6 million residents .
