The lengthy coronavirus shutdown of pubs in Ireland has hit the 3,000 or so people in the village of Dunmore and surrounding area particularly hard . 
Five out of its six village pubs have been shut since March , depriving the community of institutions that act as pillars of rural life . 
Publican Joe Sheridan unbolts the door of Walsh ’s Bar in the County Galway village . 
With bars shut , " you can see the people carrying the woes of life on their faces " , he said . 
The walls of his pub are jammed with group photos , sports memorabilia and dusty bottles . 
It is testament to the pub ’s fluid role as community hall , museum and an understated sort of group catharsis in the village . 
" The lights are going out in rural Ireland , " he said . 
Irish pubs shut on 16 March , as the nation braced for the coronavirus , which has so far claimed 1,777 lives . 
After a 15 week hibernation , those serving food were permitted to reopen . 
But so called " wet pubs " serving drink only remained shut , with the government repeatedly pushing back reopening . 
Restrictions are due to expire on 13 September in what the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland has called the " longest lockdown in the EU " . 
Industry bodies estimated that around half of the Republic ’s 7,000 pubs are still shuttered . 
With population flight , a declining agriculture industry and scant alternative social outlets , pubs in rural Ireland play a role that is hard to overstate . 
Many people in the countryside still eat their main daily meal at lunchtime , reserving a stretch of uninterrupted evening for the pub . 
Historically , pubs have acted as hardware stores , grocery shops and drapers , filling the void of state infrastructure with small business and mutual aid . 
" It ’s the thing of a ‘ meitheal ’ , " explained Sheridan . 
" It ’s an Irish word for a group coming together to work voluntarily . " 
But the lockdown is " messing with traditions that have been built up over generations " , he said .
