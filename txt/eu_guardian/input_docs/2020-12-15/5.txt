Greek lawmakers have approved a 2021 budget built around weaker forecasts for a rebound from the coronavirus pandemic . 
Latest projections see the Greek economy slumping 10.5 % this year , worse than the 8.2 % predicted in October . 
Meanwhile the 2021 rebound should see 4.8 % expansion , down from a previous forecast of 7.5 % . 
After weathering the first wave of the pandemic better than most European countries , Greece in early November resorted to a nationwide lockdown that has weighed on activity and is now expected to last until 7 January . 
The economy had returned to growth in the third quarter , following a 14 % quarter on quarter slump in April June that was the worst in at least 25 years . 
Greece faces " unprecedented circumstances , with uncertain facts and the end of the crisis unknown , " prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told lawmakers before the vote . 
But as inoculations get under way around the world , and with the EU expected to soon follow suit , he added " the vaccine is the boundary between the end of the pandemic and the preface of the post covid era , and the budget is adapted to these conditions " . 
Planning to spend € 24bn in 2020 and € 7.5bn next year to cushion the economy from the impact of the virus , Greece ’s debt to GDP ratio should climb to around 209 % before falling back below 200 % .
