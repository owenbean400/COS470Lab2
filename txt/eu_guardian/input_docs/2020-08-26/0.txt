Phil Hogan has quit as the EU ’s trade commissioner after days of pressure over allegations he breached Covid 19 guidelines during a trip to his native Ireland , saying it had become clear the controversy was a distraction from his work . 
The forced exit of a heavyweight from the bloc ’s executive will be a credibility blow for the team led by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for less than a year . 
The Commission will play a key role in pushing across the line a € 750bn recovery fund for EU economies hammered by the coronavirus crisis , and Hogan himself had been making headway in fraught trade talks with the United States . 
Hogan said in a statement : It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead . 
I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland - the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life - caused such concern , unease and upset . 
Hogan attended a golf dinner last week that outraged the Irish public and led to the resignation of an Irish minister and the disciplining of several lawmakers . 
He had insisted on Tuesday that he adhered to all rules during the trip .
