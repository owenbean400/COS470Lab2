The EU ’s healthcare systems are at risk of being overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus cases unless authorities act quickly , the head of the European Commission , Ursula von der Leyen , said . 
" The spread of the virus will overwhelm our healthcare systems if we do not act urgently , " she said after a video conference of EU leaders to coordinate the EU ’s response to the Covid 19 pandemic . 
She said the Commission made available € 220m to finance the transfer of Covid 19 patients across EU countries to avoid healthcare systems in the most affected countries not being able to cope . 
At the meeting leaders agreed to better coordinate efforts to battle the virus as infections in Europe exceeded 10 million , making the continent again the centre of the pandemic . 
EU countries want to avoid divisions which dogged the 27 nation bloc at the beginning of the pandemic , when nations vied with each other to buy scarce medical equipment . 
To better trace infections , von der Leyen said the EU would work for the quick validation at EU level of rapid antigen tests , which allow quicker results than the standard PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) molecular kits .
