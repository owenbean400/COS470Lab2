Lithuanians will be encouraged to bring their own pens to minimise infection risk at Sunday ’s parliamentary election seen as a vote of confidence on prime minister Saulius Skvernelis ’ handling of the coronavirus crisis . 
Lithuania has reported 8,714 infections - including a record 205 new cases on Saturday - and 103 deaths . 
Mindful of contagion , election officials have asked voters to mark ballots with their own pens . 
For early voting this week , they also set up a drive through centre and booths in public squares . 
Teams in protective costumes have been visiting the 32,000 voters self isolating at home to collect their ballot . 
The centrist Farmers and Greens party , an agrarian grouping that leads Skvernelis ’ ruling coalition , is neck and neck in opinion polls with the centre right Homeland Union , which has roots in the 1980s anti Soviet independence movement , Reuters reports . 
With support roughly 15 % for both , and 15 other parties on the ballot , another coalition is inevitable but its makeup uncertain . 
Many in the Baltic Sea state of less than 3 million are aggrieved at income inequality despite brisk economic growth since Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004 . 
A fifth of people were at risk of poverty in 2019 , mostly the elderly , which was the same figure as a decade ago , according to the state statistics authority . 
However , Lithuania ’s relative resistance to the economic impact of coronavirus curbs has helped compensate a previous slump in support for the government over corruption allegations . 
The economy decreased 4 % year on year in the second quarter of 2020 , the second best result in the EU . 
The central bank attributed that to a prompt and short lockdown , generous state support and relatively unaffected trading partners .
