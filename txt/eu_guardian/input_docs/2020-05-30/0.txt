Key English election battlegrounds in the north west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year , new analysis has warned . 
Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain ’s EU transition deal , which expires from January . 
It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal , before the final round of talks this week . 
However , an impact assessment of ending the transition period found that manufacturing , banking , finance and insurance sectors would be " severely exposed " to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus . 
The Social Market Foundation analysis divided the country into areas and then placed each in a category between 1 and 5 , with 5 representing those most exposed to a double hit . 
Half of those in the north west are in category 5 and a further 40 % in category 4 . 
It said that the West Midlands , where the Tories made major gains in last year ’s election , was also exposed .
