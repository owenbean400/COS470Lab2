European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid 19 as part of an " international alliance " fighting the disease . 
An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in £ 6.6bn in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The leaders of France , Germany , Italy and Norway and senior EU officials told of how the outbreak had " caused devastation and pain in all corners of the world " . 
They wrote in the Independent : This poses a unique and truly global challenge . 
And it makes it imperative that we give ourselves the best chance to defeat it . 
This means bringing together the world ’s best – and most prepared – minds to find the vaccines , treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again , while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all , with a particular attention to Africa . 
The politicians declared their support for the World Health Organisation and backed the recent launch of the " Access to Covid 19 Tools Accelerator " . 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust were also said to be joining forces with the leaders . 
Funding will be directed to health organisations such as CEPI , Gavi , the Vaccines Alliance , the Global Fund and Unitaid .
