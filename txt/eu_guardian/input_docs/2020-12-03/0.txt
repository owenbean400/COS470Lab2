The EU says hope is in sight for refugees who have borne the brunt of strict lockdown restrictions in camps in Greece , our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens . 
Following on extraordinarily difficult year for asylum seekers in holding facilities on frontline Aegean islands , the European Commission announced it is working with Greek authorities to overhaul reception centres . 
A new reception centre , to be built on Lesbos , is expected to be ready by September . 
The facility will replace a temporary tent camp created as part of an emergency operation after the island ’s notoriously overcrowded installation in Moria was destroyed by fires almost three months ago . " The memorandum signed today sets out the respective responsibilities and areas of cooperation between the Commission , the Greek authorities and EU agencies , " the bloc ’s executive branch said in a statement . 
The agreement comes on the back of a € 12m accord that Athens has also signed with the EU to establish new reception and identification centres on Samos , Kos and Lesbos . 
" We will bring decent conditions to migrants and refugees who arrive as well as supporting the communities on the Greek islands , " said European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen . 
" It is also about fast and fair procedures , so the centres are what they should be – only a temporary stop before either return or integration . " 
Some 19,000 asylum seekers are currently living in 32 facilities across Greece . 
Following the outbreak of the pandemic camps like Moria have been subject to increased lockdown measures in contrast to restrictions being eased elsewhere in Greece as authorities have sought to contain the spread of coronavirus infections among the refugee population .
