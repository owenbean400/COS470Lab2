Ireland ’s prime minister Micheal Martin asked EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan to " consider his position " on Saturday , after revelations he attended a parliamentary golfing event in breach of coronavirus guidelines . 
Martin and deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar - the head of Fine Gael , the party for which Hogan previously served as a lawmaker - " did speak with Commissioner Hogan today and asked him to consider his position " , a government spokesman said , according to AFP . 
Hogan was named by newspaper the Irish Examiner as one of the 82 attendants of an Oireachtas ( parliament ) Golf Society dinner on Wednesday night . 
The event was held 24 hours after the government announced fresh Covid 19 restrictions to curb a new surge in cases , including no " formal or informal events or parties " to be held at hotel restaurants . 
It was reported attendees sat at tables of ten in breach of coronavirus guidelines , and that organisers erected a room divider in a bid to skirt legislation banning gatherings of more than 50 . 
But police on Friday said they had opened an investigation into the event for alleged breaches of that same legislation . 
Irish agriculture minister Dara Calleary and deputy chair of parliament ’s upper chamber Jerry Buttimer both resigned their roles on Friday after their attendance at the event . 
Hogan initially said he had been assured the dinner - attended by swathes of lawmakers , a supreme court judge and the Moroccan ambassador - would comply with government guidelines . 
He later issued a statement apologising for " the distress caused by his participation " , according to state broadcaster RTE . 
A spokesman for Martin said : " The commissioner ’s apology came late and ... he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his actions . " 
Martin and Varadkar " both believe that the event should never have been held , " he added .
