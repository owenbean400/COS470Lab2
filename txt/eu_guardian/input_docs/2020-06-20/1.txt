Portuguese prosecutors said on Saturday they had launched an investigation into a birthday party attended by scores of people which could have led to many new coronavirus infections . 
Prosecutors in the southern Faro region said they were probing a late night party on 7 June " gathering scores of people " in the beach town of Lagos , which took place despite a ban on gatherings of more than 20 , Agence France Presse reports . 
There have been a little over 1,500 Covid 19 deaths in Portugal and 38,841 cases out of a population of some 10 million . 
The party " could be the origin of an outbreak of Covid 19 infections " , they said . 
Local media cited health officials as saying that the party could have caused about 100 new coronavirus cases . 
" Those who think they can resume a normal life are gravely mistaken , " health minister Marta Temido said on Friday . 
Most of the cases have surfaced in the capital Lisbon and surrounding areas . 
On Thursday , Portugal had the highest daily rate of infections in the European Union after Sweden by population size . 
" We are finding it hard to break the transmission chains , " Temido said . 
There has been an outcry in Portugal over quarantine measures or coronavirus tests imposed on nationals travelling to other countries in the EU â€™s visa free Schengen zone .
