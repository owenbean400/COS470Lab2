Spain â€™s foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez has said that British tourists can visit the country from Sunday without facing quarantine . 
Spain will reopen its borders to visitors from other EU countries and the Schengen area on Sunday , with the exception of Portugal , which has asked Madrid to delay the opening of the land border until 1 July , when Spain will begin welcoming travellers from the rest of the world .

But Gonzalez said that she expected Britain would lift its restrictions , making it unnecessary for the Spanish side to apply reciprocity . 
About 12 per cent of Spain â€™s economy is based on the tourism sector . 
According to the report of National Institute of Statistics , nearly 18 million British tourists visited Spain in 2019 , more than a fifth of the overall total of nearly 84 million visitors .
