The European Union â€™s transport commissioner , Adina Valean has said that she is pleased stranded trucks are now moving " slowly across the Channel " , as restrictions between France and the UK were lifted . 
The initial restrictions were imposed after the UK discovered a new variant of the Covid 19 virus , which , reportedly has a faster transmission rate . 
Around 10.000 truck drivers are seeking to get back in the EU . 
Other thousands are already in the Dover area in their vehicles . 
We worked hard these days to unblock a crisis between two European countries , France and the UK . 
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ We issued a communication appealing for proportional , non discriminatory measures and the lift of any restrictions for transport workers . 
I am pleased that at this moment , we have trucks slowly crossing the channel , and I want to thank UK authorities that they started testing the drivers at a capacity of 300 tests per hour .
