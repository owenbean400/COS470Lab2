North Macedonian political parties on Monday agreed to have parliamentary elections on 15 July despite a persistent level of new coronavirus infections , a move seen as a crucial step for the country ’s EU membership bid , Reuters reports . 
The elections in the landlocked Balkan country and newest NATO member will also be a test of support for the pro EU policies of the Social Democrats of former prime minister Zoran Zaev . 
After talks with Hristijan Mickoski , the head of the main opposition and nationalist VMRO DPMNE party , Zaev said the country needed a functional government to deal with the pandemic and before the autumn because of the possibility of another surge in coronavirus infections . 
North Macedonia ’s economy is forecast to contract 3.5 per cent this year and is expected to return to growth in 2021 . 
" We cannot bear a bigger crisis than this with a technical government and without a parliament , " Zaev told reporters . 
A transitional government had initially scheduled a snap parliamentary election for 12 April but postponed it . 
Coronavirus has so far infected 4,157 people in North Macedonia and killed 193 . 
Last week , the republic lifted a state of emergency introduced in March to contain the outbreak .
