Time has never moved as slowly as it did in that last week . 
But eventually , the day arrived . 
In the five months since we had last seen each other , the world had changed completely . 
Had we ? 
At the hotel , a woman took down my details and asked who I was there to pick up . 
My voice cracked as I explained , and she warned me not to cry , " because I wo not be able to hug you " . 
As I left the lobby to head to the street where Felix would emerge , I heard her cooing to a colleague : clearly I was one of many pining spouses , and she was a romantic . 
As I waited on the street in the middle of the city , I attempted to lean coolly against the blue Toyota Corolla borrowed from my in laws . 
To my left , guests emerged , embraced their parents , friends and partners . 
To my right , every now and then , was someone craning their neck up , smiling as they spoke into earphones . 
Then Felix called to say he would be emerging from the lobby side after all . 
I jumped into the car and turned the key in the ignition . 
The engine spluttered . 
The battery had died .
