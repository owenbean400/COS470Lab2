Austria is considering reintroducing border controls with Italy , in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has led to a dozen northern Italian towns being put into lockdown . 
Italian authorities have said they will impose fines on anyone entering or leaving restricted areas . 
More than 200 people have contracted the virus and six people have died . 
The European commission announced on Monday that it would send experts to Italy from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , in a joint mission with the World Health Organization . 
The EU executive also announced a € 232m ( £ 195m ) package to deal with the virus , although some of the funds have yet to be signed off .
