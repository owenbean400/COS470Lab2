The British government has decided not to join a European Union coronavirus vaccine scheme because of concerns there could be costly delays in securing the vaccines , according to a report in The Daily Telegraph . 
The European Commission is expected to be notified on Friday , the newspaper said . 
UK business minister Alok Sharma is believed to have withdrawn from the plan after failing to get " sufficient assurance " that it would receive the number of vaccines it needs on time . 
The officials believed that signing up to the scheme could delay the rollout of a successful vaccine in the UK by up to six months as talks on distribution took place , according to government sources . 
The decision comes a week after officials in London and Brussels said Britain was in discussions with the EU about whether it would join a plan by the bloc to secure supplies of potential vaccines against Covid 19 .
