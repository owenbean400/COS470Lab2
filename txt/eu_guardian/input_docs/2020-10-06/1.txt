Belgium will tighten coronavirus restrictions at the end of the week , limiting groups to a maximum of four people in a bid to stem a sharp rise of Covid 19 infections . 
New prime minister Alexander De Croo , who took office five days ago , told a news conference he was aware Belgians were tired of restrictions , but they had to stick to the rules to avoid a fresh lockdown . 
Health minister Frank Vandenbroucke said that from Friday Belgians should limit to three the number of people outside their homes for whom they did not observe social distancing . 
No more than four people should be invited inside a home , be seated at a single bar table or gather outside . 
Bars will all have to close at 11pm . 
Belgians have been able to see up to five people without social distancing and be in groups of up to 10 people at a table in a bar or restaurant . 
" People are tired , we know , but we are going to again ask for an effort for our children , so they can keep going to school , for our businesses , so they can keep functioning and so that people do not lose their jobs , " Vandenbroucke said . 
Covid 19 has claimed 10,078 lives in the country of 11 million people , producing one of the highest per capita fatality rates in the world . 
The average daily number of new infections over a week passed 2,300 on Tuesday .
