Dr Anthony Fauci , the head of the US coronavirus taskforce said that he believes the Covid 19 variant detected in the UK must be taken " very seriously " but is not likely to cause more serious illness or be resistant to vaccines . 
He said : " Does it make someone more ill ? 
Is it [ a ] more serious virus in the sense of virulence ? 
And the answer is , it does not appear to be that way . " 
Fauci backed the decision by US officials for people entering the US to require negative Covid tests . 
He told CNN â€™s State of the Union that the worst for the US was still yet to come in the pandemic .
