Hundreds of British tourists quarantining in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier fled in the night , rather than finishing their period of self isolation . 
About 200 of the 420 tourists in the luxury Alpine resort left under the cover of darkness , according to the country â€™s Sonntags Zeitung newspaper . 
The Swiss government introduced a 10 day retrospective quarantine for anyone who arrived from Britain since 14 December , after the detection of a new potentially more contagious Covid 19 variant . 
Two cases have been detected in the country , and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein . 
" Many of them stayed in quarantine for a day before they set off unnoticed under the cover of darkness , " Jean Marc Sandoz , spokesman for the Bagnes municipality , told SZ . 
He called the whole situation " the worst week our community has ever experienced " . 
The situation was given away by untouched breakfasts , left by visitors who had escaped , he said . 
The new quarantine rules also applied to hundreds of British tourists who had planned to spend the Christmas break in Verbier , an alpine village located in the municipality of Bagnes in Canton du Valais , nicknamed " Little London " by locals for the British visitors who make up 20 % of tourists during a typical winter season .
