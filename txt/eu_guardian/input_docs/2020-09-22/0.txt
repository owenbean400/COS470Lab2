Wisconsin governor Tony Evers declared a new public health emergency and extended a face coverings mandate into November to fight a flare up of coronavirus cases , as the United States surpassed the grim milestone of 200,000 Covid 19 deaths . 
In person social gatherings led to cases skyrocketing among people aged 18 to 24 , Evers said , as he pleaded with students who returned to colleges for the fall semester to stay out of bars and wear masks . 
" We are seeing an alarming increase in cases across our state , especially on campus , " the governor said in a statement . 
Evers ’ previous mask mandate , part of a second public health emergency he issued in late July , was due to expire on Monday and has been challenged in court by a conservative group arguing the governor , a Democrat , violated state law in using emergency powers more than once . 
Wisconsin has experienced one of the highest percentage increases of coronavirus cases nationwide over the past two weeks , and has the second highest rate of positive coronavirus tests in the nation at 17 % , according to a Reuters tally . 
The US continues to have world ’s highest number of Covid 19 deaths . 
On a weekly average , it is losing about 800 lives each day to the virus , according to a Reuters tally . 
That is down from a peak of 2,806 daily deaths recorded on 15 April .
