Saudi Arabia will gradually resume the year round umrah pilgrimage from 4 October , the interior ministry said on Tuesday , seven months after it was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic . 
In the first stage , " 6,000 citizens and residents within the kingdom will be allowed to perform the umrah per day from October 4 , " the ministry said in a statement published by the official Saudi press agency . 
Visitors from outside the kingdom will be permitted from 1 November , when the capacity will be raised to 20,000 pilgrims per day , the ministry said . 
Umrah , the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undertaken at any time of the year , attracts millions of Muslims from across the globe each year . 
The ministry said umrah would be allowed to resume at full capacity once the threat of the pandemic is eliminated . 
Saudi Arabia suspended umrah in March and scaled back the annual hajj over fears that the coronavirus could spread to Islam ’s holiest cities . 
The pilgrimages are a massive logistical challenge , with colossal crowds cramming into relatively small holy sites , making them vulnerable to contagion . 
The decision to resume umrah was in response to the " aspirations of Muslims home and abroad " to perform the ritual and visit the holy sites , the interior ministry said . 
Saudi Arabia ’s custodianship of Mecca and Medina - Islam ’s two holiest sites - is seen as the kingdom ’s most powerful source of political legitimacy . 
The sites draw millions of pilgrims every year and are a key revenue earner for Saudi Arabia . 
The government hopes to welcome 30 million pilgrims to the kingdom annually by 2030 .
