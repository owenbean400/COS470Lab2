A Hungarian MEP in Viktor Orbán ’s rightwing party , spotted fleeing along a gutter to escape police raiding a " sex party " above a Brussels bar , has apologised for breaching Belgium ’s lockdown rules . 
József Szájer , a senior member of the Fidesz party who helped write Hungary ’s constitution in 2011 , was one of about 20 people , mainly men and including at least two EU diplomats , who attended a party held near the Grand Place in the Belgian capital ’s historical centre on Friday evening . 
The MEP had attempted to escape the scene by climbing out of a window from the first floor apartment before being spotted by a passerby " fleeing along the gutter " , according to Sarah Durant , a spokeswoman for the Brussels region ’s deputy public prosecutor . 
" The man ’s hands were bloody , " Durant said . 
" It is possible that he may have been injured while fleeing . 
Narcotics were found in his backpack . 
The man was unable to produce any identity documents . 
He was escorted to his place of residence , where he identified himself as SJ ( 1961 ) by means of a diplomatic passport . " 
It was reported he tried to claim diplomatic immunity . 
In a statement , Szájer , 59 , who resigned on Sunday without mentioning his brush with the law , apologised for his " irresponsible " behaviour but denied carrying drugs .
