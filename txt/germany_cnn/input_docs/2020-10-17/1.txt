German Chancellor Angela Merkel has appealed to citizens to do more to fight rising numbers of coronavirus infections across the country , urging Germans in a video message to abide by the regulations set out by the government . 
" We must do everything to ensure that the virus does not spread in an uncontrolled way . 
Every day now counts , " Merkel said as daily infections have hit record highs this past week . 
" How the winter will be , how our Christmas will be , that will be decided in the coming days and weeks , " Merkel added . 
Germany ’s strategy against the pandemic has so far centered around effective contact tracing of infected individuals in order to isolate them before they can infect others . 
" Health authorities are doing amazing work in this regard … but where the number of infections become too high , they simply cannot keep up , " the German Chancellor said . 
In an effort to stem the continued spread of the virus , Merkel also urged citizens to " meet with a lot fewer people " both outside and inside their homes , adding that people should try to avoid traveling or attending large gatherings unless absolutely necessary . 
" If each us drastically reduces the amount of contacts outside if their own family , then it is possible to stop and even reverse this trend , " she added .
