Coronavirus is resurgent across Europe after restrictions were eased in many countries , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said . 
There was an increase in weekly cases , last week for the " first time in months , " WHO Europe chief Henri Kluge said at a press conference in Copenhagen . 
Kluge said he had warned of the " risk of resurgence " as countries eased lockdown measures . 
Thirty countries in Europe have recorded increases in cumulative cases in the past fortnight , he said . 
Kluge added that accelerated transmission in 11 countries " has led to very significant resurgence that if left unchecked will push health systems to the brink once again in Europe . " 
Kluge cited Poland , Germany and Spain as examples of countries which responded quickly to new outbreaks of Covid 19 in schools , coal mines and food production facilities . 
" Rapid and targeted interventions , " by those countries helped to control the transmission , the WHO official said . 
Kluge also emphasised the role that digital technology can play in the suppression of outbreaks . 
" We need to get smarter in using the evidence and information we have from our Covid 19 surveillance systems , " he said . 
Twenty seven countries have released national solutions for digital contact tracing with solutions underway in places such as Portugal and Ireland . 
Kluge also spoke of artificial intelligence projects being piloted including an Italian smartphone app which measures a person 's heart rate , oxygen saturation rate and respiration rate in real time . 
According to Kluge these digital technologies help health systems to " cope with the delivery of essential health care , " but cautioned that " integrating digital health must be done carefully and wisely in partnership with the public and patients . "
