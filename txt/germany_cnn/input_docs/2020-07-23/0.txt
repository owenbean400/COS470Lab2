Countries coming out of lockdowns and countries with low levels of Covid 19 will still experience potential clusters and outbreaks of the disease , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization â€™s Health Emergencies Programme , said on Thursday . 
Ryan explained during a news conference that even in countries that have brought down the virus " under extreme control , " such as Germany and Spain , " there 's always a chance that the disease can be imported or the disease can spread from unseen clusters . " 
Ryan said that rather than implementing widespread lockdowns , governments should be " more precise " in how they contain an outbreak . 
Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO 's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit , said that if outbreaks " are dealt with swiftly " through testing and contact tracing , " you have an opportunity to really put that fire out quickly . "
