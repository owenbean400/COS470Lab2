Germany recorded 410 deaths related to coronavirus in the past 24 hours -- the highest one day jump in fatalities since the outbreak began , the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , the country 's disease and control agency , said on Wednesday . 
It was the first time more than 400 Covid 19 deaths were recorded in Germany in a single day , as the country grapples with a recent surge in new coronavirus cases .
