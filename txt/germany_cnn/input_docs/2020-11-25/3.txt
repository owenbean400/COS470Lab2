Germany will extend its partial nationwide lockdown until at least Dec . 20 or potentially stretch it until January , keeping existing curbs in place as a way to slow the spread of coronavirus , German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced at a news conference on Wednesday . 
" Infection numbers remain at a level that is far too high , " Merkel said . 
The partial nationwide lockdown means the German government requires restaurants and bars to remain closed , people to avoid travel , to keep their contacts to an absolute minimum and to limit public meetings to members of only two households . 
Schools and shops have remained open . 
Despite the extension , restrictions are expected to ease from Dec . 23 until Jan . 1 , with " closest family or friendship circle " allowed to meet in groups of up to 10 people — " not counting children , " Merkel said . 
Merkel also announced that mask wearing is now obligatory in all pedestrian high traffic areas and city centers . 
These announcements come after Germany recorded 410 deaths related to coronavirus in the past 24 hours — the highest single day jump in fatalities since the outbreak began , the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , the country 's disease and control agency , said on Wednesday .
