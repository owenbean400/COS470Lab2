German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed her concerns over Germany 's next steps in confronting the coronavirus at a press conference in Berlin on Monday . 
Preventing a relapse is not only in the interest of ourselves but also for our economy and social and public life , she said . 
Merkel cautioned against the false notion that life will soon be safe , and addressed reports saying she was unhappy about discussions involving Germany reopening . 
She said Germany does not want to see what has happened in other countries . 
' The wiggle room we have here — that we have given ourselves — this room for maneuver is being implemented primarily by the federal states through the ordinances and the law governing infectious diseases . " 
" To ensure we interpret this latitude we have given ourselves as narrowly as possible and not as broadly as possible , otherwise I fear we run the risk of not being able to keep the loosening restrictions under control . " 
When asked how she spent her weekend , the German Chancellor smiled and answered , " I obeyed all rules that were submitted . "
