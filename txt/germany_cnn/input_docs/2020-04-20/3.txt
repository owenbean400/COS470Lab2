The southern German state of Bavaria is to make it compulsory to wear masks in all shops and on public transport , Prime Minister Markus Söder announced Monday . 
Speaking in Bavaria 's state parliament , Söder said it would introduce " oral and nose protection obligation " from next week , adding that " some people also call it a mask obligation . " 
Söder said mouth and nose protection would play a " very central role " in containing the further spread of the coronavirus . 
Bavaria is the first state in western Germany to introduce such regulations , Söder said . 
The eastern state of Saxony introduced mandatory mouth and nose protection last week . 
Mecklenburg Western Pomerania , also in the former east , has also introduced mask regulations , which will apply from April 27 -- as in Bavaria . 
Opinions among experts vary as to how effective wearing a mask is to counter coronavirus , but more countries and regions have now made it compulsory to wear them in public . 
Bavaria is the German state with the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths . 
As of Monday , Germany 's largest state had recorded 37,849 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 1,286 fatalities , according to the Robert Koch institute , Germany 's center for disease control .
