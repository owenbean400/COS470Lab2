A German airlines Lufthana owned cargo team is gearing up to push out the potential Pfizer coronavirus vaccine once it is approved . 
CNN went inside this pharmaceutical logistics hub in Germany , which is the biggest in Europe . 
The timeline for transportation at this hub is quick . 
" They come here , they want to spend as little time as possible in a place like this , and then get it out , " CNN 's Fred Pleitgen reported . 
Once the approval comes , things can move quickly . 
However , there are logistical challenges . 
Currently , the vaccine needs to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius , which is about 50 degrees colder than any vaccine currently used in the United States . 
So the coronavirus vaccines will be transported in special cooling containers that can be cooled down to minus 105 degrees Fahrenheit by using big amounts of dried ice . 
Here 's the challenge : The colder a vaccine needs to be stored , the more difficult it is to transport that vaccine . 
And the more dried ice you put in a container , the less space it will have for vaccines . 
This cooling container setup also emits a lot of carbon dioxide , and too much of it in an airplane cabin can be dangerous for the crew . 
This puts another layer of limits on how much you can transport in a single round . 
Take a look at the distribution facility and setup :
