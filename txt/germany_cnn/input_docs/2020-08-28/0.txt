Germany will introduce tougher measures to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country ahead of the autumn and winter season , including new travel regulations , Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Thursday . 
Speaking during a news conference after a meeting with federal and state government leaders , Merkel added that Germany has ' ' come through this pandemic well " so far , but cautioned that new measures would be needed to tackle the rise in the infection rate . 
The new restrictions include : In most states , a fine of 50 euros ( $ 59 ) for people who fail to wear face coverings in public spaces . 
A ban on large scale gatherings , including concerts and sporting events , has been extended until the end of the year . 
Travelers have been advised to avoid all non essential travel to high risk areas . 
Those returning from such areas will now be required to self isolate for at least five days before being permitted to take a coronavirus test . 
Latest numbers : Confirmed Covid 19 cases have , over recent weeks , risen to levels not seen since the end of April in Germany . 
On Friday , the country 's public health agency , the Robert Koch Institute , confirmed that at least 1,571 new infections had been recorded , bringing the total to 239,507 cases and 9,288 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak . 
Concerns over the spike in cases have also led authorities in Berlin to ban a protest planned to take place this weekend against the German government 's coronavirus restrictions , citing concerns over hygiene regulations ; organizers , however , say they will continue to demonstrate , in defiance of the ban .
