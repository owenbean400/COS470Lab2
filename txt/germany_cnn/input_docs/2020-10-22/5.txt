Germany will require arrivals from the UK to quarantine for 14 days starting Saturday , according to guidance released Thursday by the German Missions in the United Kingdom . 
Starting Saturday , Germany will classify the UK as a " COVID high risk area , " with the exception of the Isle of Man , Jersey and Guernsey . 
" The United Kingdom has been strongly affected by COVID 19 , " according to the German Missions in the United Kingdom . 
" Passengers travelling from these high risk areas must therefore undergo a 14 day quarantine upon entering Germany , unless they can provide a COVID 19 test that is no older than 48 hours , or get a test done upon arrival and it is negative . 
Those who get a test done upon arrival , must undergo quarantine until the result has arrived . "
