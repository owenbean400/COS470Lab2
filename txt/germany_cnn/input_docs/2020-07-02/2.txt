Self isolation measures have been lifted for people traveling to England from " lower risk countries , " such as Germany , France , Spain and Italy , according to UK 's Department of Transport . 
The new measures will go into effect July 10 and a list of countries exempt from self isolation upon arrival to England will be published Friday , the Transport Department said . 
" A risk assessment has been conducted by the Joint Biosecurity Centre , in close consultation with Public Health England and the Chief Medical Officer . 
The assessment draws on a range of factors including the prevalence of coronavirus , the numbers of new cases and potential trajectory of the disease in that destination , " the department 's statement read . 
Those traveling from countries on the exemption list will not be required to self isolate , " unless they have been in or transited through non exempt countries in the preceding 14 days . " 
" The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage , therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with , " Shapps said in the statement .
