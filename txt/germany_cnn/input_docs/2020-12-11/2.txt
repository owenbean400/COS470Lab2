German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has warned that new coronavirus infections are growing " exponentially again " and said politicians need to " act now " in order to curb the spread of coronavirus . 
Speaking on Public TV on Thursday , Altmaier said " the exponential growth is reoccurring , and this means we urgently have to act now if do not want to get things entirely out of control . " 
' ' We need to see the infections numbers drop significantly by the beginning of next year , " Altmaier added . 
On Friday , Germany recorded a record number of infections and a record death toll over a 24 hour period , with 29,875 new cases and 598 deaths . 
Data from the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine ( DIVI ) showed Thursday the number of Covid 19 patients admitted to intensive care units in Germany also reached an all time high . 
DIVI reported 4,339 patients being treated in intensive care facilities . 
Nearly 60 % of patients in ICUs need ventilation and around 4,753 ICU beds are still vacant , figures showed . 
On Thursday , the country 's agency for disease control , the Robert Koch Institute , warned people to reduce contacts by more than 60 % on their own or face tougher restrictions . 
Weeks of a partial national lockdown have not slowed the spread of coronavirus infections enough . 
Earlier this week German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she wants to implement a full lockdown for as long as two weeks after Christmas to bring down infection numbers . 
Merkel is set to meet with Germany 's sixteen federal state premiers Sunday to set out a coordinated plan on a full potential nationwide lockdown .
