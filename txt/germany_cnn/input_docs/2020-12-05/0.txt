Mandatory mask usage in parts of Germany last spring helped significantly reduce the number of new Covid 19 infections , a team of German researchers reported in a new analysis . 
The team used public data on coronavirus cases to compare regions with and without mandatory mask policies last April . 
The study , which was published Thursday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , also found that certain age groups benefited more from mask usage . 
The researchers looked at data from mask use in Jena , a city in central Germany , after a mandatory mask policy took effect between April 1-10 . 
They compared Jena â€™s mandatory mask policy with a control group , a similar city that experienced comparable growth in coronavirus cases before the mandatory mask policy in Jena . 
They found a " significant difference " in Covid 19 case reductions in Jena . 
" Our findings indicate that the early introduction of face masks in Jena has resulted in a drop in newly registered COVID 19 cases of around 75 % after 20 days , " the team reported . 
" Put simply , if the control region observes 100 new infections over a period of 20 days , the mask region observes only 25 cases , " they wrote . 
" This drop is greatest , by more than 90 % , for the age group 60 years and above . " 
The study also concluded that , given the low cost compared to other public health measures , masks are a cost effective way to combat the spread of coronavirus . 
The analysis did not look at the different types of face masks and whether that could have affected the conclusion . 
Previous studies on the use of face masks in public have also they reduce the spread of Covid - 19 .
