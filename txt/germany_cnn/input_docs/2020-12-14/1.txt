German Health Minister Jens Spahn has called on the European Medicines Agency to speed up the approval process for the Pfizer Bio NTech vaccine . 
" This is also about people â€™s trust in the ability of the European Union to act , " Spahn added . 
Germany is seeing a surge in both coronavirus infections and deaths . 
The country is close to finishing construction of dozens of vaccination centers across the country to distribute the vaccines once they are approved , Spahn wrote . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Sunday that the country will go into a " hard " national lockdown , starting next week and continuing through the Christmas period .
