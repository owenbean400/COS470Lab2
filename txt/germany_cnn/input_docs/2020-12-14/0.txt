Germany will go into a " hard " national lockdown , starting next week and continuing through the Christmas period , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday , after agreeing to stricter measures with state governments to stem a wave of coronavirus cases . 
As of next Wednesday , all non essential shops , services and schools will close until January 10 , and Christmas Day gatherings will be reduced from 10 people to only five from two different households . 
This week , Merkel made an impassioned plea for Germans to limit their social contacts ahead of the holidays : despite the country 's respected health system and early success in containing the virus , a recent partial lockdown has failed to stop the second wave surge . 
Germany reported record daily deaths on Friday , with 598 fatalities tallied in a span of 24 hours . 
The new measures take aim at traditional festivities : Christmas church services will be subject to prior registration with no singing allowed , alcohol is to be banned from all public spaces and an annual New Year 's Eve fireworks display will be canceled . 
Some states are also implementing additional measures , such as Bavaria , which will have a 9 p.m . curfew . 
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has pledged economic help for all businesses affected by the lockdown . 
Case numbers : On Sunday , Germany recorded 20,200 new coronavirus infections -- 2,000 more than Sunday last week -- according to the Robert Koch Institute , the country 's agency for disease control . 
The overall infection number stands at 1,320,716 .
