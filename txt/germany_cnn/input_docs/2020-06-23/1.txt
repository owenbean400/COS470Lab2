The German state of North Rhine Westphalia has imposed a new lockdown in the area around a meat factory hit by a coronavirus outbreak . 
The district where the Toennies meat processing plant is located -- and the scene of a Covid 19 cluster that has sickened some 1,553 workers -- will return to lockdown measures , the Prime Minister of North Rhine Westfalia announced Tuesday . 
Armin Laschet said the restrictions in Guetersloh would be valid for a week until June 30 and would be similar to the lockdown measures introduced in March . 
The outbreak in the meatpacking plant has been linked to a spike in Germany 's overall coronavirus reproduction rate by the country â€™s public health body . 
The cluster prompted the closure of daycare centers and schools in the region , and the army was deployed to aid testing efforts . 
The lockdown measures will include no group contact , and all restaurants , pubs , bars , swimming pools and fitness studios will be closed . 
Meanwhile , the district of Guetersloh is trying to improve communication with the workers at Toennies and has called for volunteer translators . 
Officials have said that the workers being tested are mostly from Romania , Bulgaria and Poland , and on Tuesday , the district announced it is looking for 150 translators until the end of September .
