A large scale study has found that early interventions , such as social distancing and severe restrictions on peoples â€™ movement , have been critical in restraining the spread of coronavirus and have already saved tens of thousands of lives across Europe . 
Scientists at Imperial College London studied interventions in 11 European countries , and concluded that they " have together had a substantial impact on transmission . " 
They estimate " that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March . " 
The researchers caution against relaxing restrictions , saying that " many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels . " 
And they warn , " for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be certain that recent interventions have been effective . " 
In Italy , their results suggest that 5.9 million people had been infected as of March 28 , or 9.8 % of the population . 
For Spain , they believe 15 % of the population has been infected . 
The study does warn that " many interventions have occurred only recently , and their effects have not yet been fully observed due to the time lag between infection and death . " 
Germany , for example , is estimated to have one of the lowest " attack rates " at 0.7 % , with 600,000 people infected . 
But it is at an earlier stage in coronavirus spread than Spain or Italy . 
But they strike a note of hope in their conclusions , saying : " we cannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in Europe ; however , if current trends continue , there is reason for optimism . "
