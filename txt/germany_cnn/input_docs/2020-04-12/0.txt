The UK is " likely to be one of the worst , if not the worst , affected countries in Europe , " Jeremy Farrar , director of the Wellcome Trust and a UK government adviser said Sunday . 
" The numbers in the UK have continued to go up , I do hope that we 're coming close to the number of new infections reducing , and in a week or two the number of people of people needing hospital reducing , " he said , adding that he hoped the number of UK deaths would plateau and start to fall in a couple of weeks . 
He told BBC 's Andrew Marr that Germany had so far managed to keep its numbers low by introducing testing at a " remarkable " scale early on and isolating those who had contracted the virus . 
Farrar also said a second or third wave of coronavirus was " probably inevitable . " 
He said he thought a vaccine will be available during autumn this year , but that it will not be available on the scale required to protect people around the world .
