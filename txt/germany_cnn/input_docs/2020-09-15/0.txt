Germany 's Education and Research minister does not expect a coronavirus vaccine to be broadly available before mid 2021 . 
Anja Maria Antonia Karliczek spoke at a government news briefing Tuesday , where the country 's Health Minister Jens Spahn said that between 55 and 65 % of its citizens would need to be vaccinated once the treatment has been found . 
Spahn said he wanted to know more about the Russian vaccine , which has been approved by Moscow before Phase 3 trials . 
Spahn also said he was certain there was a willingness in the population to get tested and that Germany had enough information on Covid 19 to avoid a second lockdown . 
Germany 's Ministry of Education and Research will also grant funds to biotechnology companies Curevac and Bio NTech for the development of a coronavirus vaccine . 
Curevac will receive € 252 million ( $ 300 million ) and Bio NTech will receive € 375 million .
