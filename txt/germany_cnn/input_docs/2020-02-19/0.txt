Simply checking travelers for symptoms such as fever or cough is not enough to avoid spreading the novel coronavirus , a new report by German researchers said Tuesday . 
Published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the paper assessed the screening process used on 126 people who were evacuated from Wuhan , China , to Germany . 
Despite going through multiple screenings once arriving in Germany , two of the travelers ultimately tested positive for the coronavirus . 
" A symptom based screening process was ineffective for detecting ( the virus ) , " the paper said . 
Virus may live on surfaces for days : There is still much we do not know about the novel coronavirus , including how long it can survive on surfaces outside the human body . 
The Chinese government is taking no chances , even cleaning or destroying cash which has been known to be touched by infected patients . 
A new study has suggested that might be wise -- some coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) could survive on surfaces for up to nine days .
