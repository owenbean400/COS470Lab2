German Health Minister Jens Spahn tweeted Wednesday that 1.3 million Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine doses will be distributed in the country by the end of 2020 in preparation for a mass vaccination of the population next year . 
" We will be able to distribute 1.3 million vaccine doses through Bio NTech to the federal states by the end of this year " , the tweet reads , adding that the rollout of the vaccine will start Sunday , " particularly in care homes " . 
Last week , Spahn said that every second person dying in Germany due to Covid 19 is over 80 years old . 
Therefore , vaccination would go to over 80s and care home residents and staff as he called on fellow citizens to be patient with the vaccine rollout on 27 December . 
In his tweet Wednesday , Spahn added that subject to all regulatory approvals for three vaccines , he is hoping that all residents could receive vaccinations against Covid 19 by summer 2021 . 
He did not go into detail on how the ambitious rollout would be achieved . 
On Monday , the European Union authorized the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine , with the first phase of the bloc 's mass vaccination program to begin later this month . 
The move finalizes the recommendation of the European Union drugs regulator , who , just hours before , had granted the vaccine a conditional marketing authorization and paved the way for it to become the first Covid 19 shot distributed in the bloc .
