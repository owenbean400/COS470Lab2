Drivers stranded in miles of traffic at Kent in the southeast of England are still not moving , according to the French National Road Haulage Federation . 
A spokeswoman , Vanessa Ibarlucea , told CNN that drivers have not been given covid tests , water , or food and are " crammed on top of each other . " 
Ibarlucea says her federation and other French haulage associations will gather later this morning and prepare a joint statement calling for action . 
The German Haulage Association says it is trying to lift driving hour restrictions for truckers over the coming Christmas holidays in an effort to get the drivers -- a lot of them from Eastern Europe driving through Germany -- home quickly . 
There is a ban on truckers driving over public holidays and Sundays in Germany . 
The BGL EV also reminded its members that the Port of Dover , as well as Eurotunnel , ask for a negative coronavirus test before drivers present themselves at those terminals on the UK side . 
" Both operators are urgently pointing out that drivers should under no circumstances try to drive up to the terminals without a negative test result , " the BGL EV says in a notice sent out to its members .
