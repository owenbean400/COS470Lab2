Germany has been easing its lockdown : Last week , Chancellor Angela Merkel laid out a list of steps the country would undertake to begin lifting its lockdown , and on Monday stores up to 800 square meters in size began reopening , as long as they have hygiene and social distancing measures in place . 
Bookshops , car dealerships and bike stores can also now reopen regardless of their size . 
Restaurants , bars and gyms will remain closed . 
Merkel also announced that the country would increase its contact tracing efforts , deploying a team of five officers for every 20,000 people in the population to trace those who may have come into recent contact with every confirmed case .
