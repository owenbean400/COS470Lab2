Chancellor Angela Merkel has appealed to Germans to reduce their social contact over the Christmas period , telling lawmakers on Wednesday that scientists are " practically begging " citizens to stick to the scientific guidance . 
" The number of contacts is too high , the reduction of contacts is not enough , " Merkel said in the German parliament . 
" I ’m sorry , I really am sorry from the bottom of my heart , but if the price we pay is 590 deaths a day , then that is unacceptable in my view , " she added . 
Addressing members of parliament , Merkel said restrictions introduced at the beginning of November had not proven effective , with high numbers of coronavirus related deaths and ICU admissions still being reported ahead of the holiday period . 
" If we have too many contacts now in the run up to Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with our grandparents , then we will have done something wrong . 
We should not let this happen , " she said . 
The Chancellor ’s remarks come the day after Germany recorded its highest number of coronavirus related deaths , with 590 recorded on Tuesday alone , according to the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) . 
Germany is struggling to stem a surge in coronavirus cases , with 20,815 new cases confirmed on Wednesday . 
Several German states are also expected to tighten lockdown measures next week in an effort to bring the outbreak under control , including the state of Saxony , which will go into what officials there call a " hard lockdown , " closing most shops and moving all school classes online .
