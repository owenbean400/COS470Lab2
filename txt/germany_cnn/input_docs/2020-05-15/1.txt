Germany ’s coronavirus reproduction rate has fallen to 0.75 , according to the country ’s disease and control center -- a small but hopeful decrease . 
It had previously been 0.81 , according to the Robert Koch Institute . 
The reproduction rate , also known as the R value , indicates how much the virus is spreading ; an R value of 1 means each infected person is transmitting it to one other person . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly warned that if the number rises above 1 , the country 's health system would eventually be overwhelmed . 
The Robert Koch Institute says a total of 3.1 million coronavirus tests have been carried out in Germany since the outbreak began . 
The country has reported 174,478 cases and 7,884 related deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
But this does not reflect the total number of active cases ; at least 151,700 people have recovered from the virus , according to the institute .
