President Trump cited misleading statistics about coronavirus cases in Europe during a press briefing Tuesday , claiming inaccurately that right now the US is handling the pandemic better than other countries . 
" Not that I want to bring that up , " he added , " but might as well explain it to the media . " 
" The seven day case average for Germany has increased by 62 % since last week , unfortunately , and that is truly unfortunate . 
It ’s increased 82 % in France , 113 % in Spain , and 30 % in the United Kingdom . 
Those are big increases . 
Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands , Sweden , Belgium , Switzerland , Slovakia , Estonia and other European counties . 
And in our country , they ’re going down . 
We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by , short time , " the President claimed . 
It ’s true that cases are rapidly rising in Europe , but the numbers are nowhere near the level of infection in the United States . 
The US added 49,536 new cases on Monday , a day that consistently sees lower numbers . 
The US is averaging 54,409 new cases over the last seven days , which is up slightly from the previous few days . 
However , the percent change from the prior week in cases is down 10 % , not 20 % as the President claimed . 
This is also slightly lower than last week , when the US dipped down 16 % compared to the prior week in this metric , according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University .
