Germany will need " billions of masks " to fight its coronavirus outbreak , the Bavarian state premier Markus Soder said Thursday . 
" In the long run , we will need enormous amounts of masks , " Soder said . 
" I believe that in the end we will need billions of masks in Germany . " 
He said the masks would initially be needed by medical staff and then the elderly people in nursing homes . 
Germany â€™s Health Minister Jens Spahn wants the country to become less dependent on masks made elsewhere , advocating that Germany should make more . 
" We must become more independent of the world market , for the security of our citizens . 
That is one of the lessons of these weeks . 
We want to encourage companies with a purchase guarantee until the end of 2021 to set up production of protective masks in Germany , " he said on Twitter . 
The number of coronavirus cases in Germany is continuing to rise rapidly . 
The worse affected region is Bavaria , which has more than 18,000 confirmed cases and 268 deaths , according to data from the Robert Koch Institute . 
Bavaria became the first German state to implement a lockdown on public life in an attempt to curb coronavirus spread .
