The German military will mobilize 15,000 soldiers starting Friday to support regional authorities in the fight against coronavirus . 
The soldiers will be used to protect critical infrastructure , distribute medical equipment and set up makeshift hospitals . 
Germany 's defense minister Annegret Kramp Karrenbauer told state broadcaster ARD that this is the first time such a contingent of soldiers has been deployed in this way .
