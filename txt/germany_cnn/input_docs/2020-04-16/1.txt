President Trump ’s announcement on Tuesday that the US will halt its funding to the World Health Organization while a review is conducted is a " big setback " for the international response to coronavirus , German Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday . 
" The United States of America has been a longstanding partner and financial supporter of the World Health Organization … if they were to freeze their funding for the organization , that would be a big setback , " Spahn told CNN ’s Christiane Amanpour . 
" Our position is that , in times like this , we need international cooperation , and the role of the WHO in this is crucial , " he added , asserting that the WHO has Germany ’s " full " support . 
On Tuesday , Trump told reporters that he would halt funding to the WHO while a review into the organization ’s management of the coronavirus pandemic is conducted . 
Spahn argued that any review of the organization ought to be carried out after the pandemic is overcome . 
" Of course , we have to debate the lessons learned and we have to reflect on what went wrong and what can be done better , but that should be done after we overcome this , " Spahn said .
