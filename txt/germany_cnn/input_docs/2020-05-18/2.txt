A home housing refugees in western Germany has been hit by a coronavirus outbreak , a Cologne district government press officer told CNN . 
The refugee accommodation in Sankt Augustin , Germany recorded its first case last Friday , Vanessa Nolte said . 
Since then 120 refugees , out of a total of 489 who are registered there , have tested positive . 
Only 312 of the residents were actually tested for coronavirus , as the inhabitants are not confined to the home , but can come and go , Nolte said . 
In addition , 10 staff members have tested positive for the virus , she said . 
The refugees are mostly young people and families , Nolte said ; she could not give information on their nationalities . 
The refugee accommodation was immediately put into full quarantine , meaning no one could enter or leave , and authorities are in the process of separating the positive from the negative cases . 
This is proving challenging as some of the inhabitants do not want to be moved , the press officer added .
