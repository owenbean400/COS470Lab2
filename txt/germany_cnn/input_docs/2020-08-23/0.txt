Ever since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered clubs , bars and concert halls around the world , music fans have been dreaming of the day they can once again visit a busy , sweaty venue to enjoy a gig with friends . 
With infection rates rising in many European countries , this dream could be far off . 
But some music fans in Leipzig , Germany , have been given the chance to rock for a day in the name of science -- with the help of some glowing hand sanitizer and electronic trackers . 
Researchers in the German city of Leipzig staged a 1,500 person experimental indoor concert on Saturday to better understand how Covid 19 spreads at big , busy events , and how to prevent it . 
At the gig , which featured a live performance from musician Tim Bendzko , fans were given respiratory face masks , fluorescent hand gel and electronic " contact trackers " -- small transmitters that determine the contact rates and contact distances of the individual experiment participants . 
Using data from the contact trackers , scientists from The University of Halle will monitor the number " critical contacts " had by each participant during specific times and locations , while the residue left by fluorescent hand gel will identify frequently touched surfaces . 
Researchers hope to use the data to find ways to bring big events , including sports , back safely . 
Professor Michael Gekle , the dean of the university 's medical faculty and a professor of physiology , told CNN the experiment was being conducted to better prepare authorities on how to conduct events in the upcoming autumn and winter seasons .
