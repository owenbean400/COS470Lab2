Germany has on Friday recorded the highest number of new daily infections since early May , according to data published Saturday by Germany ’s center for disease prevention , The Robert Koch Institute . 
The country saw 955 new coronavirus cases . 
The last time Germany recorded a higher number was May 9 . 
The pandemic had largely been brought under control in Germany earlier this summer , but the government has been warning about new outbreaks of the disease in recent weeks . 
The Robert Koch Institute said laxer enforcement of distancing and hygiene rules , as well as travelers returning from abroad are to blame for the steep rise in cases . 
" The number of 955 new infections is alarming . 
Especially since it is not large ' hot spots ' but smaller clusters of infections , " Germany 's economy minister Peter Altmaier said on Twitter on Saturday . 
" The main risks need to clearly be named so that more targeted prevention becomes possible , " he added . 
Starting Saturday everyone coming to Germany will be able to get a free coronavirus test within 72 hours of arrival , according to a new directive from Germany ’s health ministry .
