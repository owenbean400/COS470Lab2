Germans should prepare for another four to five months of significant precautions and restrictions , and should not speculate about when measures can be relaxed , German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag . 
Altmaier praised " the discipline of the people " during the country â€™s second lockdown , but warned that the number of infections is still " too high " and that the country is " not out of the woods yet . 
Despite all efforts , a change for the better has not yet been achieved . " 
By the numbers : The country reported 16,947 new coronavirus cases and 107 deaths on Sunday according to the Robert Koch Institute . 
Weekend figures tend to be lower however as not all data is reported by local authorities . 
The total number of cases in the country was 790,503 on Sunday . 
Germany is currently two weeks into a nationwide partial lockdown which requires restaurant and bars to remain closed , people to avoid travel , " keep their contacts to an absolute minimum " and limit public meetings to members of two different households . 
Schools and shops have remained open . 
" The wave of infections must be broken permanently . 
We cannot afford a yo yo shutdown with the economy opening and closing all the time , " Altmaier responded when asked about an extension to the current partial lockdown .
