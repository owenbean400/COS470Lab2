The German state of Bavaria has declared a state of emergency as the country 's economics ministry issued a stark warning . 
Markus Soeder , premier of the southern state bordering Switzerland and Austria , said on Monday in Munich that " the situation is very serious and changing every day , unfortunately not for the better . " 
Meanwhile , in a statement released Monday , the German Ministry for Economics said that the coronavirus outbreak was affecting the country 's economy . 
" How strong and for how long cannot yet be reliably assessed because no meaningful economic data are available yet , " read the statement . 
" It is also still too uncertain how fast and how much the coronavirus will spread . 
Due to the very dynamic development , however , relevant economic effects must be expected . 
" The German economy was in the process of overcoming the phase of weakness which had persisted since the beginning of 2018 , related to the global industrial recession and the trade conflicts ... 
This is no longer expected . "
