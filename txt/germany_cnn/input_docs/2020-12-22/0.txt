Germany has extended its travel ban from the UK until January 6 â€“ despite the European Commission on Tuesday recommending member states scrap the ban . 
" From December 22nd , 2020 until January 6th , 2021 inclusive , there is a transport ban for travelers from the United Kingdom to Germany , i.e . transport companies are prohibited from transporting travelers to Germany , " the updated travel advisory said on Tuesday . 
The advisory clarified that " a German citizen who wants to enter Germany at the border will not be refused . " 
" From January 1 , 2021 , people with residence and right of residence in Germany can be transported again . 
The federal government must approve the flights individually . 
The airline will obtain this approval . 
Travelers do not need individual permits , " the note added . 
Earlier on Tuesday , the European Commission said : " While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus and all non essential travel to and from the UK should be discouraged , essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated .
