Partners of Danish citizens will now be able to reunite with their significant others after Denmark lifted some coronavirus border restrictions on Monday , Danish Police and the Danish Justice Ministry told CNN . 
The eased border controls apply only to permanent residents of Denmark 's neighboring countries — Germany , Sweden , Norway and Finland . 
Currently , the rules require those who are engaged or in a relationship to show police proof that the relationship has been ongoing for at least six months . 
However , following privacy concerns , authorities are in the process of updating the law to require only a signed declaration . 
" The police requested people to prove the relationship by showing proof . 
The proof could be love letters or photos or things like that , but that was changed yesterday by the Minister of Justice , " a Danish police spokesperson said , Danish Minister of Justice Nick Hækkerup said there may be some situations where extra control is needed from the police , but as a starting point , it is enough to sign the statement . 
" If it turns out that 500,000 German partners suddenly come to Denmark , then you might say , there are probably some who are cheating with the rules , " he said . 
The eased border controls will also allow people to visit grandparents or visit their holiday homes in Denmark — all considered " worthy purposes . " 
All other travelers without a worthy purpose " will be refused entry to Denmark at all internal and external borders , " according to the police . 
The border relaxation is the latest step in Denmark 's plan for a " controlled reopening " following coronavirus restrictions . 
The Ministry of Justice said it is also in close dialogue with the Nordic countries and Germany regarding the next steps in the reopening and a plan for summer tourism .
