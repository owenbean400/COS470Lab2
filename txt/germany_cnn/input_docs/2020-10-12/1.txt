As German cities face major Covid 19 outbreaks , some popular tourist spots are turning away people visiting from affected areas , due to state regulations . 
But different federal states have different rules , which makes the process more complex . 
Hoteliers in the popular Baltic Sea resort of Warnemuende have had to cancel the bookings of guests from high risk areas such as Berlin , Warnemuende Tourism Center 's public relations manager Anja Thomanek told CNN . 
Thomanek says she hopes regulations in the state—Mecklenburg Vorpommern—will be updated this week so they can accommodate more guests . 
Mecklenburg Vorpommern has set a high bar for accepting guests from Covid 19 hotspots . 
Visitors must produce a recent negative coronavirus test , and then quarantine for 14 days . 
The quarantine period can be reduced to five to seven days if they can provide evidence of a second negative test -- paid for by the visitors themselves . 
Thomanek told CNN that the resort is " very , very , very " well booked nonetheless , most likely because holidaymakers face more difficulty going abroad . 
In Schleswig Holstein , another popular Northern state , the rules for accepting visitors from hotspots are different . 
People heading there from high risk areas only have to say they have had a negative coronavirus test in the past 48 hours . 
Those who have not been in their home district for at least two weeks are exempt from having to present a test . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet with the Prime Ministers of Germany 's federal states on Wednesday to discuss country wide regulations . 
The country has reported 326,499 cases in total .
