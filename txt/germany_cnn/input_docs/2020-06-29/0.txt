Workers at six Amazon German fulfillment centers are going on strike over recent coronavirus cases , German labor union Verdi and Amazon confirmed to CNN . 
Verdi on Sunday called for workers to strike for 48 hours starting Monday , in order to protest the safety at Amazon fulfillment centers amid recent coronavirus infections . 
In Bad Hersfeld , Germany , the union said at least 30 to 40 workers have been infected . 
Verdi also wants Amazon to recognize regional wage agreements for the retail sector . 
" If the company thought we were going to leave it alone because of the coronavirus pandemic , it was wrong , " said Verdi . 
Amazon confirmed the strike in a statement saying the majority of associates were not participating and there was no impact on customer orders . 
" The fact that more than 8,000 of our over 13,000 permanent associates in Germany are with us for more than 5 years proves that we are a fair employer . 
Everything the union demands is already in place : Wages at the upper end from what is paid for similar jobs , career opportunities and a safe working environment , " said an Amazon spokesperson in Germany . 
Amazon said that by the end of June it will have invested approximately $ 4 billion worldwide on Covid related initiatives and that in Germany alone , it has ordered 470 million units of hand disinfectant , 21 million pairs of gloves , 19 million units of face masks , face shields and other mouth nose covers and 39 million units of disinfectant wipes . 
The strikes are taking place in Leipzig , Bad Hersfeld which has two fulfillment centers , Rheinberg , Werne and Koblenz .
