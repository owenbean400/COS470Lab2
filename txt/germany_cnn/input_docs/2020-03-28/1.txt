Merkel calls for patience : From her home quarantine , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the current social distancing measures will remain in place for a while longer and appealed to Germans to be patient . 
" I want to assure you that I know how difficult the restrictions on personal contacts are , which are currently in place for everyone , " Merkel said in an audio message released on Saturday morning . 
" Each and everyone is a key piece in the battle against the virus , " Merkel added , acknowledging that a scaling back of the measures is not in sight . 
Merkel said the number of infections is doubling about every 5.5 days at the moment , which is an improvement compared to a doubling every two days at the beginning . 
But that period must be closer to every 10 days if the health care system is not to be overwhelmed . 
The Chancellor said she understands anxiety about Germany ’s economic situation . 
" No one can say with certainty how long this difficult time will last . 
I have to ask you to be patient , " she said .
