German health authorities expect one or more vaccines against the novel coronavirus will be ready by early 2021 , said the German center for disease prevention on Thursday . 
However , the institute also warns that there could be shortages of new Covid 19 vaccines . 
" It is expected that at the beginning there will not be enough vaccine available for the entire population so that prioritizing will be necessary , " the RKI added . 
Germany currently has several Covid 19 vaccine candidates in various phases of testing . 
Among the most advanced are efforts by Biontech/Pfizer and Cure Vac , both of which have received special grants from the German government to speed up testing and expand production capacities .
