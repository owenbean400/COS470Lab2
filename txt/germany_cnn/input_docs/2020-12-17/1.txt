For the first since the start of the coronavirus pandemic , a German town has acknowledged it has had to activate mobile refrigerated containers after hospital morgues became overwhelmed by an increasing number of deaths . 
" We are forced for the first time to use the cooling container for coronavirus deaths because the clinics in Hanau are overwhelmed , " Claus Kaminsky -- the mayor of the town of Hanau near Frankfurt -- wrote on his Twitter feed . 
" It is extremely sad that we are in this horrible situation , " Kaminsky added . 
According to a statement from the city , Hanau has been renting the unit since April but has never had to activate it until now . 
" Mayor Claus Kaminsky regrets a further escalation of the pandemic situation , " the statement added . 
" This has led to the cooling container at the main cemetery in Hanau having to be used for the first time for two COVID 19 fatalities . " 
Germany is currently seeing a major surge in coronavirus infections and deaths . 
On Tuesday the country â€™s center for disease control recorded its highest ever single day death toll , with 952 fatalities reported .
