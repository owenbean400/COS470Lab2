German scientists have developed a method that could dramatically increase the capacity to test for coronavirus , the Science Ministry of the German State of Hessen says . 
The new method allows for several samples to be evaluated at once , the Ministry wrote in a press release , adding that this will allow for an " increase in the test capacity in Germany from about 40,000 tests per day to about 200,000 to 400,000 tests per day without any loss of quality in the diagnostics . " 
Normally , the various swabs taken during currents tests from the mouth and nose area and all separately evaluated . 
With the new method , scientists put several of the probes into a single , special solution and test them with the so called PCR method , which directly detects the SARS Co V 2 genome . 
If the total result is negative , then it is clear that the separate swabs are all negative , the press release says and adds , " if the result is positive , then all the swabs have to be evaluated separately . "
