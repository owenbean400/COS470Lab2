The Trump administration â€™s new restrictions banning travel from 26 European countries could cost the US travel industry billions of dollars , according to the US Travel Association . 
The 30 day suspension , which begins Friday at midnight , marks a sharp escalation of measures taken to insulate Americans from the coronavirus outbreak . 
The travel restriction extends to countries in the Schengen zone , which includes Italy , Germany , France , Spain and 22 other nations . 
The United Kingdom is not included . 
Why this will hit hard : Thousands of Europeans visit America every month -- and during that time , they spend a lot of money . 
About 850,000 international visitors flying from Europe -- excluding the United Kingdom -- entered the United States in March 2019 , accounting for about 29 % of total overseas arrivals to the country , according to US Travel Association economists . 
Those visitors spent some $ 3.4 billion in the United States . 
US citizens and permanent residents who are in Europe will still be allowed back into the United States during the 30 day period , though will be screened upon entry and face quarantine or restrictions on their movement . 
Even so , it remains unclear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up because of the ban .
