The number of coronavirus cases in Germany jumped by 2,958 in the last 24 hours to a total of 13,957 , the head of the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , Germany 's federal public health agency , said Friday . 
There have been 31 total deaths as a result of coronavirus , with 11 fatalities in the last 24 hours , said RKI chief Lothar Wieler at a press conference in Berlin . 
' ' We will see more fatalities over the next few weeks -- including here in Germany , " Wieler said . 
The head of the RKI also warned about hospital capacity in the country . 
" More people will get infected ; more people will be admitted to the emergency room and more people will require respiratory aid and therefore we have to fear that there will not be enough ventilator places , " Wieler said . 
Germany is only at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak , Wieler warned . 
He urged people to keep their distance to fight the pandemic , but said it is up to local authorities to decide on specific measures designed to achieve that . 
He went on to issue a stark warning . 
" If everyone sticks to what is set , we can slow down this epidemic by the maximum possible . "
