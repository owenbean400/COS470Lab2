The UK government should reverse its decision to relax Covid 19 restrictions over Christmas according to health experts , who warn hospitalizations at New Year could match that of the pandemic ’s peak in April unless tighter measures are brought in . 
The British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) and the Health Service Journal ( HSJ ) issued a rare joint plea -- only the second in more than 100 years -- on Tuesday , calling on the government to scrap its " rash decision " to allow household mixing for five days . 
Authors Alastair Mc Lellan ( HSJ ) and Fiona Godlee ( BMJ ) , said it was imperative that the government stops households from socializing in order to bring down infections and spare the UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) from struggling to cope with a third wave . 
" When government devised the current plans to allow household mixing over Christmas it had assumed the Covid 19 demand on the NHS would be decreasing . 
But it is not , it is rising , and the emergence of a new strain of the virus has introduced further potential jeopardy , " it said . 
They advised that rather than lifting restrictions over Christmas as currently planned , the UK should follow the more cautious examples of Germany , Italy and the Netherlands . 
Tiered restrictions should also be reviewed and strengthened as they are currently doing little to suppress the virus , the authors added . 
Despite most of the country under Tier 2 " high alert " or the " very high " Tier 3 restrictions , numbers of inpatients have started to rise again . 
On Monday , Covid 19 bed occupancy at hospitals in England had climbed to 15,053 . 
The authors predict that hospitals in England will have just short of 19,000 coronavirus patients on New Year ’s Eve , almost exactly the same as the 18,974 peak of the first wave of the pandemic on April 12 . 
At least 64,500 people in the UK have now died after contracting coronavirus .
