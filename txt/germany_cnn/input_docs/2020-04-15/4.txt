Germany will start to relax nationwide Covid 19 restrictions next week on some shops , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday . 
The shops , which must meet certain size requirements , will be allowed to reopen if hygiene plans are followed , Merkel said Wednesday . 
Schools will gradually reopen on May 4 with priority given to primary and secondary students in their final years . 
At the same time , the country is extending its ' ' contact ban ' ' in the fight against coronavirus until May 3 , Merkel said . 
Germany 's contact ban rules that no more than two people can meet in public , unless people live in the same household . 
Large public events are banned until the end of August to prevent mass transmission of the virus . 
' ' Any further relaxation of lockdown will depend on how infection rate develops â€” we have little room to maneuver , " Merkel said . 
She went on to say that face masks should be worn in shops and public transport .
