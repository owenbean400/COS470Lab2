An experimental coronavirus vaccine entering human trials in the US may be available in many millions of doses by the end of 2020 , the CEO of Bio NTech has told CNN . 
The German drug maker has partnered with US giant Pfizer to distribute a potential vaccine which is already in human trials in Germany . 
CEO Ugur Şahin believes the regulatory approval process could be sped up from what is historically an 18 month time frame due to the global pandemic . 
Şahin believes Covid 19 will be responsive to a vaccine which is he calls the " most important aspect " of vaccine development . 
He said the second aspect is the " very encouraging " pre clinical data . 
" We see vaccine responses , we see strong vaccine responses at even low doses . 
And we believe that this vaccine response , since we have seen that in different animal models will also translate into vaccine responses in human subjects , " Şahin said . 
If it is approved by the regulators , Şahin said the partners are " prepared to go as fast as possible " to get the vaccine to the population .
