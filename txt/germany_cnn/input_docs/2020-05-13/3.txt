German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be depressing to return to restrictions " because we want too much too soon " as the country starts to ease lockdown measures . 
Speaking in parliament Wednesday , Merkel said the country will have to live with the virus and it will remain that way for some time to come . 
Stressing the importance of trying to avoid a new spike in Covid 19 cases , Merkel said : " We have the obligation to not jeopardize what we have achieved so far already . " 
Merkel said , as of today , she was not expecting tax rises or rises in business contributions in response to the pandemic . 
The reproduction number for the novel coronavirus in Germany has dipped back below the key threshold of one , the national agency for disease control and prevention , the Robert Koch Institute , said earlier on Wednesday . 
Also known as the R0 value , the figure had been above one for three consecutive days , a sign the disease may have been expanding rather than being pushed back . 
" The decline in new infections which we have seen in the past weeks is flattening and may be reaching a plateau , " the Institute wrote in its daily data brief . 
Germany continues to deal with several larger scale outbreaks in meat processing plants and retirement homes as the country eases restrictions to combat the pandemic . 
Official daily data from Tuesday showed 798 new infections and 101 Covid 19 related deaths during that 24 hour period .
