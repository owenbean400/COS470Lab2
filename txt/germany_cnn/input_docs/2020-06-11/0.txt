People in the US and Europe are sleeping more because of the Covid 19 pandemic , according to two new pieces of research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology . 
One study found students were staying up later and sleeping longer . 
Another found some Europeans were staying in bed about a quarter of an hour longer , on average , since the pandemic . 
Kenneth Wright and colleagues of the department of Integrative Physiology at the University of Colorado , Boulder , compared the sleep schedules of 139 university students before and during the pandemic . 
They found students were spending an average of 30 minutes longer sleeping on weekdays and around 24 minutes on weekends . 
Plus , more students were getting the recommended seven or more hours of sleep a night . 
For weekdays , this number went from 84 % to 92 % . 
Along with sleeping longer , students were also going to bed late about 50 minutes later on average on weekdays and 24 minutes on weekends . 
The second study , carried out by Christine Blume at Switzerland â€™s University of Basel Center for Chronobiology , also found people were sleeping more . 
In this case , the participants who were based in Austria , Germany and Switzerland , were averaging around 13 more minutes of sleep per night . 
Blume suggests that people were working from home and able to get more work done during the day , leaving them more time to sleep . 
But Blume and her coauthors found that their respondents were experiencing a decrease in sleep quality . 
To help combat this , Blume suggested that people exercise more and make the most of natural light .
