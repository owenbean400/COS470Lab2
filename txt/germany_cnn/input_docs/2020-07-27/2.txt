Germany ’s center for disease prevention , the Robert Koch Institute , has called a general rise in Covid 19 infections in the country " very disturbing " and says it is " monitoring the situation very closely . " 
The spike comes as authorities in Bavaria are working to contain a large scale outbreak among seasonal workers on a vegetable farm in the town of Mamming . 
Authorities announced on Sunday that 174 laborers -- about a third of all seasonal workers on site -- had tested positive for the virus . 
At a press conference Sunday , Bavaria ’s health minister , Melanie Huml said that local authorities have placed the farm , which employed seasonal workers from Romania , Bulgaria , Hungary and Ukraine , on complete lockdown . 
The workers who tested positive had been separated from the rest of the laborers , and local police and a private security firm were monitoring the quarantine , Huml added . 
Farming " test offensive " : As part of a new " test offensive , " Huml also announced that workers in other agricultural companies in Bavaria will be tested . 
" The goal of the new test program is to prevent large outbreaks like the current one in Mamming . 
At the same time we want to increase the health protection of the workers there , " she added . 
Huml also announced that all of the around 3,300 residents of Mamming will be able to get voluntary coronavirus tests free of charge . 
The Robert Koch Institute said Saturday it recorded 815 and 781 infections on subsequent days at the end of last week . 
" Before , the number was considerably lower around 500 new cases per day , " the institute said in a press release . 
It blamed the rise mostly on a higher number of larger gatherings in Germany , but also on people returning from holidays abroad . 
The seven day reproductive rate in Germany is currently 1.16 , while the four day r rate is 1.22 , according to the Robert Koch Institute
