Britain 's health care system is experiencing " significant demand " for coronavirus testing from people who do not have symptoms , its health department said Monday , amid reports that its testing program has a backlog of 185,000 test swabs . 
" [ National Health Service ] Test and Trace is working and our capacity is the highest it has ever been but we are seeing a significant demand for tests including from people who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible , " a Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) spokesperson told CNN . 
According to the UK ’s Sunday Times newspaper , leaked DHSC documents indicate the government ’s testing program has been so overwhelmed that swabs have been sent to labs in Germany and Italy to help keep up with demand , as British labs have seen " chaos " in their supply chains . 
The DHSC spokesperson did not confirm or deny the specific details in the Sunday Times ’ report . 
" Our laboratories are processing more than a million tests a week and we recently announced new facilities and technology to process results even faster , " the spokesperson said in a statement . 
" New booking slots and home testing kits are made available daily for those who need them and we are targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most , including those where there is an outbreak , and prioritising at risk groups , " they added .
