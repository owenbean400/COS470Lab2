German authorities say a 26 year old US citizen has caused a spike in coronavirus infections in the town of Garmisch Partenkirchen . 
The unnamed woman had recently returned from a holiday abroad , according to Stephan Scharf , press officer of the District Administrator 's Office in the southern German town . 
Scharf told CNN he did not know which country she had returned from , but it had not been from the US . 
The woman developed Covid 19 symptoms , took a coronavirus test and was told to stay at home to wait for the results , said Scharf , but this did not stop her from going out and socializing . 
She has since received a positive test result and is in quarantine , said Scharf . 
" We do not know how many people the assumed spreader infected , although we know she was out being infectious , " Scharf said . 
On Friday there were 33 new cases in Garmisch Partenkirchen . 
" We did not have so many even during the height of Corona , " Scharf said . 
" This kind of behavior of course is everything but commendable . " 
Garmisch Partenkirchen recorded a seven day incidence rate of 55 cases per 100,000 inhabitants , according to the latest figures . 
German authorities have agreed to reimpose measures in areas where the incidence rate rises above 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants . 
As a result new regulations came into effect in Garmisch Partenkirchen over the weekend , meaning local pubs and bars have to close at 10 p.m . local time . 
Only five people can be at a table indoors , and 10 people outdoors -- half of what it was allowed before . 
The number of attendees allowed for parties have also been slashed from 200 to 100 , Scharf said . 
The woman works at the Edelweiss Lodge , a US Armed Forces Recreation Center Resort operated by the US Army , and Scharf told CNN 24 staff members had tested positive for coronavirus . 
The US Army Europe Public Affairs Department said in a statement Sunday that the resort would be closed for two weeks starting from Monday .
