Germany ’s coronavirus reproduction rate has increased to 0.9 according to the country 's centre for disease and control , the Robert Koch Institute , meaning every 10 people with the virus infect an average of nine others . 
That ’s up from a reproduction rate of 0.7 a week ago , according to the Institute ’s Vice President Lars Schaade . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has previously warned that if the number -- also known as the R0 value -- rises above 1 , the country ’s health system would eventually be overwhelmed . 
Yesterday she expressed concern that some German states were moving to ease coronavirus restrictions too soon , saying it could undermine the results that have been achieved . 
New cases slowing down : Germany now has 150,383 coronavirus cases and 5,321 related deaths , the Robert Koch Institute said on Friday . 
The country reported 2,337 new cases in the past 24 hours -- a slight slowdown , after three straight days of new infections accelerating .
