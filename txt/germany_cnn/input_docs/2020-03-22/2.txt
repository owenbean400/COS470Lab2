Germany has implemented a " contact ban " rather than a full nationwide lockdown in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus , says German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
Merkel said in a press conference Sunday that the country would toughen measures and " reduce contact with people as much as possible . " 
Merkel extrapolated on the ban in a phone conversation between herself and the 16 German state premiers on Sunday , saying a contact ban will be implemented , meaning no more than two people would be allowed to interact with each other â€” with the exceptions of families and people living together . 
Merkel said that " a minimum distance of 1.5 to 2 meters " should be adhered to and meetings in groups are now unacceptable and will be sanctioned if not adhered to . 
Further , Merkel added that restaurants , as well as hair salons , and tattoo shops will also be shut down . 
Merkel said these measures would be in place for at least two weeks .
