Germany suffered a major spike in Covid 19 related fatalities , with 952 deaths connected to the disease reported on Tuesday , according to figures released Wednesday by the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , the country ’s center for disease control . 
Tuesday ’s toll shatters the previous record of 598 deaths on December 11 . 
But the institute said a delay in reporting data from the large state of Saxony could be part of the reason for the sharp increase . 
Data was not transmitted from Saxony on Monday , so Wednesday ’s report includes missing numbers for Monday as well as Tuesday . 
The RKI also recorded 27,728 new cases of the novel Coronavirus Tuesday . 
Surging numbers : Germany is currently experiencing a major surge of infections , hospitalizations and deaths . 
The country entered into a hard national lockdown on Wednesday in an effort to bring the situation under control . 
An earlier version of this post misstated the gap in Saxony 's figures released on Wednesday . 
They included Monday as well as Tuesday .
