Germany 's largest airline Lufthansa has completed its first test flight where all passengers returned negative Covid 19 results using a rapid antigen test . 
The flight was from Munich to Hamburg , the airline said in a statement published Thursday . 
A second test flight is planned to take passengers from Hamburg to Munich . 
The rapid antigen tests do not detect the Covid 19 pathogen , but can detect proteins associated with it . 
Lufthansa said that customers receive their test results within 30 to 60 minutes of being tested . 
The airline said that only if the results are negative will a passenger 's boarding pass be activated and access to the gate granted . 
Passengers not wanting to be tested will be transferred to an alternative flight , the statement added .
