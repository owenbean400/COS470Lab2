The number of Covid 19 patients admitted to intensive care units in Germany has reached an all time high . 
3,186 Covid 19 patients are being treated in intensive care facilities - the highest number of patients in ICUs since the pandemic began , the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine ( DIVI ) said Thursday . 
Earlier this week , DIVI reported that cases had exceeded the levels seen during the initial coronavirus wave , confirming that German hospitals are filling up at high speed . 
The data also shows that 56 % of patients in ICUs currently need ventilation . 
When taking into account patients admitted to ICUs in Germany for other diseases , around 70 % of intensive care capacity facilities in the country are currently occupied . 
Despite this , 6,600 ICU beds are still vacant and Germany has a reserve of 12,300 beds it can deploy , including field hospital beds at the Berlin convention center . 
But health minister Jens Spahn on Thursday warned that ICUs could be overwhelmed if daily infection rates continue to rise at the current level . 
The head of Germany 's Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) warned earlier on Thursday that the overall number of infections remains " very high " and that he expects hospitals to reach capacity .
