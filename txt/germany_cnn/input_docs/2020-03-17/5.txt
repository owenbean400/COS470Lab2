Germany 's Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , the national agency for disease control and prevention , has raised the risk of the coronavirus to public health to " high . " 
" We notice that even well established clinics are now having problems , " said RKI president Lothar Wieler Tuesday . 
" We have to do everything possible to interrupt any possible chain of infection . " 
Wieler said he assumed the number of coronavirus cases is " significantly higher " than reported to the institute . 
" We do not yet know what the death rate will be , " he added . 
Wieler singled out the community of Heinsberg , North Rhine Westphalia , as being especially affected by the pandemic .
