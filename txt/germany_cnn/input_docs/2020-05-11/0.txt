Germany 's coronavirus reproduction rate is estimated to have risen over the crucial value of 1 , reaching 1.13 , according to the country 's disease and control center , the Robert Koch Institute . 
Prior to Saturday , Germany 's reproduction rate was below 1 , the institute reported . 
The reproduction rate refers to how many people each person infected with coronavirus will infect on average . 
The background : The increase in reproduction rate indicates a rise in infections across Germany , a few days after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced an easing of lockdown measures . 
On Wednesday last week , Merkel announced a gradual reopening of all shops and schools , as well as the resumption of the Bundesliga soccer league , although there will be no spectators . 
The Robert Koch Institute said there is still a " degree of uncertainty " with these estimates but the increase in reproduction rate " makes it necessary to observe the development very closely over the coming days . " 
Germany has reported more than 171,000 coronavirus cases , including over 7,500 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
