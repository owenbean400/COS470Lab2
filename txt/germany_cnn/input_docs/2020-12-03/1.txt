Germany 's coronavirus situation remains ' ' tense , ' ' the head of the country 's infectious disease agency , the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , warned Thursday . 
Lothar Wieler said despite Germany 's ' ' success in the last few weeks to stabilize infection numbers , " cases in the country " remain too high . " 
Wieler went on to say that Germany 's ' ' death toll is rising from week to week ' ' and ' ' in some regions , hospitals are on the brink . " 
Particularly worrying is the spread of coronavirus infections in care homes where , according to Wieler , many elderly patients over 80 are at risk . 
' ' We must protect the elderly , " he said , pointing to statistics that show ' ' every fifth person with Covid 19 in care homes is at risk of dying . ' ' The head of RKI 's surveillance unit , Ute Rexroth , warned that the virus is circulating at particularly high levels between the age group of 15 to 29 , and is being spread to the elderly generation . 
" The incident rate must be brought down , " he said . 
Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday said that ' ' the goal continues to be to get the incidence numbers below 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for seven days . " 
" We have a very high daily number of fatalities and this shows us once again just how big a responsibility we have to get the incidence rate below 50 again , " Merkel said . 
On Thursday , Germany recorded 22,046 new coronavirus infections , bringing the total tally to 1,106,789 , according to RKI data . 
The reported death toll rose by 479 to 17,602 .
