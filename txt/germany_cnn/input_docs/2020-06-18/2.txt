The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) has warned that the economic fallout from the pandemic may not be over for European airlines . 
IATA predicts a $ 23.1 billion loss for the European airline industry in 2020 , with passenger demand declining by half , putting up to 7 million jobs at risk in Europe alone . 
Air traffic remains much lower than last year and the recovery is going to be very slow despite a slight upturn since a low point in April , IATA said on Thursday . 
IATA repeated its calls for a coordinated response from European governments as countries begin to open their borders . 
The group also called for continued financial support for the industry . 
The association reiterated that quarantine measures were damaging for airlines , adding that 70 % of people in France , 76 % in Germany and 83 % in the UK will not travel if they remain in place , according to a survey .
