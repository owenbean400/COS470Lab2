The German leader also warned that the union needs to work together to keep EU member states from drifting apart . 
Merkel added that the situation has also exacerbated differences in EU member states ’ economies and budgets . 
EU leaders are debating a proposal for a 750 billion euro aid package designed to help the 27 member states to recover from the coronavirus pandemic . 
European finance ministers have previously struggled to agree a response to the economic impact of Covid 19 .
