A survey of small enterprises in China found that only 30 % have resumed business , Shu Chaohui of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said at a news conference on Tuesday . 
The survey applied to businesses in several industries with 100 employees or fewer . 
Shu called the situation " grim , " and said that the smaller the business , the lower the resumption rate was . 
" We have launched taxation and social insurance policies to support these enterprises , " Shu said . 
Fan Zhenyu of China 's Ministry of Transport said that 27 provinces have resume inter provincial buses to transport people back to work . 
More than 100 cities have already resumed public transportation within epidemic guidelines and have reduced the number of health check points from 17,000 to 9,000 , Fan reported . 
Global economic damage : Factory closures in China , as well as reduced demand for goods and services , were already expected to slam China 's economic growth in the first quarter , weigh on trade and rattle global markets . 
But the spread of the virus further afield increases the risk of substantial damage to economies that were growing at a much slower place than China , or -- as in the cases of Germany , Italy and Japan -- already at risk of recession .
