There have also been 16 new coronavirus related deaths , bringing the total to 47 , according to Saturday 's update . 
Officials are debating how best to respond to the continued spread of the virus . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s spokesman announced Friday that the government would re evaluate its coronavirus containment measures , but dodged the question of if -- and when -- curfews should be imposed . 
It comes as the state of Bavaria declared Friday it is imposing -- from midnight local time -- state wide exit restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus . 
The Bavarian State Premier Markus Soeder announced the measures will be in place for two weeks . 
Several German state premiers and local communities have raised concerns about the rate of the virus ’s spread across Germany -- and have called for a nationwide lockdown . 
However , Germany is a federal state and decisions cannot be implemented nationwide by the Chancellor -- only in collaboration with state premiers .
