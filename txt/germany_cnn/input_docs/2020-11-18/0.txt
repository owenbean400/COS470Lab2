Officers are using water cannon and pepper spray as they try to disperse a protest against coronavirus restrictions in the German capital , Berlin police said Wednesday . 
The demonstration is taking place near the Brandenburg Gate , a few hundred meters away from Germany 's parliament , the Reichstag , which has temporarily locked its doors . 
Officers at the demonstration have been targeted with " bottles , stones and firecrackers as well as with pepper spray . 
In turn , they are using physical coercion and pepper spray and have arrested some of the attackers , " a tweet from the Berlin police said . 
A previous tweet said that because the protesters " did not fulfil the obligation to leave the location , people were just rained on by our water cannons . " 
Television pictures showed a tense standoff between police officers and demonstrators . 
Police have been trying to slowly move the demonstrators away from the parliament after tweeting the demonstration was being dissolved . 
Parliament is in session and there is a debate going on in the main plenary hall . 
Berlin police spokesman Stefan Petersen earlier told CNN that several thousand protesters had gathered near the parliamentary district in central Berlin . 
The organizers for several demonstrations asked for permission to demonstrate in the no protest zone around the German parliament , and that permission was not granted , Petersen said . 
TV footage showed many demonstrators without masks and not socially distanced . 
Some protesters were carrying flags for the right wing populist Alternative for Germany ( Af D ) political party , and at least one imperial banner -- a flag now deployed by the far right as the swastika is prohibited in Germany -- could be seen . 
The Berlin police force tweeted that requests to wear a mask had not had any effect . 
Around 2,200 police officers will be deployed overall Wednesday , Petersen said .
