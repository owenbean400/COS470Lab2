Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Soeder says current coronavirus restrictions are not enough to contain a rise in case numbers in the southern German state . 
Germany is currently under a nationwide partial lockdown which prevents restaurants , bars and leisure facilities from opening . 
Limits have also been imposed on private gatherings , which are capped at five people from two households . 
Soeder said on Monday that even stricter lockdown measures would be imposed across Bavaria from December 9 . 
He said the current measures , though a partial success , had not done enough to contain the latest spread of infection . 
The Bavarian PM said he was bringing in the rules on the basis that every federal state which has been hit hard must also take special measures . 
Bavaria 's health ministry says that as of Sunday , 229,868 people in the state have been infected , with 4,291 coronavirus fatalities . 
Bavaria is Germany 's largest federal state , with a population of around 13 million people .
