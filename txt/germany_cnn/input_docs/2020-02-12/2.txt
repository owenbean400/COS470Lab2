The spread of novel coronavirus will get worse before it gets better , German health minister Jens Spahn warned at a press conference Wednesday . 
" The tipping point has not yet been reached â€“ neither in China , internationally nor in Germany , " Spahn said . 
He added that the G7 group will hold another conference call Wednesday to coordinate their response to the spread of novel coronavirus . 
The group -- which includes the US , Germany , France , Italy , Japan , Canada and Britain -- previously met in early February to discuss coordinating travel regulations and precautions as well as medical research and cooperation with the World Health Organization , the European Union and China .
