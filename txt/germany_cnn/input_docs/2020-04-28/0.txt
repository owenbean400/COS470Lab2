Germany ’s coronavirus reproduction rate has increased to 1 , coming closer to a threshold that Chancellor Angela Merkel has previously warned it must stay under in order for the country to continue pushing the disease back . 
On average , one person infected with Covid 19 is now infecting one other person , according to the country 's center for disease control and prevention , the Robert Koch Institute . 
That ’s up from a reproduction rate of 0.9 a week ago and 0.7 the week before . 
Merkel has previously warned that if the number -- also known as the R0 value -- rises above 1 , the country ’s health system would eventually be overwhelmed . 
She has also said that Germany risks squandering the gains made so far if it loosens physical distancing restrictions too quickly . 
Despite the rise in the reproduction number , new infections remain at a relatively moderate level . 
The institute reported 1,144 new infections in the past 24 hours , while 163 people died of coronavirus related symptoms . 
Germany 's death toll now stands at 5,913 .
