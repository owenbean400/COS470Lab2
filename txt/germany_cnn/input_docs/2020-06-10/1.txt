Germany will lift its border controls with neighbors France , Austria , Switzerland and Denmark on June 15 , German interior minister Horst Seehofer said today . 
New arrivals from Italy will also no longer have to go through border controls , though the two countries do not share a physical border . 
The controls will be relaxed for travelers arriving from Spain by plane starting on June 21 , Seehofer added . 
The easing of restrictions comes as the country slowly rolls back its strictest lockdown measures .
