Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , is confident about the two potential Covid 19 vaccine candidates that could be ready for use by next month . 
" I 've seen the numbers . 
They 're going to hold , " Fauci told CNN ’s Chris Cuomo on Thursday . 
Both Pfizer and Moderna ’s coronavirus vaccines showed a 95 % efficacy rate in clinical trials . 
Vaccine maker Pfizer has reported the results from its Phase 3 trial and its partner , Germany ’s Bio NTech , said the companies will file for Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization on Friday . 
Fauci said it was clear that the vaccine " prevents severe disease and it prevents symptomatic disease . 
Whether or not it prevents infection we 're going to find out . " 
But he said both did well enough . 
" I 'll take a vaccine that prevents people from getting seriously ill any day of the year , " he said .
