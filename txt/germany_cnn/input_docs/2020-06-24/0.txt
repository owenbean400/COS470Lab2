All citizens living in Guetersloh , the German district at the center of a new coronavirus outbreak , can be tested for Covid 19 by their general medical practitioners , said local officials . 
A cluster in the Toennies meat processing plant in the area has caused Germany 's coronavirus reproduction rate to rise sharply . 
On Tuesday North Rhine Westphalia state Prime Minister Armin Laschet said the entire district -- home to more than 360,000 people -- would be locked down for the next seven days . 
Laschet said the new measures were necessary because 1,553 workers at the Toennies factory have tested positive for the virus in recent days . 
From Wednesday people living in Guetersloh can be tested for coronavirus by their medical general practitioner , even if they do not have symptoms . 
The tests were previously conducted by diagnostics centres .
