Lufthansa suffered 2.1 billion euros ( $ 2.35 billion ) worth of losses in the first quarter of 2020 , the German airline group said in a statement on Wednesday . 
The airline blamed the global pandemic for most of the damage and said cost cutting measures implemented so far -- like moth balling jets and putting large parts of staff on Germany â€™s labor protection program -- were only able to partially offset the revenue decline . 
Lufthansa recently secured a German government bailout of nearly $ 10 billion to help the carrier through the crisis .
