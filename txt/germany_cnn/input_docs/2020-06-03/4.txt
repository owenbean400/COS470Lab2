European rail operator Thalys is to gradually resume its international train services between the Netherlands , Belgium , France and Germany starting next week . 
Thalys , which normally carries 7.5 million passengers a year to 26 destinations has been running four trains a day between Brussels , Amsterdam and Paris since March 10 . 
Beginning on June 9 , the operator will restart a daily service between Dortmond and Paris and increase other services to 20 % of its normal offering by the middle of July , with the hope of running 50 % of its trains by August . 
In an email to customers , Thayls CEO Bertrand Gosselin said : " We do not know when the Covid 19 pandemic will end , nor when our lives will regain some normality . " 
Gosselin also assured passengers , " that the safety , well being and health of our clients and employees is at all times at the core of our decisions . " 
Passengers will be required to wear a face covering at all times while onboard and the number of seats available on Thalys trains has been halved to maintain social distancing . 
Since April 8 , anyone traveling to and from France is required to complete an International Travel Certificate to Mainland France form , confirming their journey is necessary and they are free of Covid 19 symptoms . 
Other international European rail operators Deutsche Bahn , SNCF and NS — who have also been running a limited service or no service at all — have begun to slowly resume services from 1 June . 
Eurostar , which runs trains between mainland Europe and the United Kingdom will continue to run a reduced service . 
A spokesperson for Eurostar told CNN , " We continue to closely monitor the situation as it develops , and we hope to gradually increase our number of services and destinations over the coming weeks in line with the easing of lockdown restrictions . "
