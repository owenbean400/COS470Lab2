That 's a dramatic jump from the 357 cases reported just the day before . 
It brings the national total to 170,508 cases , the institute said . 
The coronavirus reproduction rate in Germany has been above 1 for the past three consecutive days , the institute said . 
A rate of 1 means that on average , each infected person is infecting one other person .

The institute said it 's too early to tell whether the virus is on the rise again due to statistical uncertainties .
