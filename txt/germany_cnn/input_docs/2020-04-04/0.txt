Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that there is a " bit of hope " for Germany after figures show that the spread of coronavirus is " a bit slower than it was just a few days ago . " Speaking on video published on the German federal government 's You Tube channel , the Chancellor did stress however , that it was " way too early to recognize a definite trend " and " it is far too early to loosen the strict rules . " 
Merkel , herself now out of isolation , said it would be " absolutely irresponsible " to fix a date for the restrictions to be lifted and warned that Germany would " go from the frying pan into the fire – medically , economically and socially . " 
Merkel also urged all Germans to avoid traveling around the country during the upcoming Easter period .
