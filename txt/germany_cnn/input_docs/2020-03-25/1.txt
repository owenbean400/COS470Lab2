The President of Germany 's Robert Koch Institute , the national agency for disease control and prevention , has warned that the coronavirus epidemic is just starting in the country . 
" We are at the beginning of the epidemic and the number is growing , " Lothar Wieler said . 
Addressing the comparatively low death rate in Germany , Wieler said " We do not know why this is the case but there are several factors playing into it . " 
There was widespread testing in Germany and many mildly ill people were detected , he said . 
And there has not been a large number of old people who have fallen sick so far . 
But Wieler warned that it is completely " open ended how this epidemic will develop , " and added that the death death toll will rise in Germany .
