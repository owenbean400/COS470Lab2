German Covid 19 infections are still " too high , " the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases ( RKI ) said on Thursday . 
Lothar Wieler said Germany " cannot afford to have higher Covid 19 numbers " and that while the numbers has stabilized , the country has not yet " turned a corner . " 
Wieler , however , did add that he was " optimistic that the positive trend of Covid 19 cases would continue . " 
The news was not all so positive , with some grisly figures coming out of Germany . 
Ute Rexroth , head of RKI 's surveillance unit , added that while the new restrictions were working , Covid 19 deaths and patients in ICU were rising . 
The number of people in ICU 's was at an all time high of 3,561 and cautioned that Germany could see " 1,000 deaths " a day . 
According to RKI data , Germany recorded 22,609 new coronavirus cases with 251 more deaths .
