Germany currently has the capacity to carry out coronavirus tests on all travelers returning to the country from abroad , Teresa Nauber , a spokesperson for the health ministry , said Wednesday . 
Germany ’s health minister , Jens Spahn , has said all travelers returning to Germany from what the government deems to be " high risk areas " will have to take mandatory PCR tests for the novel coronavirus starting next week . 
According to the health ministry , the tests are to be offered free of charge to travelers and paid for by the federal government , with further plans in place to also offer free testing to travelers returning from non high risk countries , including member states of the European Union . 
The health ministry 's spokesperson added that the government plans to have the regulation for free tests ready before the end of this week . 
Mandatory testing is set to begin in Germany next week . 
The move comes after Germany ’s center for disease prevention , the Robert Koch Institute , voiced grave concern about a rise in coronavirus infections in the country , which its scientists say are due in part to infected travelers returning to Germany .
