Germany 's labs have increased their coronavirus testing capacity to 141,815 PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) tests a day , according to the Robert Koch Institute , the national center for disease control . 
That means the nation 's labs can conduct 860,494 tests a week , said RKI . 
This estimate factors in that not all labs work seven days a week . 
It 's a twofold increase : last week , German labs only tested 467,137 tests . 
Aggressive testing ahead of reopening : Germany has said that extensive testing is a key factor in its strategy to combat Covid 19 and for loosening some of the restrictions that have been placed on public life .
