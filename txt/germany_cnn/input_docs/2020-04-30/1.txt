It â€™s " probable " that the UK wo not meet its target of conducting 100,000 tests per day by today , said the country 's Justice Secretary Robert Buckland . 
Early in April , the UK government set itself the target of carrying out 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by the end of the month . 
To put that in perspective , Germany is currently at a testing capacity of 141,815 tests per day .
