Germany is conducting more coronavirus tests than at any time since the outbreak of the virus , its government disease control agency said on Thursday . 
All eyes on the reproduction rate : Germany 's coronavirus reproduction rate currently stands at 0.76 on average , Wieler added . 
A reproduction rate of one means each person with coronavirus will infect an average of one other person . 
Last week the RKI said that the reproduction number is an indicator authorities are watching out for when deciding on loosening coronavirus restrictions for the public . 
Public health experts say that a number of one or above would make it impossible to loosen restrictions . 
Loosened restrictions and mandatory masks : Public life changed considerably for most Germans on Monday as the wearing of masks became mandatory in many public spaces across the country . 
From last week , Germany loosened many of the restrictions on public life that were designed to halt the spread of coronavirus . 
Small shops , car dealers and bicycle stores were allowed to reopen . 
But Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Germany risks squandering the gains it had made in beating back Covid 19 . 
She said she fully supported the measures to loosen restrictions , " but their implementation worries me . 
Partially , they appear to be very bold , maybe too bold . "
