The US led international coalition in Afghanistan has implemented a series of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus , including " temporarily " pausing the movement of personnel movement into Afghanistan and delaying the return of some service members . 
" As of March 19 , 21 Resolute Support personnel exhibiting flu like symptoms are in isolation and receiving medical care , " the statement said , referring to the official name of the international coalition operation . 
The statement said that because there are no testing facilities in Afghanistan , tests are being performed at a military hospital in Landstuhl , Germany , or at other civilian locations . 
Additionally " 1,500 multi national service members , civilians and contractors who have arrived in theater within the past week are living in screening facilities prior to onward movement . " 
Miller said that this was due to an " Abundance of caution , not because they are sick . " 
He also said that access to bases had been restricted and that while efforts to train and advise local Afghan forces continue there has been a push to conduct meetings via " technical means " as opposed to in person .
