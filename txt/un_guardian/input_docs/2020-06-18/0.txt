The UK will deploy royal influence in a bid to garner international support for its proposals to support survivors of conflict related sexual violence in the wake of the global coronavirus outbreak . 
The Countess of Wessex , alongside human rights minister Lord Ahmad , will present the draft Murad Code at a virtual United Nations event on Friday . 
Sophie ’s involvement is part of her work with the Foreign Office on tackling war related sexual violence , something she has undertaken since March 2019 . 
The Murad Code , created alongside Nobel Laureate Nadia Murad , is designed to strengthen justice for survivors around the world and recognise the difficulties in accessing support during the Covid 19 crisis . 
Lord Ahmad , the UK prime minister ’s special representative on preventing sexual violence in conflict , will urge UN members to collaborate on the Murad Code in a bid to build international consensus in eradicating rape and other forms of sexual violence as weapons of war . 
He will also push for countries to do more to listen to survivors on what support should be put in place to aid recovery Lord Ahmad is expected to say at the UN meeting : " We are determined to tackle these abhorrent crimes . 
" Covid 19 is an unprecedented threat to how we respond to these crimes . 
The impacts of this pandemic are stark . 
" Crucial medical and psychological services are at risk , as governments divert resources towards their response . 
" Restrictions on movement limit physical routes for survivors to report crimes , or to move to safety . 
" And stay at home measures mean those in abusive situations are even more vulnerable to violence . "
