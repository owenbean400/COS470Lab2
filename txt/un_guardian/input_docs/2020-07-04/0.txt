The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said on Saturday that it was discontinuing its trials of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and combination HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalised patients with Covid 19 after they failed to reduce mortality . 
" These interim trial results show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir produce little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalised Covid 19 patients when compared to standard of care . 
" Solidarity trial investigators will interrupt the trials with immediate effect , " the WHO said in a statement , referring to large multi country trials that the agency is leading . 
The UN agency said that the decision , taken on the recommendation of the trial ’s international steering committee , does not affect other studies where the drugs are used for non hospitalised patients or as a prophylaxis . 
Another arm of the WHO led trial is looking at the potential effect of Gilead ’s antiviral drug remdesivir on Covid 19 .
