The Green Climate Fund ( GCF ) has promised developing nations it will ramp up efforts to help them tackle climate challenges as they strive to recover from the coronavirus pandemic , approving $ 879m in backing for 15 new projects around the world . 
At a four day virtual board meeting ending late Friday , the fund added Afghanistan and Sudan to a list of more than 100 countries receiving a total of $ 6.2bn to reduce planet heating emissions and enhance climate resilience . 
The GCF was set up under UN climate talks in 2010 to help developing nations tackle global warming , and started allocating money in 2015 . 
Executive director Yannick Glemarec said the fund had " a key role to play to maintain climate ambition in the era of Covid 19 " and would aim to improve the speed and efficiency of its response to developing country needs . 
Board co chair Nauman Bashir Bhatti , from Pakistan , said climate finance would be crucial for recovery from the pandemic and the fund needed to increase support " even during these difficult times " . 
Those promises came as small island states criticised the pace and size of GCF assistance , saying they were now struggling with the economic blow from the pandemic on top of climate change impacts such as rising seas and stronger storms . 
Fiji â€™s UN ambassador Satyendra Prasad said Covid 19 risked worsening the already high debt burden of small island nations , as tourism dived . 
" The importance of the [ GCF ] ... in accelerating transformative climate action in this present decade cannot be understated , " he added . 
He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation island nations were struggling to access other sources of finance and urged the GCF to boost aid to help them prepare project proposals and to release funding for approved projects faster . 
The Alliance of Small Island States said its members represented less than 10 % of total funding requests .
