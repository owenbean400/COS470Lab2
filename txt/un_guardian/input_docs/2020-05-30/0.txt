Liberian president George Weah , a former international football legend , has released a song to be used by the UN to spread awareness about the new coronavirus , his office said Saturday , according to Agence France Presse . 
Weah hopes to appeal to music lovers across the West African nation of some 4.5 million people to ensure Covid 19 does not spread further . 
It is not the first time Weah has used his singing skills . 
During the 2014 Ebola crisis , when he was a senator , he released an awareness song . 
" The song , Let ’s Stand Together to Fight Corona , will be a part of the second phase of UNESCO ’s Dont Go Viral campaign , which they say is aimed at informing and sensitising communities across Africa about the dangers of the disease , " Weah ’s office said .
