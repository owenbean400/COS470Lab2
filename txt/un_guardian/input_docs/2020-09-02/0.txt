The Trump administration is planning to cut its membership dues to the World Health Organization , in a legally controversial move that will be challenged by Congress . 
The US issued its formal notice of withdrawal from the WHO in July , after Donald Trump accused the body of being pro China and of failing to contain the coronavirus pandemic . 
However , the withdrawal does not take effect until next July , and until then – according to a 72 year old agreement with Congress – the US is obliged to maintain its financial contributions . 
By the time of the withdrawal notice , the first tranche of $ 58m of its " assessed contributions " – national membership dues – had already been paid , leaving a second tranche of $ 65m due this month . 
That will now be diverted , according to a state department briefing to Congress . 
The notes said " the US is reprogramming the balance of its planned Fiscal Year 2020 assessed WHO contributions to partially pay an assessment to the UN , earlier than it would have otherwise " .
