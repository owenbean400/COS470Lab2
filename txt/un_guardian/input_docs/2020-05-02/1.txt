Boris Johnson has said that doctors were considering intubating him while he was in intensive care with coronavirus . 
The prime minister told the Sun On Sunday : It was a tough old moment , I wo not deny it . 
They had a strategy to deal with a ‘ death of Stalin’-type scenario . 
I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place . 
The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong . 
They gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie . 
Johnson told the paper " the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction " and that he kept asking himself : " How am I going to get out of this ? " 
He said : It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent . 
I remember feeling frustrated . 
I could not understand why I was not getting better . 
But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe . 
That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally . 
Johnson said he was " in denial " initially about how serious his illness was , and that doctors were right to " force " him to go to St Thomas ’s where he spent three nights in intensive care . 
Here is our inside story of his illness from a fortnight ago .
