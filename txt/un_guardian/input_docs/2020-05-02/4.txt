You Tube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke ’s account . 
The video sharing site said the 68 year old former footballer violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus . 
The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms , including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network . 
The video service , owned by Google , told the BBC : You Tube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid 19 as described by the WHO and the NHS . 
Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke ’s You Tube channel . 
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook , who removed Icke ’s page from their site on Friday . 
The Centre for Countering Digital Hate ( CCDH ) claimed Icke ’s conspiracies over Covid 19 have been viewed more than 30m times and welcomed the move . 
CCDH ’s chief executive Imran Ahmed said : We commend You Tube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke ’s channel . 
However , there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers , who promote Mr Icke ’s content ( and ) need to be removed . 
It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and You Tube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms . 
Lies cost lives in a global pandemic , and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk . 
In 48 hours both Facebook and You Tube have deleted David Icke after our report on his toxic COVID 19 misinformation . 
Now we need @ Instagram and @ Twitter to follow suit.800 people have signed our # Deplatform Icke open letter . 
Add your name here : Icke , the self described ground breaking author and public speaker , tweeted : " You Tube delete David Icke - the man the Elite are terrified of - after complaint from CCDH . 
The reason is made up . 
Where are you gutless media ? 
Silent or cheering . "
