More than 200 UN employees have been infected with Covid 19 in Syria , medical workers and UN officials have said . 
UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria , Imran Riza , last week told UN heads of agencies that the global body was close to securing a medical facility for treatment of coronavirus cases . 
" More than two hundred cases have been reported among UN staff members , some of whom have been hospitalised and three who were medically evacuated , " the official in Syria wrote in a letter , which was leaked to Reuters from an infected local staff member . 
Humanitarian workers and medics said the actual number is " considerably higher " , including the hundreds of staff members working for NGO partners reporting to the several UN agencies in the country . 
Riza said there had been a ten fold spike in infections in Syria in the two months since he last briefed staff , referring to health ministry figures that say there have been 3,171 cases and 134 deaths since the first case was reported on 23 March .
