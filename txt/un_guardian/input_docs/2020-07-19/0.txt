The United Nations has made an urgent appeal for $ 283m ( £ 225m ) to help Sudan tackle the coronavirus pandemic and its economic consequences , as millions in the country face hunger . 
" Covid 19 arrived in Sudan at a time when an increasing part of the population was already struggling to meet their basic needs and the health system was already under extreme stress , " said the UN ’s Sudan humanitarian coordinator , Gwi Yeop Son . 
She said the pandemic had worsened an economic crisis , hitting purchasing power , while movement restrictions had restricted people ’s access to food , healthcare and basic services . 
" Unless we act now , we should be prepared for a series of human tragedies , " she said . 
Sudan has officially registered more than 10,000 cases of Covid 19 and around 650 deaths , pushing authorities to reimpose a lockdown on Khartoum state , including the capital , that was loosened earlier this month . 
That came on top of acute economic woes that have seen people queuing for hours to buy essential foods and fuel . 
Inflation topped 114 % in May . Protests sparked by the previous government ’s abrupt tripling of bread prices in late 2018 prompted the army to oust longtime dictator Omar Al Bashir . 
Tinago Chikoto , the UN humanitarian coordination office ’s deputy chief for Sudan , said more than 9.6 million people , almost a quarter of the entire population , " are facing severe hunger , the highest figure ever recorded in Sudan " .
