The Australian prime minister , Scott Morrison , is standing firm on his calls for the independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and urged all nations to share a vaccine once it is proven . 
Morrison ’s pre recorded speech on the virtual stage on Saturday morning to the 75th United Nations general assembly , praised the World Health Organization for establishing an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus , AAP reports . 
" There is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the Covid 19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans , " he said . 
" This virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples . 
We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again . " 
The inquiry resolution backed by 145 countries in May does not mention China , instead committing to an impartial , independent and comprehensive evaluation . 
China eventually supported the European Union motion . 
Ties between the two nations have since been fraught , with tariffs being imposed on some goods and Australian journalists being evacuated from China . 
Morrison urged other leaders to share a coronavirus vaccine if they discover one . 
He has previously said if Australia found a vaccine , it would be shared across the world . 
" This is a global responsibility and it ’s a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide , " he said . 
" Some might see short term advantage or even profit . 
But I assure you to anyone who may think along those lines , humanity will have a very long memory and be a very , very severe judge . "
