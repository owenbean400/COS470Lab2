Spain and Germany were among the countries tightening restrictions on Tuesday in a bid to cool coronavirus hotspots that have sparked fears of a second wave . 
The World Health Organization warned that the virus did not appear to be affected by seasonality , as the global death toll from the pandemic passed 654,000 – nearly a third of the dead in Europe , according to an AFP tally . 
More than 100,000 deaths have been recorded since 9 July and the global toll has doubled in just over two months . 
The UN ’s World Tourism Organization said the sector lost $ 320bn in revenue globally during the first five months of 2020 , threatening millions of livelihoods . 
This is " more than three times the loss during the global financial crisis of 2009 " , the Madrid based body said in a statement . 
The International Air Transport Association meanwhile warned that global air traffic would not return to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic until at least 2024 . 
Spain , one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic , insisted it was still a safe destination for tourists despite tackling 361 active outbreaks and more than 4,000 new cases . 
Several countries have nonetheless imposed quarantines on people returning from Spain , including its biggest tourist market , Britain . 
The strict lockdown in Spain destroyed more than a million jobs during the second quarter of the year , the National Statistics Institute ( INE ) reported on Tuesday - mainly in tourism .
