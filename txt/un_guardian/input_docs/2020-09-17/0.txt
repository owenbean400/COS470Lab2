Here ’s a summary of recent events : • France identified Lyon and Nice as virus " red zones " , where additional measures would be needed to control the spread of Covid 19 . 
Later Reuters reported the French government would not be joining WHO ’s international vaccine programme , a blow to the UN body ’s effort to discourage " vaccine nationalism " . 
• Canada could lose its ability to manage the coronavirus pandemic owing to a worrying recent surge in Covid 19 cases , the country ’s top medical officer has said . 
The warning from the chief public health officer , Theresa Tam , is the clearest indication yet of how worried authorities in the country are about the potential for the outbreak to spiral out of control . 
• Facebook said it would no longer show health groups in its recommendations to ensure users get health information from authoritative sources . 
It said the move reflected its view that such sources of information were " crucial " . 
• In the US , New York City once again delayed the return of most of the million plus students in its public schools . 
The mayor , Bill de Blasio , said most elementary school students would do remote only learning until 29 September . 
• Wuhan , ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak , has reopened for international flights , ending an eight month moratorium since the disease first emerged . 
China stopped international flights in March as global alarm increased about the spread of Covid 19 , but has now largely brought the disease under control . 
• The World Health Organization warned of " alarming rates of transmission " of Covid 19 across Europe and cautioned countries against shortening quarantine periods . 
The body said the number of coronavirus cases in September " should serve as a wake up call for all of us " . 
That ’s all from me . 
Lucy Campbell will pick up the baton shortly .
