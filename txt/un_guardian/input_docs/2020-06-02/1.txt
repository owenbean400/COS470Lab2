Yemen remains on the brink of " a macabre tragedy " , the UN has warned after a humanitarian fundraising summit raised only $ 1.35bn ( £ 1.05bn ) for this year , around $ 1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year . 
The UN ’s humanitarian chief , Mark Lowcock , said unless more money was raised Yemen " will face a horrific outcome at the end of the year " . 
Despite the shortfall " the UN will not abandon the people of Yemen " , he said , adding that pledging would continue because some of last year ’s large donors had not yet contributed . 
Dr Abdullah al Rabiah , the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia , which co hosted the virtual summit , put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen ’s five year civil war . 
" We want to be sure that the money will go to those in need , " he said .
