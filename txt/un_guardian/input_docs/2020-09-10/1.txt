The United Nations on Thursday called for an immediate " quantum leap " in funding for global programmes to combat the coronavirus and restore prosperity . 
The UN secretary general , Antonio Guterres , urged countries to find $ 15bn over the next three months to fund the ACT Accelerator programme , a global collaboration to hunt for a vaccine and treatments led by the UN ’s World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
" Either we stand together or we will be doomed , " Guterres told a virtual meeting of the ACT Accelerator , calling the virus the " number one global security threat " . 
" We need a quantum leap in funding to increase the chances of a global solution to get the world moving , working and prospering again , " he said . 
He said the near $ 3bn contributed so far had been critical for the initial phase since the accelerator ’s launch four months ago , but $ 35bn more was needed to shift from start up to scale up - beginning with $ 15bn in the next three months . 
Without it " we will lose the window of opportunity " , Guterres said .
