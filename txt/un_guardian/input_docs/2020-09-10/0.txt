The United Nations has called for an immediate " quantum leap " in funding for global programmes developing coronavirus treatments and vaccine candidates . 
The UN secretary general , Antonio Guterres , urged countries to find $ 15bn over the next three months to fund the ACT Accelerator programme , a global scheme led by the World Health Organization . 
" Either we stand together or we will be doomed , " Guterres told an ACT Accelerator virtual meeting , describing the virus as the " number one global security threat " . 
" We need a quantum leap in funding to increase the chances of a global solution to get the world moving , working and prospering again , " he said . 
Nearly $ 3bn has been contributed to the scheme so far , for the programme â€™s initial phase , which was launched four months ago . $ 35bn will be needed to scale the programme up , Guterres said .
