South Korea has identified 17 more coronavirus patients linked to a nightclub cluster in Seoul , Vice Health Minister Kim Gang lip said today . 
Last weekend , authorities in the capital shut down all nightclubs and bars after a spike in cases was connected to the clubbing district Itaewon . 
There are now a total of 148 cases in the nightclub cluster . 
Authorities raced to track down people who may have been in the area during the incubation period , using cell phone data and credit card records . 
They have tested tens of thousands of people in the past week alone . 
The country has now recorded 11,018 coronavirus cases and 260 deaths , according to Kim and data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Church alert : Authorities feared the outbreak of another possible cluster in the city of Incheon , where two infected people attended church services along with 1,000 others . 
However , a fresh crisis appears to have been avoided -- except for five people whose results are pending , all members of the congregation have tested negative . 
Kim said it was likely because 300 of the 1,000 church attendees had been watching the service online , and the remaining 700 people who physically attended had worn masks and gloves and sat apart from each other .
