So far , about 46,000 tests have been conducted in relation to the cluster in the Itaewon district , KCDC Director Jung Eun kyeong said Friday . 
An estimated 5,500 people visited the five affected nightclubs and around 4,300 of those have been tested . 
Some of the clubs are frequented by members of South Korea 's gay community , a detail which has led to an outpouring of hate speech towards the country 's already embattled LGBTQ population .
