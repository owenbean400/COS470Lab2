A high school student who has no history of traveling to infected areas has been diagnosed with coronavirus , according to Washington State Department of Health . 
The student is one of two new presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in the state of Washington . 
The second presumptive case is a female in her 50 's from Snohomish County who recently traveled to South Korea . 
Presumptively positive means the tests have come back positive from the public health laboratory in Washington and are pending confirmation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The boy -- who is a high school student in Washington state -- visited two different clinics in Snohomish County this week , according to Snohomish Health District interim health officer Dr . Chris Spitters . 
The student planned to go to school on Friday morning , but was notified of his test results and returned home before attending any classes . 
The boy 's school , Jackson High School , will be closed on Monday for three days to allow for deep cleaning . 
The student who tested positive is currently in home isolation and doing well . 
A small number of students that came into close contact with the student were notified by local health officials , and will stay home for the next 14 days . 
Health officials are also working to notify any health care workers and patients that may have come into contact with the student . 
The boy 's sibling , who attends Gateway Middle School , is being tested and will remain out of school in quarantine until his test results are back , according to a letter to families from Everett Public Schools , which runs Jackson High School . 
According to the letter , the sibling is not currently symptomatic .
