South Korea registered 34 new coronavirus cases on Saturday , its biggest single day jump in infections since April 9 , according to the country â€™s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) . 
The spike in cases is believed to be linked to Seoul 's nightclub scene -- specifically to a 29 year old man who tested positive for the virus on Thursday , after visiting three night clubs in Seoul on May 2 . 
Until recently South Korea had almost completely contained its epidemic , with new cases being reported in single digits in the days before the new cluster emerged . 
As of Sunday noon , 54 cases had been linked to the nightclub cluster , 43 of whom had visited the night spots in question , while 11 were people who came into contact with those who had been there . 
Officials said at least 1,946 people who had visited the establishments in question were being tracked down and put into self isolation , the mayor Park Won soon said . 
On Sunday , President Moon Jae in warned of a second wave of the epidemic during his televised speech to mark the third anniversary of his inauguration . 
South Korea has recorded 10,874 cases of the virus , and 9,610 people have recovered , according to KCDC .
