More than a quarter of young adults infected with coronavirus have developed pneumonia , a study by South Korean researchers has found . 
Their study of 315 patients aged 18 to 39 at six hospitals in February and March found 26 % of them had pneumonia . 
In South Korea , everyone who tested positive for coronavirus , even those with no symptoms , were hospitalized early in the pandemic . 
Of the patients with pneumonia , 23 % still had abnormal chest x rays 10 days after their first diagnosis , the researchers said . 
And one patient who did not have symptoms at first later developed pneumonia . 
While young adults are less likely than older people to develop severe coronavirus symptoms , the researchers said their findings show the infection can be serious even in healthy young adults .
