South Korean authorities have identified another 12 locally transmitted infections of Covid 19 linked to nightclubs in the capital Seoul . 
Authorities are particularly worried that the virus was widely transmitted when people started returning to the bars and clubs of the Itaewon nightlife district from the end of April . 
A total of 131 positive cases have emerged in this cluster since May 6 , according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) . 
The KCDC has conducted 35,000 tests -- 15,000 alone on Wednesday -- in an attempt to quickly trace and contain this outbreak . 
Anonymous testing : The government is urging citizens who visited the area from April 24 through May 6 to get tested and is allowing people to remain anonymous . 
Some of the clubs where the virus spread are frequented by members of South Korea 's LGBT community , which sparked a backlash against gay people in local media and lead some to fear they would be outed . 
The government of the local city of Incheon , which borders Seoul , said that 14 of the 131 cases are linked to one private academy instructor who visited clubs in Itaewon . 
The patient initially hid his movement but his GPS location tracking revealed his place of work in Incheon , a city bordering Seoul . 
Vice Health Minister Kim Gang lip said earlier that Incheon city announced it would pursue legal action against the tutor and if found guilty , he could be punished with up to two years in prison . 
A total of 10,991 infections and 260 deaths have now been reported in the country , according to the Johns Hopkins University tally .
