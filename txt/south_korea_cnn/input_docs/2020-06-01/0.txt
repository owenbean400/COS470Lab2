South Korean health authorities identified 35 new coronavirus cases on Sunday -- all but five of which were locally transmitted . 
Of those , 24 are linked to religious group gatherings , the South Korean health ministry said at a briefing on Monday . 
The ministry did not specify whether those cases are tied to a single group or multiple groups . 
South Korea has been widely praised by public health experts as a model for how governments should respond to the novel coronavirus . 
Seoul 's emphasis on widespread testing and contact tracing has helped the country keep the number of total confirmed cases to fewer than 12,000 , including 271 deaths . 
Though the worst of the epidemic in the country appears to be over , several new clusters have been identified in recent weeks . 
One of the most recent emerged at a logistics center in Bucheon , a satellite city near Seoul . 
Authorities say 112 cases of Covid 19 have been identified in connection with that cluster , while thousands are currently under quarantine . 
There is concern that the cases tied to the religious group gatherings this weekend could be the first signs of a new cluster .
