South Korean health officials have warned residents to take current restrictions seriously , as the country faces the possibility of entering into its first potential lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic . 
South Korea has long been considered a model country for its effective Covid 19 response . 
Despite being among the first countries to be hit by the virus , it has managed to avoid the type of stringent lockdown measures seen elsewhere in the world , thanks largely to a combination of aggressive testing and sophisticated track and trace techniques . 
But as the pandemic drags on into winter , the emergence of a so called " third wave " has resulted in an apparently untraceable rise in new infections . 
Rising cases : On Tuesday , South Korea reported 1,078 new cases -- the country 's highest daily count yet -- bringing the national total to 45,442 , according to the Health Ministry . 
The majority of the cases were locally transmitted . 
Some 226 patients are in critical condition , while there were an additional 12 deaths Tuesday , increasing total fatalities to 612 . 
Speaking Wednesday , senior Health Ministry official Yoon Tae ho urged people to follow social distancing measures in the Seoul metropolitan area , which accounts for around half of the country 's 51 million population . 
Officials are now debating whether to raise restrictions to a higher alert level , with many concerned it could harm small businesses and the self employed . 
Last ICU bed : Seoul now only has one single ICU bed dedicated to Covid 19 left in the city , the acting mayor said on Wednesday . 
Some 77 of the total 78 dedicated beds are occupied by coronavirus patients . 
And 85.7 % of total dedicated beds across hospitals are occupied , adding extra strain to health systems that are already struggling . 
The city will secure 18 additional ICU beds by end of the year , authorities said .
