About 70 additional US military medical personnel will deploy to US installations in South Korea , a military official said . 
Their main mission will be to help test military personnel , their dependents and contractor personnel once test kits arrive from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
However , several officials say it is still not clear when those kits will arrive even though the outbreak in South Korea has grown in recent days . 
The medical personnel will provide clinical care and laboratory support and help identify personnel that have been exposed .
