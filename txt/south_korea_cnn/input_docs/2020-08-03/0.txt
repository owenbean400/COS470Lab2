Lee Man hee , the leader of the South Korean religious group Shincheonji , was arrested after being charged with embezzlement and violating South Korea 's Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Law . 
Lee was accused of submitting false information about the group 's gatherings and congregation list to the health authorities . 
Shincheonji is believed to be at the center of South Korea 's first major outbreak of Covid 19 in February . 
Shincheonji said in a statement that Lee has fully cooperated with authorities and called his arrest " regrettable . " 
A member of Shincheonji was the 31st person South Korea who was confirmed to have contracted Covid 19 . 
After the patient 's diagnosis , health authorities said they faced difficulty tracing the patient 's close contacts . 
South Korean police deployed hundreds of officers to trace members of the group who could not be reached . 
Lee issued a public apology in March , but denied accusations that he and his group have been hampering the health authorities â€™ efforts to contain and prevent infections . 
At the time , South Korea had identified more than 4,200 cases of Covid 19 , more than any country except mainland China . 
More than half of those were tied to Shincheonji .
