The religious group at the center of a novel coronavirus outbreak in South Korea has agreed to hand over a list of its entire congregation and their contact information to health authorities , according to South Korea â€™s vice health minister . 
About half of South Korea 's coronavirus cases are linked to a branch of the Shincheonji religious group in the southern city of Daegu . 
Kim said the group has also agreed to provide a list of members in other areas who visited the Daegu branch in January and February , and a list of members of the Daegu branch who visited other areas . 
" As soon as the congregation list is secured , the Central Disaster Management Headquarters will distribute it to health centers and local governments . " 
More than 9,000 practitioners have been put into self isolation while they are tested by health authorities . 
Who are they ? 
The Shincheonji group is a Christian inspired religious movement centered around the personality of its founder and chairman , Lee Man hee . 
The infection is believed to have spread rapidly because of the mass worship sessions the group holds , which puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time . 
Kim So il , a project director at Shincheonji , compared recent criticism of the group to a " 19th century witch hunt . " 
" It 's unfair that all people rebuke Shincheonji , " he told CNN , adding that the group was in " great difficulty right now . " 
Speaking Sunday , a Shincheonji representative told reporters that practitioners are the " biggest victims " of the virus , and urged people to " refrain from hate and groundless attack . "
