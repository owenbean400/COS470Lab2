The US and South Korea are expected to announce as soon as today that a critical joint military exercise has been scaled back because coronavirus is severely limiting the ability of both nation ’s militaries to participate , according to three US officials . 
What this could mean : This would be the first major impact of coronavirus on US military readiness according to the officials . 
Without the full exercise , the US could lose ground in being ready to conduct future operations in a coordinated and highly synchronized manner with the Republic of Korea against the north in a crisis one of the officials said . 
The two sides are discussing the final details of the reduced effort . 
The first exercise involved is a so called command post exercise scheduled to begin in the next several days . 
These types of exercises simulate the essential ability of top commanders and their senior staffs on both sides practicing precisely how they would operate together in a crisis . 
In the Republic of Korea , this is vital training as both sides would operate jointly in any combat crisis against North Korea . 
It is not yet clear if any field exercises will be affected . 
In Monday , US Defense Secretary Mark Esper only said the scale back was being considered but insisted it would not have a military impact . 
" I ’m sure that we ’ll remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we might face together , " Esper told reporters . 
But US officials say when exercises are scaled back or cancelled — as they were in August 2018 — capabilities are particularly impacted because of the regularly scheduled high rate of changes in assignments for both nations forces . 
That can mean each year more than 50 % of troops are replaced with newly assigned forces that may not have experience in commanding in Korea . 
South Korea now has more than 970 cases of coronavirus .
