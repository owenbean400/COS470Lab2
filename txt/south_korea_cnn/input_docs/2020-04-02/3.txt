The top US general in South Korea says that he does not believe North Korea â€™s claim it has no cases of novel coronavirus . 
" How many ? 
I could not tell you but I do know by their actions that for about 30 days in February , early March , that their military was locked down and they took draconian methods on their border crossings and in their formations . " 
North Korea has not reported any coronavirus infections , but it borders two of the most heavily affected countries in the region -- China and South Korea . 
While the 16th USFK related coronavirus infection was reported today , Abrams said the military force has managed to keep that number low . 
" We 've seen the worst but now is not the time to get complacent . 
Our worst is frankly not that bad , " Abrams said . 
He added that the 16 USFK related cases were reported out of 58,000 people in total , including 28,500 active military personnel , dependents and support staff for bases around the country . 
As USFK was among the first US military forces to have to deal with the virus worldwide , Abrams said he has advice for those now grappling with the spread around the world .
