South Korea plans to allocate roughly $ 9.8 billion ( 11.7 trillion Korean won ) to lessen the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak , Prime Minister Chung Sye kyun announced in a news conference today . 
The supplementary budget , which is the country â€™s largest ever dedicated to a contagious disease , will be submitted to the National Assembly for approval on Thursday . 
Chung said the economic impact of the novel coronavirus in South Korea is worse than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) outbreaks . 
In 2015 , South Korea allocated about $ 9.76 billion for MERS .
