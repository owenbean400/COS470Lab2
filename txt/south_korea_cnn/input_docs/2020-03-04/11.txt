South Korea has come up with a new way to make sure people self quarantined at home stay put : a GPS based app . 
The app will monitor people who are quarantined -- and if they leave their designated location , the system will set off an alarm . 
The application will be implemented later this week in Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang province , where about 90 % of national infections have been reported , according to the government . 
There are an estimated 2,300 people currently under quarantine in Daegu alone . 
South Korean authorities say several people have broken quarantine and left their homes . 
Currently , more than 2,000 confirmed patients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang province are waiting for beds . 
The South Korean government began categorizing confirmed cases so that patients with more serious health conditions can be hospitalized , while people with milder symptoms can be monitored from home or government designated facilities .
