South Korean authorities are conducting an administrative investigation at the headquarters of the Shincheonji religious group , which lies at the heart of the country 's outbreak . 
A joint team is conducting the investigation at the headquarters , located in Gwacheon , close to Seoul . 
The team consists of epidemiologists from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and forensic experts from the Prosecutors ' Office . 
The investigation was to verify lists of Shincheonji 's members and service attendees , said Kim Ganglip , Deputy of the Central Disaster Relief Headquarters , at a news briefing today . 
Shincheonji outbreak : More than half of all cases nationwide have links to a branch of the Shincheonji group in the country 's south . 
Many members and confirmed patients come from the city of Daegu , and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province . 
The group has been at the center of controversy these past two weeks ; police have accused the group of providing incomplete lists of its attendees , and the city of Seoul has filed a legal complaint against the group 's leaders on charges including homicide . 
In response , the group has insisted that it is fully cooperative and transparent , and that any omitted information was due to administrative delays -- even suggesting that the government was looking to " move the responsibility to Shincheonji . " 
Cases in South Korea : South Korea has confirmed 5,766 cases of the novel coronavirus and 35 deaths .
