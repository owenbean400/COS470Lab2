Face masks produced in South Korea will no longer be exported abroad as of tomorrow , the country 's vice finance minister said today . 
This move comes amid the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China , and after much public criticism of the government for severe shortages of face masks , resulting in citizens waiting long hours at designated locations to purchase them in limited numbers . 
The government had previously restricted the export of face masks , allowing up to 10 % of those produced to be exported until April 30 . 
South Korea has reported more than 5,700 cases of the virus and 35 deaths . 
Face mask supply : South Korea is aiming to increase its daily mask output from 10 million to at least 13 million , authorities said . 
Masks will be distributed mainly to pharmacies , post offices , and government locations for citizens to purchase . 
Starting from Monday , each citizen can purchase up to two masks per week . 
The government will monitor sales through a computerized system , to prevent people from buying more than their share . 
The government will also designate certain days of the week for citizens to purchase masks after presenting their identification cards , to avoid big crowds of shoppers . 
Mask price : The finance ministry will also price all masks distributed by the government at $ 1.27 ( 1,500 Korean won ) , and it may set a maximum price limit for private sellers . 
The government will reward anyone who reports on illegal business transactions of mask sales .
