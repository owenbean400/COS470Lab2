South Korea designated the southeastern city of Gyeongsan as a third " special care zone " today as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the country . 
Half of the coronavirus cases in Gyeongsan are members of or have links to the Shincheonji religious group , which is at the heart of South Korea 's outbreak , according to Kwon Joon wook , vice director of the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The other two " special care zones " are Daegu , a southern city where most of the Shincheonji linked cases have occurred , and Cheongdo , right outside Daegu . 
When authorities designated Daegu and Cheongdo as " special care zones " two weeks ago , Prime Minister Chung Sye kyun said it was because these areas were " experiencing difficulties due to a sudden increase in confirmed cases , " and that the government would send military medical staff for assistance . 
South Korea has reported more than 5,700 cases of the virus and 35 deaths .
