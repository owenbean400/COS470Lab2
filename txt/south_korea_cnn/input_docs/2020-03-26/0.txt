Travelers from the US and Europe entering South Korea will now be required to download a government self quarantine smartphone app , according to the country â€™s Central Disaster Relief Headquarters . 
The app will remind users to check their symptoms every day , and will monitor their location to confirm they are following the quarantine order . 
Those violating quarantine without a proper reason will be immediately reported to the authorities , and deported if they are foreign citizens . 
Police will immediately respond to the site when a person leaves their quarantine without authorization .
