In the South Korean city of Daegu , the outbreak has been centered around the Shincheonji religious group . 
Some 300 members of the group have tested positive for the virus , and more than 9,000 practitioners have been put into self isolation while they are tested by health authorities . 
The infection is believed to have spread rapidly because of the mass worship sessions the group holds , which puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time .

Of South Koreans who identify as religious , more than 60 % belong to a mainstream Christian denomination .
