In South Korea , 201 coronavirus cases have now been linked to a nightclub cluster in the capital Seoul , health officials said today . 
The cluster , which was identified on May 9 , has been traced to the entertainment district of Itaewon . 
After cases began emerging , authorities used credit card records , cell phone data , and other methods to identify people who had visited the affected area . 
Tens of thousands of people have now been tested in relation to the cluster . 
The cluster is sparking other closures . 
A patient linked to the cluster used a coin operated karaoke room in the city of Incheon . 
Two high school students then used that room , contracted the virus and passed it onto their families , said health official Yoon Tae ho . 
Incheon is now closing all such coin operated karaoke rooms . 
A total of 66 Incheon high schools closed yesterday , and will conduct classes online while authorities carry out epidemiological studies . 
Meanwhile , in the southern city of Daegu , a high school sent all students home and closed after a student tested positive for the virus this morning , said an official at the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education . 
In February , when South Korea 's case numbers exploded , Daegu was at the heart of the country 's outbreak . 
Many of the cases were linked to the Shincheonji religious group , a branch of which was based in the city .
