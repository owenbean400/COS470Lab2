A small experiment involving patients with coronavirus who wore cotton and surgical masks showed that both seemed ineffective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus when the patients coughed . 
Scientists found coronavirus particles in the environment and on the exterior of the mask itself . 
The experiment was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine . 
Scientists tested face masks on four patients infected with the coronavirus at two hospitals in Seoul , South Korea . 
They compared the use of surgical masks with reusable 100 % cotton masks against patients who were not wearing masks . 
The researchers placed a petri dish about 7 inches from the patients ’ mouths and told the patient to cough five times each onto a petri dish . 
Researchers saw greater contamination on the outer surface of the mask , compared to the inner surface . 
It was unclear if the force of the person ’s cough leaked out of the edge of the mask to contaminate the outer surface , or if the particles of the coronavirus were so small that a high velocity cough penetrated the mask . 
The experiment did not look at the effectiveness of N95 masks , nor did it show if the masks protected against the actual transmission of infection from patients with Covid 19 while wearing different masks . 
Nor does it show if masks shorten the distance these droplets travel while someone is coughing . 
More research will be needed to determine if the masks help prevent the spread of the disease with people who are asymptomatic or people who have Covid 19 and are not coughing .
