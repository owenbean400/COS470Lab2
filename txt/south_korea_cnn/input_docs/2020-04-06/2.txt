South Korea ’s football captain , Son Heung Min , will carry out mandatory military service with the Marine Corps in his homeland as football ’s coronavirus shutdown continues , his agent has confirmed to CNN . 
The 27 year old returned to South Korea on Saturday 28 March and is in the process of completing his 14 days in self quarantine . 
Military service : Under South Korean law , all able bodied men between the ages of 18 and 35 are required to perform at least 21 months of military service . 
However , any South Korean athletes who win Olympic medals or Asian Games titles are exempt from military conscription . 
Son , who represents English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur at club level , earned his exemption in 2018 when he led South Korea to win the football gold medal at the Asian Games in Indonesia . 
Despite the exemption , athletes are still required by law to serve a mandatory four week national service in the South Korean military – albeit with the Marine Corps being an exception of three weeks . 
Premier League suspended : On Friday it was confirmed the England ’s Premier League season had been indefinitely suspended amid the ongoing pandemic with the League announcing it would resume play " only when it is safe and appropriate to do so . "
