US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams believes Florida can turn things around in time to reopen schools in August , Adams told CNN . 
Earlier this week , Adams said transmission rates needed to go down before schools could reopen . 
CNN shared with Adams the latest data from the Florida Department of Health , showing that the positivity rate in the state has ranged from 13 % to 18 % in the past two weeks and that the 14 day average positivity rate in Miami Dade County is 20 % . 
The school year in Florida begins in August . 
" I do think it ’s possible in about a month , " Adams said . 
" We ’ve seen places around the United States and around the world turn around very high case rates in just a few weeks . 
The disease course is only two weeks . 
That ’s how long it takes coronavirus to go through your system . 
That means we can break the cycle if we can do the right thing in just a couple of weeks . 
It will probably take a couple of cycles . 
But a month is enough time to for us to turn around these case rates . " 
During a live address Wednesday , Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis argued for the reopening of schools in part because children , he said , were at a lower risk and played the " smallest role in transmission " of the virus . 
CNN asked Adams about a South Korea study published this week by the CDC that concluded minors between the ages of 10 to 19 spread the virus at least as well as adults . 
Adams said the study is credible . 
" It 's important to know that for younger people , the virus is lower risk for complications than death . 
But low risk does not mean no risk , " Adams said .
