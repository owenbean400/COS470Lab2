Patients who re tested positive for coronavirus after being discharged are not contagious , South Korean health officials said Monday . 
The Korean Centre for Disease Control ( KCDC ) made the announcement after conducting a lab analysis of 108 cases and epidemiology investigations on 285 cases to determine whether coronavirus patients should be quarantined for two weeks after being released from hospital . 
Health officials tested 790 close contacts of the 285 cases who re tested positive for the virus after recovering , but found no infections linked to the recovered patients . 
What this means : Following the announcement , the country 's health officials removed the guideline recommending recovered patients to undergo a further two weeks of quarantine after being released from hospitals and other healthcare facilities . 
The Director of the KCDC , Jung Eun kyeong , said health authorities could not say why some patients were re testing positive for the virus , but added that experts believed the PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) test was detecting pieces of dead virus . 
When a positive specimen was isolated and cultivated , coronavirus was not detected in PCR tests , so the experts concluded the virus was not infectious , Jung added .
