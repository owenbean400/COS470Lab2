Preliminary results from clinical trials of an experimental antiviral drug for coronavirus could come in a week , a top researcher said Sunday . 
The final test results for the drug , remdesivir , are not expected until mid to late May , said Dr . Andre Kalil , a principal investigator for the trial . 
But he said the team might " potentially have some early data in the next one or two weeks . " 
Remdesivir was originally tested by Gilead Sciences as a potential treatment for Ebola , and it showed activity against the novel coronavirus in test tubes . 
But whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid 19 remains unclear . 
The new study , sponsored by the National Institutes of Health , is a randomized , double blind , placebo controlled trial -- meaning neither the patients nor their doctors know who is receiving the real drug and who is receiving a placebo . 
Patients finished enrolling for the study last Sunday , Kalil said , adding that their number had exceeded the target of 572 . 
The trial began at the University of Nebraska Medical Center , where Kalil is a professor of medicine , but it has expanded to nearly 70 sites around the world , from South Korea to Germany . 
Data on remdesivir is confusing at best . 
Earlier this month , the maker of the drug , Gilead released information on 53 patients , most of whom showed improvement after receiving infusions of remdesivir . 
Information leaked to STAT News suggested that patients receiving remdesivir were recovering quickly , but the report was based on a recorded discussion of a clinical trial , and offered few details . 
Last week , the World Health Organization accidentally published a summary of results from a trial of the drug in coronavirus patients . 
A screenshot published by STAT showed " remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement . " 
But that trial was terminated early due to low enrolment , and Gilead said it was inconclusive .
