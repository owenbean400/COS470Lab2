Smokers and former smokers , including e cigarette users , have a significantly greater risk of developing severe cases of Covid 19 and dying from the illness than their non smoking counterparts , according to a new study from the University of California , San Francisco . 
The meta analysis , or study of studies , looked at 19 peer reviewed papers from China , South Korea and the United States . 
It found 30 % of smokers developed more severe forms of Covid 19 compared to 17.6 % of non smokers . 
" Smoking and e cigarette use increase the risk and severity of pulmonary infections because of damage to upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function in general , although these effects have not yet been studied for SARS COV 2 , the virus that causes COVID 19 , " they wrote . 
" Smokers have a known higher risk of infection and mortality from MERS COV , a viral respiratory illness caused by a different coronavirus . " 
The analysis likely underestimated how smoking affects the risk of contracting the coronavirus in the general population , the authors said , because the studies the analysis is based on were only focused on those who had already developed Covid 19 . 
But the authors urged health officials to add smoking cessation for both tobacco and e cigarette products to the list of steps needed to curb the pandemic , and are advocating for more data collection on smokers and e cigarette users to see if they â€™re at greater risk of contracting the disease .
