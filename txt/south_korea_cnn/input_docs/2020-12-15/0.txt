South Korea recorded 880 new coronavirus cases on Monday , according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency ( KDCA ) . 
Of the new cases , 32 were imported . 
The country also recorded 13 additional virus related deaths . 
The new figures raise the country 's total to 44,364 confirmed cases and 600 fatalities . 
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye kyun said the government was now weighing up whether to introduce the highest level of coronavirus restrictions . 
Alert levels in South Korea range from 1 -- the least concerning situation -- to 3 , signifying the toughest measures necessary . 
Levels rise in increments of 0.5 . Currently , the country is at Level 2 national alert , but the greater Seoul area and the southeastern port city of Busan are at Level 2.5 -- the second highest level . 
If the government raises the alert to the highest level , that means a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people , work from home for all non essential employees , and a shift to online for all schools and church services . 
" Considering the gravity and impact of Level 3 measures , there is a need to calmly check on ourselves first -- if we â€™re abiding by the current measures properly , " Chung said , adding that raising the alert to Level 3 would " come with irreversible pain . "
