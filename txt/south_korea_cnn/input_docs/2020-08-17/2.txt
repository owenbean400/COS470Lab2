New Zealand has postponed its general election for four weeks over coronavirus concerns -- despite only having 58 active cases in the community . 
The country of 5 million people -- which has been praised for its handling of the virus -- went 102 days without any locally transmitted cases , only to see a fresh outbreak last week . 
The election had been scheduled for September 19 , but on Monday , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced she was delaying it until October 17 . 
This year , New Zealand will also be holding two referendums alongside its election : on legalizing euthanasia , and on legalizing cannabis for recreational use . 
Several developed countries have gone ahead with their elections during the pandemic , including South Korea , which even saw its highest turn out in almost 30 years during its parliamentary election in April . 
Why has the election been delayed ? 
Ardern said she wanted to postpone voting to give the Electoral Commission time to prepare -- and give parties time to campaign . 
New Zealand ’s most populous city , Auckland , is currently under lockdown , meaning any candidates based there would be unable to campaign as usual . 
Most people within New Zealand must vote at specific locations , although they can apply to vote by mail . 
Voting opens two weeks before Election Day , so not everyone needs to vote on the same day . 
Ardern said Monday that she would not change the election date again . 
Will this help Ardern ’s chance ? 
According to polling , Ardern 's Labour Party is on track to win the election -- and is well ahead of the main opposition National Party . 
The delay will give her opponents more time to attempt to win support . 
But , if the polls are anything to go by , they have a lot of ground to make up . 
Has there been any pushback ? 
Not really . 
Other parties pushed for the election to be delayed , and following Ardern 's announcement , several parties welcomed the decision .
