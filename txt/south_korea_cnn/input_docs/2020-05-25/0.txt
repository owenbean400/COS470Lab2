South Korea will adopt a cell phone QR code based logging system for patrons of entertainment venues from June to aid contact tracing , it was announced Monday . 
Places like clubs , karaoke bars and restaurants must use the system , having been designated as high risk facilities by authorities . 
Customers will need to receive a QR code at venue entrances using an app , with their information then logged by management . 
People who refuse to use QR code downloading , or who do not have cell phones , must still log their identification details with staff . 
According to the government , the information provided will be available for epidemiological investigation purposes only , and automatically discarded after four weeks . 
The system will be used when the country â€™s infectious disease alert level is at its two highest levels , health official Yoon Tae ho said at a briefing .
