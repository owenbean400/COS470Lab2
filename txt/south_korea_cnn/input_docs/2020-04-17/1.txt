Apple said it is reopening its retail store in Seoul as South Korea continues to make progress in stopping the spread of coronavirus . 
The Apple Garosugil store will open on Saturday at midday , a spokesperson for the company told CNN . 
Apple closed all its stores in mainland China in February and then shut all its stores outside Greater China in March as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world . 
The Seoul location will be Apple 's first store outside of mainland China to reopen its doors . 
Customers will still be able to buy Apple products in Seoul , by ordering online for delivery or pick up in store , Apple said . 
" We also have a number of service and support options available online for anyone who needs help with their Apple products , " the statement said . 
The company 's stores in China reopened last month .
