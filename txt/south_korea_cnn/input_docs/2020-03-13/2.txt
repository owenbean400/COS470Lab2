Nearly 90 % of all cases nationwide are from Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province . 
Signs of slowdown : The country 's health minister told CNN earlier this week that he hopes the recent slowdown in cases meant they had " passed the peak " of the outbreak . 
The country saw its cases skyrocket in February , with most cases linked to a religious group based in Daegu -- but the past month has also seen widespread , aggressive testing that experts credit for South Korea 's success in early detection and containment .
