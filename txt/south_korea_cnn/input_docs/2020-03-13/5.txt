Before there were any cases of novel coronavirus confirmed in South Korea , one of the country 's biotech firms had begun preparing to make testing kits to identify the disease . 
On January 16 , Chun Jong yoon , the chief executive and founder of molecular biotech company Seegene , told his team it was time to start focusing on coronavirus . 
That was before the virus sweeping China had been named Covid 19 and four days ahead of South Korea confirming its first case . 
" Even if nobody is asking us to , we are a molecular diagnosis company . 
We have to prepare in advance , " he remembered thinking at the time . 
Fast forward two months , and South Korea is among the world 's worst affected countries , with nearly 8,000 people infected , according to the World Health Organization . 
But one reason why South Korea might have a higher number of infections than other countries is its aggressive approach to testing . 
While some nations have struggled to get enough test kits to diagnose suspected patients , South Korea has provided free and easy access to testing for anyone who a doctor deems needs it . 
To date , the country has tested more than 230,000 people . 
Part of the reason it was able to do that is the availability of test kits developed by companies like Seegene .
