South Korea has tested more than 230,000 people for free and set up drive thru testing weeks ago . Meanwhile , the US vice president and the Health and Human Services secretary said this week they do not know how many Americans have been tested . 
But members of both parties say there are not nearly enough tests available . 
There are a few factors for the difference in responses , said Dr . Rob Davidson , an emergency room doctor and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare . 
" The public health infrastructure and the response to outbreaks and the National Security Council have been gutted by this administration , " Davidson said . 
Two years ago , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries , including China , after the Trump administration refused to reallocate money to a program that started during the government 's response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 . 
At that time , former CDC director Dr . Tom Frieden said the move " would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world . " 
Another factor involves the tests themselves — including malfunctions , shortages and delays in availability . 
In the first few weeks of coronavirus in the US , the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results . 
" We had the ability about five weeks ago to use a WHO — World Health Organization — approved test that 's been used in other countries that was available , and that was rejected so we could use a test that was developed here , " Davidson said . 
After test kits were later sent across the country , some were flawed . 
" So they go back to the drawing board , " Davidson said . 
" It put us behind by about four or five weeks . "
