Scott Minerd managed money during the 2008 financial crisis and the bursting of the dotcom bubble . 
But the influential investor said he fears the coronavirus outbreak impact could exceed those events . 
" This is possibly the worst thing I 've seen in my career , " Minerd , chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners , told Bloomberg TV today . 
Pointing to the spike in cases in South Korea and Italy , Minerd said the outbreak has the potential to " reel into something extremely serious . " 
Some context : The S&P 500 plunged into a correction today , signifying a 10 % decline from previous highs . 
All three indexes are on track for their worst weekly percentage drops since October 2008 â€” and Minerd warned stocks could plunge further if the outbreak is not contained .
