There are " ongoing " conversations at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about expanding airport health screenings for the novel coronavirus given the rapid spread of the infection in Italy , South Korea and Japan , according to an agency spokesperson . 
Currently , the United States is doing health screenings only for passengers who are flying in from China . 
At the time that the CDC made the decision to start those screenings , there were far fewer cases of the coronavirus in China as there are currently in Japan , Italy or South Korea . 
When the screening started on January 17 , there were 45 cases of the new coronavirus in China . 
Japan currently has about three times that number of cases , Italy has about 10 times as many and South Korea has more than 25 times as many .
