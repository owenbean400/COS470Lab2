Businessman Son Young ha , 31 , is living at the center of South Korea 's coronavirus outbreak . 
Out of the more than 1,700 cases of the virus that South Korea has confirmed , more than 1,100 are from the southern city of Daegu . 
On the streets , Son said that there are fewer cars and restaurants are less crowded . 
" It 's a lot quieter than before . 
People seem to be careful of the situation , " he told CNN over Skype . 
But despite that , he says he is not overly concerned and claims reports of runs on supermarkets and queues for masks are exaggerated . 
" Even if you go to a market or a convenience store in front of the house , there â€™s no shortage of food , " he said . 
" We do not doubt the central government and local governments are doing their best , so rather than overwhelming fears , we think that if we work together to deal with the situation , we can overcome it . "
