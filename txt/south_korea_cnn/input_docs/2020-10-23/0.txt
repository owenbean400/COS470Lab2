A coronavirus outbreak has been reported at a Los Angeles megachurch that has defied the county ’s public health orders and held indoor services since August . 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Thursday confirmed three positive cases linked to Grace Community Church in the Sun Valley neighborhood of L.A. ’s San Fernando Valley . 
Over the past two months , Grace Community Church was cited nine times by the public health department for failing to comply with health officer orders , according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ’s website . 
Grace Community Church did not immediately respond to CNN ’s request for a comment . 
Despite the county ’s public health order , which prohibits indoor services in any house of worship , Grace Community Church announced in July it would remain open to congregants for in person worship . 
Instead of listening to government or public health officials , the church said it would choose to follow " the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ . " 
" We gladly choose to obey Him , " the church added . 
While no further details of the outbreak or investigation were provided , the public health department said it will " work closely with the church to support outbreak management strategies that can limit transmission of COVID 19 . " 
Religious groups have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks in several countries , including South Korea .
