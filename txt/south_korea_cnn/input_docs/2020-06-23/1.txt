A second wave of coronavirus outbreak is already underway in South Korea , according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) . 
KCDC director Jung Eun kyeong told a briefing on Monday that the current wave began during the May holiday period . 
She said the first wave ended in April after the number of daily new cases decreased to around 10 or below for a number of days before trending very slightly upward in early May . Jung said it was hard to say whether this was a large scale outbreak but regional outbreaks were occurring and more are expected . 
With the number of cases expected to increase in the autumn and winter months , Jung added that health authorities are readying enough beds to deal with a large scale outbreak . 
According to the KCDC , 12,484 people in the country have so far been infected with the virus , with 280 deaths .
