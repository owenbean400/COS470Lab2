In South Korea , a total of 259 coronavirus cases have now been linked to a cluster in Seoul 's entertainment district of Itaewon , known for its nightclubs and bars . 
It may also have given rise to a second cluster , which authorities are now racing to contain . 
The nightclub cluster emerged on May 9 , after an infected person visited multiple clubs . 
In the following weeks , authorities tested tens of thousands of people who were in either in the area or may have been indirectly exposed . 
One person , who had been infected from the nightclub cluster , visited a buffet restaurant . 
Then , another diner there was reported infected -- and brought it back to a logistics center in the city of Bucheon . 
36 cases have now been linked to that logistics center -- 32 employees and four of their family members , according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Authorities estimate up to 4,000 people may have been exposed to the virus through this cluster , and so far have conducted about 1,920 tests . 
City and health officials are still carrying out the epidemiological investigation , said the KCDC .
