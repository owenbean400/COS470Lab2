Although promising , vaccines " will not stop the virus " and are not a " silver bullet " to ending the pandemic , a top World Health Organization official told a news conference hosted on Zoom Thursday . 
Dr . Takeshi Kasai , WHO regional director for the Western Pacific , made the comments as he was giving an update on the region â€™s progress in dealing with the Covid 19 pandemic . 
When asked by CNN when the world could hope to go back to normal , Kasai said that " the answer to this question depends on all of us . 
And the individual actions that we take now and into the future . " 
He said the initial number of vaccines will be limited and that high risk groups should be prioritized . 
While the Americas and Europe were facing challenging Covid 19 situations , Kasai said the Western Pacific had fared " comparatively well " but should " keep preparing for the worst case scenario . " 
Younger people are getting infected : Dr . Babatunde Olowokure , WHO Western Pacific regional emergency director , added that the trend of infections had shifted from older generations to the 20-29 age group because of " increased mobility " following the relaxation of restrictions , and also because of a " low level of perceived threat in young people " leading to " complacency . " 
Olowokure added that the death toll remained highest for people aged over 80 . 
Although the Western Pacific was doing well in global terms , Olowokure also said that the " seven day moving average is showing upward trends in our region " with the most notable increases of infections in South Korea , Japan and Malaysia .
