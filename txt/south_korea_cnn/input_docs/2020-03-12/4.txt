Rep . 
Jan Schawkowsky said that they were told 7,300 tests have been conducted by the public sector and 3,800 tests by private labs . 
" I think everyone leaving that briefing is feeling more confused than ever and disappointed in the numbers that we heard — that we really do not have a system that tests are being distributed and tests are being given , " Schakowsky said
