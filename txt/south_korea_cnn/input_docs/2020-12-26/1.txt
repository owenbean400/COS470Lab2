South Korea will require additional coronavirus tests for travelers from South Africa before they can be released from 14 day mandatory quarantine upon arrival in the country , the government said in a press release Saturday . 
If a traveler from South Africa tests positive for the coronavirus , the government will conduct additional testing for the new variant spreading in the UK , the Disease Control and Prevention Agency added in the statement . 
A similar variant to the one identified in the UK has been discovered in South Africa , where scientists say it is spreading quickly along coastal areas . 
On Wednesday , South Korea suspended flights from the UK until December 31 due to concerns over the new variant . 
It also suspended the issuance of quarantine exemptions at South Korean consulates in the UK . 
All travelers from the UK must undergo 14 days of quarantine and take an extra coronavirus test .
