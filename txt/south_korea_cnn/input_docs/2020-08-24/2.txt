Almost 2,000 schools in South Korea have suspended in person classes due to the latest surge of coronavirus cases , according to a statement from the country â€™s Ministry of Education on Monday . 
The announcement affects 1,845 schools across the nation , the first time since May that more than 1,000 schools will be closed , said the ministry . 
A total of 283 students and 79 faculty members have tested positive for novel coronavirus since May 20 when South Korea began a phased return of pupils to the classroom , according to the ministry . 
Countries around the world are currently grappling with how to keep children learning during the pandemic . 
The world is facing a " generational catastrophe " because of school closures during the coronavirus pandemic , UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned at the beginning of August . 
" Getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority , " once local transmission of Covid 19 is under control , Guterres added .
