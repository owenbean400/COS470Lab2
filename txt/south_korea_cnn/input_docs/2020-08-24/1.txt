South Korea 's President Moon said that the country is facing a new virus crisis and that it is much more severe than dealing with the controversial church cluster in its first wave . 
" We are facing a new crisis . 
It 's a much more severe emergency than the Shincheonji situation in the early days of the Covid 19 crisis , " said Moon . 
" Seoul and the metropolitan area have become the centers of spread , and nowhere else in the country is safe . " 
If health officials were unable to curb the spread of the virus then the social distancing level will be raised to Alert Level 3 which would mean " daily life will be stopped , jobs will be collapsed and a huge economic blow should be endured , " warned Moon . 
" Even the medical system could collapse , " the President said in a meeting with senior advisors in Seoul on Monday . 
Moon said that the effort to stem the spread of the virus in South Korea is being hampered because " some in our society are challenging the nation 's disease prevention system and blatantly obstructing or refusing to cooperate the health effort . " 
The latest outbreak in South Korea has been linked to churches in Seoul and the neighboring provinces . 
Members of religious groups have been criticized for withholding key information and obstructing public health authorities in their fight against the pandemic . 
" We cannot tolerate individual transgressions such as non cooperation in disease prevention or quarantine violation by refusing administrative orders . 
The damage to people is already too great . 
It has hurt the lives and health of many people , stopped their daily lives , and hurt the economy and employment , " Moon told his senior advisors .
