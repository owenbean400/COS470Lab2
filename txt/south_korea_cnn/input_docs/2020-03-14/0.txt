South Korea confirmed 107 new coronavirus cases Friday , bringing the national total to 8,086 , according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) . 
It was the lowest daily increase since February 22 , and followed a week long trend of diminishing case numbers . 
Of the new cases , 62 are from the southern city of Daegu , where the outbreak has been concentrated . 
Another six are from North Gyeongsang Province , which surrounds Daegu . 
About 88 % of all cases nationwide are from Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province . 
Thirteen new cases are from Seoul , where a new cluster was identified at a call center this week . 
The KCDC also confirmed another five coronavirus deaths , taking the country 's toll to 72 . 
Slowdown after aggressive response : Earlier this week , South Korea 's health minister told CNN he hoped the country had " passed the peak " of the outbreak . 
Numbers spiked in February , with clusters linked to the Shincheonji religious group â€” and officials responded with fast , accessible testing , contact tracing , and a widespread public health campaign . 
Authorities also turned to creative technologies like GPS to monitor home quarantines and a smartphone app to collect citizens ' symptom reports every day .
