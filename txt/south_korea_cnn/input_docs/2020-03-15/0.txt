Spike in Japan : The spike in Japan 's numbers come as the crisis appears to be stabilizing in other Asian countries . 
South Korea and mainland China , the two hardest hit countries in the region , have both a slowdown in infections and deaths this week . 
But Japan has seen its numbers jump -- just earlier this week , health officials said the average rate of infection was 30 new cases per day . 
The spike in numbers , and the broader global pandemic , have sparked calls to cancel the Tokyo 2020 Olympics -- but organizers say preparations are continuing .
