All in person church services will be suspended in light of the recent virus outbreak in South Korea 's capital city and surrounding provinces , Prime Minister Chung Sye kyun said Tuesday . 
In a televised address , Chung said that South Korea was at a critical crossroads , where failure to contain the current cluster would lead to a nationwide epidemic . 
The number of virus cases remained in triple digits , with 246 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours , the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday . 
Seoul church cluster : Tracing congregations who attended church services is proving difficult in South Korea , Chung said , as inaccurate attendee lists made it hard to contact trace after a cluster was identified . 
On Monday , Seoul 's government reported a cluster of cases related to a church in the city . 
More than 450 people linked to the Sarang jeil church have tested positive for the virus , authorities said . 
Chung said that church members are spread throughout the country increasing " the possibility of transmission to other districts . " 
Online church services would be permitted but all other gatherings and events were banned , Chung said . 
Churches are among 12 high risk venues which will be shuttered . 
Clubs , karaoke bars , buffet restaurants , and internet cafes will also be closed in Seoul , the neighboring Gyeonggi Province and Incheon .
