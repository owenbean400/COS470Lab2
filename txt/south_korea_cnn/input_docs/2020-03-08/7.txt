The Bahrain Formula 1 Grand Prix race weekend will be held without spectators to battle the spread of coronavirus , event organizers said on Sunday . 
" Given the continued spread of Covid 19 globally , convening a major sporting event , which is open to the public and allows thousands of international travelers and local fans to interact in close proximity would not be the right thing to do at the present time , " a statement on the official website said . 
The Bahrain edition of the season was set to be held between March 20-22 . 
The country has confirmed 83 coronavirus cases , according to the Ministry of Health . 
On Sunday , the ministry called on people arriving from four designated countries -- Italy , South Korea , Egypt and Lebanon -- to observe a 14 day home quarantine .
