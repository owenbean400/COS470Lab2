The South Korean government has approved a private organization 's request to send Covid 19 relief products to North Korea . 
The group , the Inter Korean Economic Cooperation Research Center ( IKECRC ) , said it plans to send 10,000 virus test kits , 20 thermal cameras and a real time PCR test set to Pyongyang . 
Kim Han shin , who leads IKECRC , said the South Korean Unification Ministry approved the shipment on Friday . 
North Korea has not publicly confirmed the existence of a single case of Covid 19 , but experts are dubious that the virus did not cross into its borders at some point . 
However , Pyongyang is taking the virus ' threat very seriously . 
The city of Kaesong was placed under lockdown last month after reports that a North Korean defector might have returned to the country from South Korea while possibly infected . 
The goods are worth about $ 1 million , he said . 
The shipment is not a violation of the punitive United Nations sanctions levied on North Korea for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program . 
The UN Security Council approved IKECRC 's sanctions exemption requests last month , shortly before the South Korean government gave its own assent . 
According to Kim , his group was able to raise funds for these products through help from a local government , but he did not reveal which local government that was . 
Since the coronavirus outbreak , 40 tons of disinfectant and 20,000 hazmat suits have been sent to North Korea by private groups from South Korea , a Unification Ministry official said . 
The disinfectants and hazmat suits arrived in North Korea in early May and late July , respectively , according to the ministry .
