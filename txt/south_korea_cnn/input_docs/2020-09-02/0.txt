Nearly 200 people have been indicted in South Korea for clashes over face mask requirements on public transportation , according to the country 's vice health minister . 
The government imposed the mandatory face mask rule on public transport on May 26 . 
Those who violate the rule can be denied entry onto public transit -- but this has led to several violent confrontations between mask less individuals and drivers , conductors , or other passengers , the country 's National Police Agency said . 
Authorities have investigated 385 people for such incidents , of which 198 were indicted and arrested . 
Vice Health Minister Kim Ganglip said on Wednesday that authorities are taking violations of this mandate very seriously , adding that nine other people are currently under arrest . 
South Korea has reported a total of 20,449 confirmed cases of Covid 19 and 326 deaths from the virus .
