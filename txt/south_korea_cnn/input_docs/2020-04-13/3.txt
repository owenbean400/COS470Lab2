The United States is turning to South Korea — a country with an aggressive testing regime that the President Trump previously downplayed — to bring approximately 750,000 more coronavirus tests to the US , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency . 
FEMA , an agency within the Department of Homeland Security , awarded contracts to manufacturers in South Korea last week to provide approximately 750,000 tests , according to a FEMA spokesperson and federal records . 
Over the weekend , the first shipment of 150,000 tests were delivered to the US by Sol Gent . 
The next shipment of 600,000 tests will arrive on April 15 . 
They are being provided by two South Korea based companies , SD Biosensor and Osang Healthcare . 
The intent , the FEMA spokesperson said , is to move the tests to a cold storage facility in Louisville , Kentucky , for distribution . 
Urgent needs will be given priority , according to a FEMA advisory obtained by CNN . 
The Trump administration has waffled on its praise of South Korea ’s testing capabilities . 
Trump acknowledged on Twitter in late March that South Korea has been very successful regarding testing . 
By April , Trump claimed that US tests are faster and more accurate than South Korea 's . 
But facing a testing shortage and governors desperate to bolster their testing capability , the US has had to look abroad .
