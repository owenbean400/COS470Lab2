The management of South Korean boyband BTS have apologized after one of the band 's members went to bars while the country 's strict social distancing rules were in place . 
BTS , which has seven members , is one of the biggest bands in the world -- last year it became the first group in Billboard history to spend five weeks at number one on the Billboard Artist 100 chart . 
Jungkook -- who , at 22 , is the band 's youngest member -- visited bars and restaurants in Seoul 's nightlife district Itaewon on April 25 , BTS ' label Big Hit Entertainment said in a statement on Monday . 
At the time , South Korea was still under strict social distancing rules , and citizens were encouraged to stay home and limit unnecessary contact with others . 
Those social distancing rules were lifted on May 6 . 
A total of 187 coronavirus cases have been linked to an Itaewon nightclub cluster , Kwon Jun wook , deputy director of the country 's Central Disease Control Headquarters , said in a briefing on Tuesday . 
The first reported case as part of this cluster was a 29 year old man who visited several clubs in Itaewon on the night of May 1 and the early hours of May 2 . 
In the statement , Big Hit said that Jungkook went out with friends on April 25 .
