It is still unknown whether being infected with the coronavirus and recovering will give you immunity from the virus in the future , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said on CBS today . 
When asked whether the US could see a resurgence in cases , like in South Korea , and if that was a result of those being infected not building immunity , Birx said " those are questions we still have scientifically . " 
Aside from HIV , people who contract most infectious diseases and recover develop antibodies , which often means people are immune . 
But " we just do not know if it â€™s immunity for a month , immunity for six months , immunity for six years , " Birx said .
