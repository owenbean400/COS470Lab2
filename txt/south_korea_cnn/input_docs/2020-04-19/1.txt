Sixteen more people who had recovered from coronavirus and were released from quarantine have tested positive again for the infection , South Korea 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) reported on Sunday . 
This means that 179 people in total have retested positive after they were released from quarantine , out of 8,042 patients who 've recovered from Covid 19 so far , KCDC director Jung Eun Kyeong told a press briefing . 
It is currently unclear why patients could be retesting positive . 
Most experts think it 's unlikely that somebody will be reinfected right after recovering . 
It 's possible that issues with testing -- or varying amounts of viral RNA in the body , which the tests look for -- could explain why people test positive after testing negative , experts say . 
An in depth epidemiological investigation is underway to figure out the cause , Jung said . 
Among all of the cases who have retested positive , patients in their 20s made up the highest number , with 41 cases ( 22.9 % ) , followed by patients in their 50s , with 32 cases ( 17.9 % ) , according to the KCDC . 
Most such cases test positive after an average of about 13 days following release from quarantine , Jung added , and so far no secondary infections have been reported from these cases .
