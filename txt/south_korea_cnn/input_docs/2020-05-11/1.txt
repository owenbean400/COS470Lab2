" It 's not over until it 's over . " 
That was South Korean President Moon Jae in , speaking Sunday after a new cluster of coronavirus cases emerged in the country 's capital Seoul , sparking fear of a second wave of infections in the East Asian country . 
South Korea was among the first places to deal with a major coronavirus epidemic , and seemed to be on track to loosen restrictions , after weeks of social distancing measures and careful surveillance . 
But the new cluster seems to have put an end to that , for now , with Moon warning his people " we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention . " 
China too , is introducing renewed restrictions after two cities reported new cases of the virus . 
Shulan , in Jilin province in the country 's far northeast , has been put under lockdown , following 11 newly confirmed cases . 
Jilin borders both Russia and North Korea , and concerns have previously been raised over imported cases from overseas causing a renewed outbreak . 
More alarming are the new cluster of infections in Wuhan , the central Chinese city where cases of the novel coronavirus were first detected late last year . 
Wuhan was the first city in the world to enter into lockdown , only returning to relative normality late last month after 76 days . 
On Monday , city officials said five new cases had been confirmed in the city , none of which were imported from overseas . 
While that is a far cry from the figures at the beginning of the crisis , or those being reported daily across much of western Europe and the United States right now , the apparent ability of the virus to continue spreading undetected -- especially in a city as intensely surveilled and restricted as Wuhan -- will lead to concerns about the viability of reopening .
