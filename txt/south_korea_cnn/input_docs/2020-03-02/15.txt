President Donald Trump said Monday he is still considering additional travel restrictions for countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks . 
" Yes , we are , " the President said in response to a question about additional restrictions on travel " from certain countries where they 're having more of a breakout . " 
Trump did not name which countries were coming under consideration for new restrictions , though the United States recently upped travel warnings for Italy and South Korea , where the virus has infected thousands . 
The United States has already restricted travel on people who have visited China and Iran . 
Speaking in the Cabinet Room , where he was meeting with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry , Trump said it was not yet necessary to declare a national emergency in response to coronavirus . 
He said it â€™s possible he could declare one in the future . 
In a news briefing , Vice President Mike Pence said anyone traveling to the United States on a flight from Italy and South Korea will receive multiple screenings before arriving in the United States . 
Pence also did not go into specifics as to which other countries were being considered but did mention the European Union , because a passport is not needed to travel among those countries and there have been some new cases there .
