At least 57 % of total confirmed cases in South Korea are related to the Shincheonji religious group 's Daegu branch , the head of the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) said in a Monday press briefing . 
Jung Eun Kyeong also explained why a high portion of women in their 20s and 30s caught the virus , saying it was due to the majority of Shincheonji members being women in that age group . 
KCDC was informed by the group that its leader , Lee Man hee , tested negative but no further details are known , according to Jung . 
The health authorities will review whether Lee ’s presser on Monday at one of Shincheonji 's facilities is a violation of quarantine act . 
This comes after the Seoul city government filed a legal complaint against Shincheonji ’s leader and the group ’s twelve regional leaders for charges including homicide .
