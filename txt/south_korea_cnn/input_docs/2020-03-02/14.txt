South Korea has come up with an innovative way of testing for the novel coronavirus : drive through coronavirus testing sites . 
Here 's how it works : In the northern city of Goyang , drivers pull in to a parking lot . 
They are met by health workers dressed in hazmat suits . 
Motorists then drive to several stations where nurses in protective plastic suits , masks and face shields register drivers . 
They also check their temperatures and use swabs to take samples from their throats and nasal passages . 
Officials say it is safer and faster to test for the virus at the drive through than in a hospital or health clinic . 
" There 's less face to face contact , " said Lee Jae joon , the mayor of Goyang . 
" If you operate a testing site indoors , there is concern that suspected patients can infect each other in the waiting room . "
