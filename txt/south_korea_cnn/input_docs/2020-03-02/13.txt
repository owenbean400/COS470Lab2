The founder and leader of Shincheonji religious group , which is at the center of the rapid rise in South Korean coronavirus cases , apologized " sincerely " to the country today at his first news conference since the nation 's outbreak . 
The group has faced mounting criticism after more than half of South Korea 's positive cases was linked to the group . 
At a press conference at one of Shincheonji 's facilities , called Peace Palace , in Gapyeong , Gyeonggi Province , Lee Man hee took a deep bow on his knees after issuing an apology to the public . 
" I apologize sincerely to the public for the outbreak related to the 31st confirmed case , " he added . 
Last night , Seoul City filed a legal complaint against Lee and the group ’s twelve regional leaders for charges including homicide . 
While he did not mention the Seoul City complaint today , the 88 year old said that the group 's leaders " are like parents for the members and what kind of parents would just wait and watch children dying ? " 
He denied accusations that he and his group have been hampering the health authorities ’ efforts to contain and prevent infections , adding that " this is not the time to scrutinize who ’s done right and who ’s done wrong . 
This is the time for everyone to do one ’s best for the people to resolve the situation . " 
When asked if he has kept to the self quarantine , he said that he was a busy person and has not been able to stay in one place . 
Korean health authorities are reviewing whether Lee ’s presser is a violation of quarantine act . 
South Korea has the most diagnosed cases of the virus — more than 4,200 cases and 26 deaths — outside of mainland China . 
As of Monday , at least 57 % of total confirmed cases in South Korea are related to Shincheonji , according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) .
