Kim Shin chang , the director of international missions for the Shincheonji religious group , told CNN Sunday that members had been fully transparent and cooperative with authorities in trying to contain the outbreak . 
Kim has denied responsibility for the recent spike in infections , saying authorities were trying to " exaggerate " its involvement to shift blame . 
Kim told CNN there were 357 Shincheonji members based in Wuhan .

CNN has reached out to KCDC for comment .
