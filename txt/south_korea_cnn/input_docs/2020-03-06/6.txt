South Korea ’s Foreign Ministry expressed " strong regret " today over travel restrictions Japan imposed yesterday . 
South Korea says it made repeated requests for Japan to review the situation before taking action , and had hoped Tokyo would have " sufficiently " consulted Seoul before making the decision . 
South Korea raised the idea that an ulterior motive was behind Japan ’s decision as it says its efforts to contain the coronavirus have been recognized by the international community . 
South Korea ’s National Security Council also held a meeting Friday to consider taking corresponding measures against Japan and called into question Japan ’s efforts to contain the virus , saying Tokyo had taken " unclear and passive measures . " 
The measures in place : Under the new travel restrictions , travelers from South Korea and China will be quarantined for two weeks upon arrival in Japan . 
Incoming arrivals from those two countries will be asked to stay in designated places and to refrain from using public transportation .
