South Korea ’s Blue House revealed on Thursday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a letter to his counterpart in South Korea in which he conveyed a " message of comfort " to the South Korean people as they struggle with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus . 
The exchange of personal letters comes at an interesting time for the two nations . 
Inter Korean diplomacy has failed to yield major developments since Moon and Kim ’s first historic summit in 2018 , and North Korea ’s rhetoric has gotten increasingly hostile toward the South . 
In fact , just days ago Kim Yo Jong -- Kim Jong Un ’s sister and the only member of the ruling family to visit South Korea -- likened Seoul to a " frightened dog barking " for expressing worries over North Korea ’s short range missile test on Monday .
