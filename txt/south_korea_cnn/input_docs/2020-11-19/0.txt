Quarantine for Americans is a much more difficult concept to grapple and come to terms with , compared to Asian countries such as China or South Korea , where there is a more entrenched infectious disease prevention policy . 
But should Americans feel like that ? 
After all , quarantines were strictly observed in Italy , New Zealand and Spain . 
Even Canadians are confounded as to why Americans seem to feel quarantine is a breach of civic freedom . 
Lambeth Hochwald , a New York City based writer and professor of journalism at New York University has spoken to a Singaporean and Canadian about how they view Americas reticence to quarantine . 
" What worries me looking at our good neighbors to the south is that the deep divisiveness that exists now seems to be mitigating against something we take for granted here , this common good , this belief that we 're all in this together . 
We 're each other 's neighbors , and it 's our obligation to not make somebody else ill if we can help it . "
