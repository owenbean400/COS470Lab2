As the US has lagged behind other advanced nations in testing for the coronavirus , former government officials and public health experts point to a series of policy and procedural decisions that they say hindered the nation 's response to the pandemic . 
South Korea had run more than 300,000 tests as of Friday , and while there is no official count of tests done in the United States , Dr . Deborah Birx , part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force , implied about 170,000 people have been tested so far . 
The US population is more than six times that of South Korea . 
For weeks public and private labs have raced to boost their testing capacity , but people across the country , even some with underlying health conditions , have told CNN this week that they have not been able to get tested . 
Asked Friday whether the US can currently meet demand for tests , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said , " We are not there yet . " 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's first test did not work Some context : In January , shortly after Chinese authorities identified a novel coronavirus as the cause of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan , the World Health Organization published a protocol with instructions for any country to manufacture tests for the virus Rather than using that protocol , the CDC developed its own test . 
A World Health Organization spokesperson said this week that the WHO did not offer tests to the CDC because the US agency typically has the capacity to manufacture them itself .
