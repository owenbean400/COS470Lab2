South Korea will send charter flights to evacuate citizens in Wuhan on Thursday morning local time , the government announced today . 
He also asked the public to understand the plight of the stranded citizens and welcome them home . 
The government estimated there are about 700 South Koreans in Wuhan who registered to return to South Korea . 
Only those showing no symptoms of the coronavirus will be allowed to board the flight , Kim said . 
Those who wish to take the flight will go through an inspection process by medical staff from Seoul before being allowed to board the plane , and will be responsible for the cost of the flight . 
When the flight arrives in South Korea , those citizens will then stay at two government provided facilities in Chungcheong Province for 14 days , to prevent possible infection from spreading . 
They will receive a medical check up twice a day .
