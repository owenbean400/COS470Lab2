South Korea has found four confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus so far , prompting medical teams to set up pop up testing facilities . 
At Seoul â€™s National Medical Center , where a coronavirus patient is being treated , a tent has been set up outside the hospital for testing -- so that potential virus patients wo not mix with other uninfected patients inside the building . 
Doctors at the hospital say they are concerned about the ability of the virus to mutate and spread , and anticipate treating a large number of potential patients in the coming days . 
Seven individual rooms have been prepared with a bed in each , waiting for potential patients to arrive . 
People who arrive to get tested are given a CT scan to detect viral pneumonia . 
A 55 year old South Korean man was brought in last Friday and confirmed with the virus after traveling from Wuhan . 
Doctors say he is stable , but the next week could be critical in stemming the spread of the virus .
