South Korea has confirmed 96 more coronavirus cases , bringing the national total to 7,478 , said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) today . 
South Korea has the most coronavirus cases outside of China , with more than half of all nationwide cases linked to the Shincheonji religious group in the country 's south . 
The numbers appear to be slowing : The KCDC and other emergency agencies said the weekend 's numbers appear to show a decrease in new cases per day . 
This could be because of the aggressive , widespread testing the country has implemented , as well as other measures like GPS quarantine monitors and smartphone apps for daily symptom reports . 
But it could also be other factors , like the possibility people just did not go get tested as much this weekend because of bad weather -- leading to a drop in numbers .
