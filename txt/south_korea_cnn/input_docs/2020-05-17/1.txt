South Korean schools will begin opening Wednesday , May 20 , for students in third year through high school , South Korea â€™s Vice Education Minister said during a briefing on Sunday . 
Public concern was raised about reopening of schools after a cluster infection was reported at nightclubs in Itaewon in the capital Seoul . 
As of Sunday , a total of 168 people have tested positive for the virus linked to the Itaewon cluster . 
The minister , Park Baeg beom , pointed out that many students are at a critical junction of their education , particularly those taking exams for job placement opportunities and students applying for arts and sports majors . 
All students and faculty members with temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius ( 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit ) or higher will not be allowed to go to school , the minister added . 
Temperature checks will happen twice a day and anyone with symptoms will be transported to centers . 
Why is this happening now : South Korea was among the first places to deal with a major coronavirus epidemic , and seemed to be on track to loosen restrictions , after weeks of social distancing measures and careful surveillance . 
But the new cluster raised questions as to whether restrictions should be eased . 
Before the latest cases , the number of new infections in South Korea had slowed to a trickle , with local transmission appearing to be halted . 
South Korea 's response has been hailed as one of the best globally , aided in part by the country 's relative small size , easily controlled borders and aggressive testing regime .
