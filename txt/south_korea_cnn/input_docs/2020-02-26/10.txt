An infected American soldier stationed in South Korea is being isolated in Camp Humphreys , a military base near the city of Pyeongtaek . 
When CNN drove to the base today , there was a long line of cars waiting to enter , snaking up the hill and around the corner out of view . 
Military personnel will be prohibited from participating in " non essential activities for entertainment , " which includes dining in restaurants , bars , clubs or movie theaters , said Garrison Commander Michael F . Tremblay earlier today . 
Military personnel are also asked to " stay away from gatherings larger than 20 people . " 
A member of the United States Forces Korea told CNN she drove to the base at 6 a.m . , waited for three hours , then gave up and went home . 
Only two of the six gates are open , so extra checks can take place . 
These measures include car screenings , with passengers having their temperatures taken and asked health related questions . 
Only mission essential staff will be on base tomorrow . 
The CNN team was not allowed into the base . 
When they went into the nearby side streets for lunch , many restaurants were closed or deserted . 
There was hardly anyone on the streets .
