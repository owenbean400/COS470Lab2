Scientists at Imperial College London estimate that around 4,000 people are likely to have been infected by the new coronavirus in Wuhan city alone as of January 18 . 
Official numbers show nine people have died and at least 479 have been infected by the outbreak , but a team at Imperial believes these numbers are a gross underestimate . 
Mild symptoms and delayed onset mean many cases are likely to have been undetected . 
The new estimates are more than double previous estimates the scientists released last week , which suggested 1,723 people were likely to have been infected by January 12 . 
The revision takes into account new information available this week , such as reports of exported cases in Thailand , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan and the United States .
