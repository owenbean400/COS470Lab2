Global equitable access to Covid 19 vaccines would generate estimated economic benefits of at least $ 153 billion in 2020-21 and $ 466 billion by 2025 in 10 major economies , a report by the Eurasia Group has found . 
The political risk consultancy analyzed 10 major economies -- Canada , France , Germany , Japan , Qatar , South Korea , Sweden , United Arab Emirates , United Kingdom and the United States -- to assess the economic benefits of contributing to the work of the Access to COVID 19 Tools ( ACT ) Accelerator . 
The ACT Accelerator , led by the World Health Organization , in partnership with other international health organizations , is a global collaboration which supports the development and equitable distribution of the tests , treatments and vaccines . 
The study determined that the ACT Accelerator program is " the only ‘ end to end ’ complete global solution -- across tests , treatments , and vaccines -- for tackling the pandemic . " 
It examined the expected negative effects of sustained coronavirus outbreaks in low - and lower middle income countries ( LLMICs ) , based on the downside and baseline scenarios of the IMF ’s October 2020 World Economic Outlook forecasts . 
" Rapid , widespread , and equitable vaccination , tests , and treatments will save countless lives in LLMICs , allowing policymakers ’ focus to return to the core development goals of raising living standards , empowering women , and marginalized communities , and strengthening institutions , " it said . 
The Eurasia Group report was commissioned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , a partner in the ACT Accelerator program alongside WHO , European Commission and France . 
To date , the 10 countries featured in the report have contributed $ 2.4 billion to the ACT Accelerator , with the UK committing just over $ 1 billion , and Germany , Canada , Japan and France committing $ 618 million , $ 290 million , $ 229 million and $ 147 million respectively . 
The program needs $ 38 billion in funding , of which $ 28.2 billion is still currently outstanding .
