Half a million students will sit South Korea 's notoriously difficult National College Entrance Exam on Thursday , a marathon day of tests that is the country 's answer to the SATs and can determine a teenager 's future . 
The tests are so significant that , in normal years , the country rolls out extreme measures to support students -- office hours are changed to clear roads to avoid students getting stuck in traffic and flights are rescheduled to prevent the sound of plane engines disrupting the English listening test .

Students will have their temperature checked before entering the testing facilities and will need to wear masks throughout the exam .
