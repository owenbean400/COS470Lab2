South Korea â€™s Shincheongji religious group says it " deeply regrets " the coronavirus outbreak that occurred in their Daegu branch that it is cooperating with local authorities . 
About half of the country 's 346 cases are linked to the Shincheongji group in the southern city of Daegu . 
On Saturday , South Korean health officials said that 9,300 members of the group will be tested and required to self isolate as they try to get on top of the outbreak . 
It also expressed concern over what it said was false information that has been circulating about the group . 
" The media had been reporting that we are the ' main culprit in the spread of virus ' , referring to our ' unusual service style ' , " the statement said . 
" A reality where we had to hold service on the floor to maximize the number of occupants in our small space -- which was due to Shincheonji not being allowed our rightful building permit , " the statement adds .
