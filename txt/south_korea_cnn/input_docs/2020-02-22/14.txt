More than half of South Korea 's novel coronavirus cases are linked to a branch of a controversial religious group in the southern city of Daegu . 
At least 231 of the country 's 433 confirmed cases are associated with the Shincheonji religious group , according to South Korea 's Centers for Disease Control & Prevention ( KCDC ) . 
The total number of cases reported in South Korea in the past 24 hours stands at 229 , after 142 new cases were confirmed overnight . 
Around 9,300 Shincheonji members are being put into self isolation and will be tested , the country 's Ministry of Health and Welfare said Saturday . 
The Shincheonji is centered around the personality of its founder and chairman , Lee Man hee . 
On a website believed to be the group 's official homepage , the group heavily suggests that Lee is the " Promised Pastor " mentioned in the Bible . 
The passage it highlights suggests that the Promised Pastor is the second coming of Jesus Christ . 
Members of the group congregate in a way that puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time . 
KCDC Director Jung Eun Kyeong said at a press briefing on Friday : " ( We are ) seeing that there is a possibility that the characteristics of many people sitting close together in a very confined space and holding service for more than an hour ... ( could have led to ) a few who were exposed infecting many ( other ) infectees . " 
The group said it " deeply regrets " the outbreak which occurred in their Daegu branch , in a statement released online Friday . 
It said its " services , gatherings , and mission activity " have been stopped and all its buildings are being sanitized .
