Schools in the greater Seoul area will suspend in person classes starting Wednesday due to a surge in coronavirus infections , according to the country 's education ministry . 
All kindergartens , elementary , middle , and high schools in the greater Seoul area will hold online classes until September 11 , Education Minister Yoo Eun hae announced in a news release on Tuesday . 
The measure will apply to schools in Seoul City , Incheon City and Gyeonggi Province , except students in their third year of high school . 
There are more than 7,500 schools in Seoul and its surrounding areas , according to the latest statistics by the Education Ministry from 2019 . 
The decision came after the Education Ministry and superintendents of the metropolitan area agreed that more preemptive and intensive measures were necessary to prevent further spread of infection . 
Some 150 students and 43 faculty members in the metropolitan area have tested positive since cluster infections in the area began on August 11 , the release said . 
Students normally go back to school at the beginning of March in South Korea , but the start of the spring semester was delayed this year due to the pandemic . 
South Korea began its phased return of students to the classroom in May .
