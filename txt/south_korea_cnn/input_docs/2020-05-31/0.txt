There have been 270 deaths in total . 
Some context : South Korea has used technology to help it contain the coronavirus pandemic through aggressive testing , contact tracing and quarantine measures , without ordering a widespread lockdown . 
After cases emerged linked to three venues in Seoul 's Itaewon nightlife district , city authorities tried to trace those who were potentially exposed . 
But they found that some clubgoers avoided calls or had given false details on the door , the mayor said . 
The city had to use phone signal tower records and credit card records instead to track some people down .
