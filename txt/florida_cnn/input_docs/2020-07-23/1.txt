Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that the Florida city will increase its penalties for people not adhering to its mask mandate , raising the amount from $ 50 to $ 100 for first and second offenses . 
Violators could face arrest for third offenses . 
Suarez said that 39 officers this week will be dedicated solely to mask enforcement . 
" We want to make sure that we 're able to continue these gains so that we do not have to take more dramatic measures , " he said . 
Suarez said the situation in Miami has improved , so he is not planning on implementing a stay at home order . 
" Just a few days ago , we were at 60 new cases per day . 
â€¦ We 're down to 20 new cases a day , which means that the remediation efforts that we 've taken , including the mask in public rule , are working , " Suarez said . 
" We 're being patient and letting those remediation efforts take full effect before making any decisions , " he added . 
Suarez said that delays in testing are leading to further coronavirus spread , particularly in large households , contradicting the President , who called testing " overrated . "
