At least 90 passengers are still onboard the Coral Princess after the cruise ship docked Saturday , according to Princess Cruises . 
New CDC guidelines , which require cruise travelers to fly on charter planes or take private transportation , are making it more difficult for those individuals to get home . 
The 90 passengers still onboard the Coral Princess are international guests who remain on the ship because of current travel restrictions , Princess Cruises said . 
They are awaiting clearance from their home countries , the cruise line told CNN . 
In response to CNN ’s request , Princess Cruises is looking into whether or not any Americans remain on the ship . 
Additionally , another 93,000 crew members remain at sea on 114 cruise ships that are in and around US waters , according to the US Coast Guard . 
Miami Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez expressed frustration with the new CDC guidelines during a virtual press conference , saying that these passengers and crew need to get off the ships and get home . 
Gimenez said he asked the cruise lines to allow crew members to go home and keep skeleton teams on the ships to minimize the risk of an outbreak . 
According to the US Coast Guard , the majority – about 90 – of the cruise ships with tens of thousands of crew members on board are in Miami ’s area of responsibility .
