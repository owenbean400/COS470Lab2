NBA commissioner Adam Silver today said the leagues ' fight to operate in a bubble amid a worsening pandemic in Florida is going well , but warned he is willing to end the season if he believes the virus poses a significant health risk to players or personnel . 
" No question , " replied Silver , when asked by CNN 's Wolf Blitzer if he 'd end the season if it was " the right thing to do . " 
" We have a panel of expert immunologists , infectious disease experts , public health experts and really they would make the decision frankly , " he said . 
" It would not be a business decision . " 
Silver also outlined the extensive measures the league has put in place inside its so called bubble in Orlando , Florida , saying there are nightly tests and players are expected to wear masks at all times except when they are on the court playing basketball . 
He also warned , however , the plan is not bulletproof . 
" We 're protected in essence from the high case rate around us but it 's not a hermetically sealed bubble of any kind ... [ But ] so far we 've been in there for roughy three weeks and we 've had zero cases , " he said .
