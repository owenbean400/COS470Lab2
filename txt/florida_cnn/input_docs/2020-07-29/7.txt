Rep . 
Francis Rooney , a retiring Florida Republican , became the first GOP House member to vote by proxy during the pandemic this afternoon . 
Rep . 
Don Beyer , a Virginia Democrat , cast Rooney ’s vote on a procedural matter for him . 
Some context : Republicans have attacked the proxy voting rules for months , saying members should have to be physically present to vote . 
Rooney had previously indicated he could make use of the remote voting provisions when he designated Beyer as his proxy , but he has not actually cast a vote by proxy until now . 
Beyer ’s communications director wrote that there were " audible gasps in the chamber " when Beyer cast Rooney ’s vote for him . 
The last time Rooney voted in the House was in February , according to his House website .
