Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis moved Miami Dade County into phase two of the reopening plan yesterday – and today Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber fired back in a scathing letter . 
Gelber blamed the state for failing to implement an " effective and sufficiently staffed contact tracing program " in Miami Dade County and for sending mixed messages regarding mask use . 
" As we reopen , our positivity rates are actually worse than they were the last time we reopened , " the letter said . 
" So the only way this does not become déjà vu all over again , is if we do something different . " 
Gelber urged De Santis to improve contact tracing , to consider using a digital contact tracing app and to mandate masks statewide . 
CNN has reached out to the governor ’s press office for comment .
