Sea World has laid off at least 1,896 employees , due to " significant and sustained " effects from the Covid 19 pandemic , Kyle Miller , Park President of Sea World Orlando said in a letter to the State of Florida . 
The letter is a requirement of employers in Florida , who must submit a WARN ( Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ) alerting local government when a mass layoff occurs . 
Sea World closed its parks on March 16 and within weeks had temporary furloughed the vast majority of its workforce . 
Though the parks reopened at a reduced operating and guest capacity in June , " self imposed limitations , consumer concerns and other factors " have made the recovery slow and have forced the company to make permanent the temporary furloughs . 
The layoff touches nearly all positions at Sea World , including waiters and waitresses , security officers , performers , sales clerks and photographers . 
" Sea World intends to accomplish this mass layoff with the least amount of disruption to the lives of its ambassadors and their families , and the Orlando community , " Miller said in the letter .
