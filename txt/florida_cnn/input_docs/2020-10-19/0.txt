Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber released a video this weekend accusing Florida Governor Ron De Santis of adopting the controversial practice of herd immunity as a strategy against the coronavirus . 
Gelber claimed that one day after De Santis held a roundtable discussion with Dr . Martin Kulldorff and Dr . Jay Bhattacharya -- two of the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration , which according to Gelber advocates for herd immunity -- De Santis decided to fully reopen his state . 
CNN reached out to Gov . 
De Santis â€™ press office and his communications director did not wish to comment .
