Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said " all options have to be on the table " when asked if he would consider implementing another stay at home order for the Florida city as Covid 19 cases rise . 
As of last night , the city of Miami is now mandating the wearing of face masks in public . 
Suarez said that he would recommend a mask mandate across the entire state . 
" Frankly , we really do not want to have to go backwards and undo some of the openings and potentially reimpose a stay at home order , " Suarez said . 
Florida has seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases over the past week , particularly among younger people . 
" The state is four times greater than the high water mark in March . 
… In Miami Dade County , we ’re twice as intense as we were in March , " Suarez said . 
The mayor , who tested positive for Covid 19 back in March , attributes the increase to complacency of some residents after the city reopened in late May . " People believed this thing was over , " he said .
