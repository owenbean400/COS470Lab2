Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said an increased positivity rate and expanded testing is creating the large new case counts that have been announced this week . 
De Santis said during a news conference Friday that the state is now seeing 45,000 new test results reported daily , up from 24,000 test results that were reported daily the last week of May . He attributed the high case count of nearly 9,000 reported Friday to a " test dump . " 
The majority of new cases are now people who are younger , with the median age ranging from 33 to 35 years old , De Santis said . 
He said the new cases are typically asymptomatic and primarily due to community transmission . 
De Santis told vulnerable populations to be vigilant and continue to avoid large crowds and other situations where transmission could be possible .
