The US Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Curativa Bay Corporation over its claims one of its products could protect against the novel coronavirus . 
The FDA said Friday the Clearwater , Florida , based company advertised its Advanced Hypochlorous Skin Spray on its Facebook page as something that could " provide a good extra line of protection against many things that we all fear today … # Kill bacteria and viruses … # Coronavirus . " 
The spray is a topical hypochlorous acid , an inorganic substance that can kill bacteria , but to sell a product in the US as a prevention or treatment for disease requires scientific evidence and well controlled human clinical studies . 
The FDA says there is no such support . 
The FDA said the company needs to take corrective actions immediately to ensure that it is not misleadingly representing its products as safe and effective for a Covid 19 related use , or it will face legal action . 
The FDA also said it was going to include the company on its list of firms that have received these warning letters for selling Covid 19 related products that are in violation of regulations . 
If the company takes corrective action , the FDA said it will remove it from its list .
