Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said he is not mandating masks statewide but will continue to provide guidance that people should social distance and use masks when that 's not possible . 
The governor said to make masks a mandate punishable by law could backfire . 
De Santis said that if local governments want to create an ordinance , it 's up to them . 
Businesses also have the right to ask customers to wear masks The governor said that some local sheriffs have said they wo not enforce it and there are parts of the state where a mandate would not make sense .
