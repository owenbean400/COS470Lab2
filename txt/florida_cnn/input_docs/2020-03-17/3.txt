Florida is barring groups of 10 or more people from beaches , Gov . 
Ron De Santis said today . 
This was in response to recent spring break crowds on beaches in the state . 
This follows US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines . 
The governor added that a six foot distance should be maintained between groups . 
While the decision on whether or not to close beaches is being left with local governments , De Santis says , " It 's our hope that these new restrictions will reduce the ability of folks to congregate in large numbers . "
