After Dr . Anthony Fauci said that new coronavirus hotspot Florida opened too soon , Gov . 
Ron De Santis said " there was no justification to not move forward . " 
De Santis defended the move to reopen , saying Florida had a " very low prevalence " of Covid 19 in May and early June , " particularly in the 64 counties outside of southern Florida . " 
" We did put southern Florida on a different pathway , " De Santis said at a Friday news conference in Orlando . 
De Santis said cases are on the rise in other parts of the country as well , not just Florida . 
Across the Sunbelt , " this is something that we 're dealing with , " said De Santis . 
The governor did not mention Florida 's 11,433 new positive cases reported today during the news conference . 
This marks the second time the state 's single day tally of cases topped more than 11,000 , according to CNN 's count . 
Florida health officials reported 11,458 cases on July 4 , according to CNN 's tally .
