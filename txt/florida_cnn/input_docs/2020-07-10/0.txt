Officials in Florida 's Miami Dade County reported a staggering 33.5 % Covid 19 positivity rate on Thursday , according to data released by Mayor Carlos Gimenez 's office . 
The positivity rate -- that is , the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested -- is tracked daily by the county . 
Gimenez 's office has said the goal is to not exceed a positivity rate of 10 % . 
The county has exceeded the 18 % mark for the past 14 days . 
The current 14 day average is 24 % , the data shows . 
Over the past 13 days , hospitalizations in Miami Dade County have gone up by 76 % , the number of ICU beds being used has increased by 86 % and the use of ventilators has soared by 124 % , according to the latest data from the county government . 
Some context : As more and more people are being tested , the focus is shifting to the positivity rate -- how many of those tested are actually infected . 
A lot of officials , including Gimenez , point to a rising positivity rate to counter arguments that the increase in case numbers is simply the result of more people being tested .
