The union representing about 750 Disney World performers in Florida blasted Disney on Friday , a day before the company reopens two of its Florida theme parks to the public . 
Some context : The comments are Actors ’ Equity Association ’s latest shot at Disney after filing a grievance against the company on Thursday . 
The grievance alleges Disney is punishing its members , who entertain guests as they walk around the park and also perform in live shows , for Actors ' Equity demanding coronavirus testing . 
The park is opening without their participation . 
In response to the grievance , Disney suggested another reason for reopening in Florida without Actors ’ Equity Association members . 
The company claims the actor ’s union " rejected " safety protocol and has not made itself available to continue negotiations . 
" Seven unions signed agreements to have their employees return to work , the Actors ’ Equity rejected our safety protocols and have not made themselves available to continue negotiations , which is unfortunate . 
We are exercising our right to open without Equity performers , " Disney spokesperson Stephanie Corzett said in a statement to CNN on Friday .
