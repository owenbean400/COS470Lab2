Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis , speaking at a news conference Friday , said the cost of " not giving kids an option to be able to have in person instruction is enormous . " 
De Santis said reopening schools " should not be a political issue , it should be based on the facts and if we see that this is very low risk , and we see , I think overwhelmingly , in every study that the school kids are not vectors of transmission . " 
Schools have opened in other parts of the world and " have not seen major problems but you can always have an outbreak , " said De Santis .
