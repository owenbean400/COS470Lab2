For the first time in more than two weeks , the US on Friday reported a slight decline in the number of people being treated in the hospital for coronavirus , according to the Coronavirus Tracking Project . 
However , it â€™s not clear if the data being reported was disrupted because of the Thanksgiving holiday , the CTP said . 
Some states and territories did not update their reports at all on Friday , including Delaware and Florida . 
Many others reported only incomplete data for the day . 
Organizations collecting data on coronavirus expected to see a dip for Thanksgiving and the following three to four days , with an increase in reported cases of diagnoses , hospitalizations and deaths expected on Tuesday , Wednesday and possibly beyond next week . 
Hospitalizations have been hitting steady records throughout November . 
The US surpassed 80,000 daily hospitalizations on Nov . 19 and set new records for 17 days straight until Friday , according to CTP .
