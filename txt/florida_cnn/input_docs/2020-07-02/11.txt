Miami , Florida , Mayor Francis Suarez said he is " extremely concerned " about the spread of coronavirus during the Fourth of July weekend if people do not take precautions . 
Suarez said the city has seen cases spike after big weekends like Memorial Day and high school and college graduations . 
He said the city is taking measures to prevent that from happening again . 
Suarez added that contact tracers have also found that the virus has been spreading from house parties . 
He said he agreed with Dr . Deborah Birx 's recommendation earlier today that all Florida residents who attended mass gatherings get tested â€“ even if they do not have symptoms . 
" I absolutely would urge them to do that . 
I think what happens often times is we 're seeing a lot , anecdotally , of one person getting sick and then the entire household gets sick , " he said . 
" I absolutely think that 's a very wise decision for everyone to get tested , " he added .
