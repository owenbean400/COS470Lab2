Mayors from coastal cities in Broward County , Florida , held a press conference to address beach closures over the July 4 weekend , as some people who are against the measures heckled the officials . 
The plans to close the beaches come as the number of new coronavirus cases in the county rapidly rise . 
" All the mayors of the coastal beaches are working collaboratively " to close the beaches because they " anticipate large crowds , perhaps even coming from other counties , " Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said at the presser Sunday . 
Beachgoers could be heard yelling " freedom , " " socialism , " " this is America , " and " do not shoot ! " 
Hallandale Beach Mayor Joy Cooper spoke briefly , at times yelling over the hecklers . 
" We would like them to understand that we are doing this to protect the public , " she said . 
" All we 're trying to do here today is just to assure everybody we 're doing this for the right reasons , " said Lauderdale by the Seas Mayor Christopher Vincent . 
Vincent said the officials want to avoid " the influx of about 10 times as many people " next weekend . 
Broward beaches will be closed from July 3-5 , the mayors said .
