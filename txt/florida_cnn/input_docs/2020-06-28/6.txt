South Florida , especially the Miamiâ€“area , has reported the most new cases in the state and it 's mostly due to socializing , Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said during a news briefing Sunday . 
The uptick in positive cases has been driven " by a big increase " over the last three weeks in younger age groups , particularly those in the 18 to 44 age range , De Santis said . 
Graduation parties and gatherings where people are not adhering to social distancing are responsible for several Covid 19 cases , De Santis said . 
A backlog of testing has also accounted for the current spike , De Santis said . 
Florida was in the 10 % positivity range when testing ramped up in March and April , De Santis said . 
In April , that rate dropped and was stable in May and June , at around 3 % . 
Positivity rate is about 12 % now , De Santis says .
