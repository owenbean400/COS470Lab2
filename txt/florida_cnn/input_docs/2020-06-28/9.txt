Drive through and walk up sites for coronavirus and antibody testing are still available at multiple sites throughout Florida , according to Mike Jachles , spokesman for the State Division of Emergency Management Covid test sites . 
During a Sunday press conference , Jachles said that wait times have been " considerably less " this weekend than what was seen last week . 
The testing site at the Hard Rock parking lot in Miami Gardens has surpassed 43,000 tests since the site opened at the end of March , Jachles said . 
It remains open from 9 a.m . to 5 p.m . seven days a week . 
There have been upticks in tests over the past week at the Miami Beach Convention Center , Jachles said . 
Jachles encouraged those that are both symptomatic and asymptomatic to get tested for the virus . 
About 1.8 million people have been tested statewide , according to Jachles . 
Antibody testing is also available at some sites , with results being given sometimes as soon as 20 minutes , Jachles said . 
Those tests are through blood draw . 
Jachles said that people planning on getting a test through a drive through site should be prepared to wait by having air conditioning in their car and a full tank of gas . 
If people ca not endure long waits , or if they are highly symptomatic , they should contact their health care provider or schedule an appointment at one of the sites that is taking appointments for testing , Jachles said . 
Jachles said there is no timetable for ending testing at these sites . 
" The word from the Division of Emergency Management is we 're committed to continuing this testing for as long as it 's needed . 
We have the division of emergency management , before the National Guard , dozens of nurses on site , committed , that have been here for many days working long days and will continue to conduct the testing , as long as it 's needed , " Jachels said .
