Miami Beach 's mayor has called for a special commission meeting on Monday to discuss mask usage compliance as Covid 19 cases continue to surge in Florida , according to a tweet from Mayor Dan Gelber . 
Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez has ordered all of the beaches in Miami Dade County to close for the July 4 weekend but residents in South Florida continue to congregate despite pleas from officials to social distance . 
In Pinecrest , an affluent Miami Dade suburb , the " largest problem is private house parties , " Mayor Joseph Corradino said in a letter to the community this week . 
House parties have become prevalent in recent weeks and " are the most dangerous things that impact our community , " Corradino said . 
" The law does not enable us to enforce the rules we use on public spaces on private property . 
So , our current option is to appeal to the common sense and decency of our citizens . 
This danger comes directly from within , " the letter said . 
Miami Beach code enforcement continues to enforce social distancing mandates from Miami Dade County , Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier told CNN . 
But , whether Miami Beach 's commission will discuss mandating face masks and imposing fines for violators like neighboring city of Miami , " it 's one theory , " Berthier said .
