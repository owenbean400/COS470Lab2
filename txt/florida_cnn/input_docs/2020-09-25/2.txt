Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis announced that he has signed an order moving the state into phase three of reopening at a news conference today . 
De Santis emphasized the impact the move will have on restaurants and bars , which can now operate at 100 % capacity . 
However , the order treats restaurants and bars differently in terms of what local municipalities can do to restrict operations . 
" If a local restricts between 50 and 100 , they 've got to provide the justification and they 've got to identify what the costs are involved with doing that are , " the governor added . 
Conversely , bars , which were operating at 50 % capacity , must be authorized to scale up to 100 % by local governments . 
" If you want to go beyond the 50 , you can authorize it and do it , " De Santis said . 
" We 're not telling you [ that ] you have to , but we 're not going to stand in the way of that , " he added . 
De Santis , in " an act of executive grace , " also suspended " all outstanding fines and penalties that have been applied against individuals " associated with pandemic related mandates , such as mask requirements . 
" I think we need to get away from trying to penalize people for social distancing , " De Santis said . 
" All these fines we 're going to hold in abeyance and hope that we can move forward in a way that 's more collaborative , " he added .
