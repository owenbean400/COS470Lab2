The president of Florida ’s largest teachers union , which is suing Gov . 
Ron De Santis over the state 's mandate to open schools , says that the state cannot be a " Petri dish " for the rest of the country . 
Florida ’s education commissioner issued an emergency order earlier this month , requiring all " brick and mortar schools " to open at least five days per week for all students . 
" There 's a risk that we do not know . 
… One life lost is one too many for a child who goes back to a multi generational home , " Ingram said . 
" It 's too early for us to find that out . 
And it 's too early for Florida to be the Petri dish for America , " he added . 
" We cannot experiment with our public schools . " 
Ingram said there is an open invitation for De Santis to sit down with the union and develop a comprehensive plan for schools .
