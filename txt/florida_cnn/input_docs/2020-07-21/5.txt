Martha Baker , a Florida nurse and head of a union that represents 5,000 health workers in the Jackson Health System in Miami , says that the ER at her hospital is getting " stressed to the max . " " We thought , perhaps that we had dampened the curve and then obviously [ this ] month we ’ve done nothing but continue to break records day after day , embarrassingly enough , " Baker told CNN ’s Brianna Keilar . 
" It ’s hard on our nurses . 
It ’s hard on all the caregivers inside the hospital . 
They need a break . 
It ’s been since March . 
People are near exhaustion and we ’re running out of beds , nurses and caregivers , " she added . 
Baker said that she is grateful for the additional 100 nurses that came down from across the country to help their stressed health system . 
They are asking for 100 more nurses now . 
She added that hospitals are having trouble distinguishing Covid 19 patients from non Covid 19 patients . 
" When I was talking to one of our physicians and he was saying , ‘ They ’re everywhere . 
The Covids are everywhere . ’ 
You come in for abdominal pain thinking , perhaps , it ’s your appendix and they test and you ’re Covid positive , " Baker said . 
" The patients in the hallways , Covid positive everywhere . 
It ’s hard to stay safe , " she added . 
The mixed messaging about safety and reopening protocols coming from state and local leaders is not helping . 
Baker said that caregivers are " getting angry " at leaders for not standing up for them . 
" I do not know how [ Florida Gov . Ron ] De Santis or other leaders in Florida or outside of Florida can ignore the science of this and it ’s really unfair to , not only the patients in our community , but to the caregivers inside of our hospital , " Baker said .
