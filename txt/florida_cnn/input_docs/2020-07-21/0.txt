There are currently 53 hospitals in Florida that have reached intensive care unity capacity and show zero ICU beds available , according to data released by the Agency for Health Care Administration ( AHCA ) early this morning . 
Eight of those hospitals are in Miami Dade County , the epicenter of the virus in the state . 
In the past two weeks , Miami Dade County has seen an increase in the number of Covid 19 patients being hospitalized ( 38 % ) , in the number of ICU beds being used ( 50 % ) and in the use of ventilators ( 67 % ) , according to the latest data released by Miami Dade County Government . 
Currently , 39 hospitals have asked the state of Florida for help with nurses , according to an email to CNN from the Florida State Emergency Operations Center . 
Jackson Health System in Miami has asked the state for an additional 275 medical staff , according to Jennifer Piedra , communications and outreach director at the health system . 
These medical professionals include 50 respiratory therapists , 100 nursing assistants and 125 nurses . 
Meanwhile , the Covid 19 positivity rate at the Jackson Health System was a staggering 38 % Sunday , the latest metric available , Piedra said . 
This rate includes all tests processed at the emergency department and tests conducted on inpatients and employees . 
In the past 10 days , 146 employees , including 49 nurses , have tested positive for Covid 19 , per Piedra . 
This equates to 1.1 % of the total workforce . 
So far , the state of Florida has provided Jackson Health with 125 nurses . 
If the new request to the state is met , that would bring the total medical staff provided to Jackson Health by the state of Florida to 400 .
