Younger people testing positive for Covid 19 at a higher rate is a " smoldering fire " that will hit vulnerable populations , said Erin Bromage , a CNN medical analyst and a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth . 
Bromage said health experts did not focus on younger people at the beginning of the pandemic because the priority was the older population and those with underlying health conditions who required hospitalization . 
" We 're now seeing what is really happening , which is those 18 - to 44 year olds are being affected at a really high rate . 
Their social networks , their employment , is allowing them to mix at a higher rate , and we 're seeing the infection rate – especially in Texas , Florida and Arizona – just skyrocketing in that demographic , " she said while speaking today on CNN ’s " New Day , " Bromage explained that while younger people with Covid 19 are not " as prone to severe disease as the elderly , " they will still put this population at risk .
