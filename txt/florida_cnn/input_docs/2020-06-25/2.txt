The US city of Houston could be the worst hit in the entire country if the current trajectory in Covid 19 cases continues as it has , a health expert has warned . 
Dr . Peter Hotez , the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine , said that new infection rates are also accelerating in Dallas , Austin and San Antonio , and that case numbers could rival those in Brazil . 
Hotez , who is also a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine is working on a potential Covid 19 vaccine . 
He said the models are showing that Houston could have a four fold increase in the number of daily cases by July 4 . 
Houston does have hospital bed capacity now , but Hotez said he is concerned about the future . 
" We have more room , but who wants to go there ? " 
Something is needed to stop community transmission , he said . 
On Thursday , Texas announced 5,551 new Covid 19 cases -- the state 's highest single day rise . 
Florida and California also reported their biggest single day increase in cases . 
Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott warned residents on Tuesday that because the spread of the novel coronavirus is so rampant right now the safest place for citizens to be is at home . 
He did not issue an official order to stay home . 
Reopening could have contributed : Hotez said the state was aggressive with social distancing at the start of the pandemic , which kept the number of cases down , but the state reopened at the end of April and right after Memorial day the number of cases started to rise . 
Hotez said the state did not put a " sufficient level " of public health infrastructure in place .
