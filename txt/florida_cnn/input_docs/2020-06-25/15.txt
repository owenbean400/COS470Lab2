Florida is seeing a significant resurgence in coronavirus cases , with more than 5,000 cases identified for the second day in a row . 
That could result in " catastrophic consequences " for the state if it has to shut down again , predicted Dr . Lilian Abbo , the chief of infection prevention at Jackson Health System in Miami . 
In Miami Dade County , health officials say 27 % of people getting coronavirus tests are testing positive . 
" It ’s a very concerning situation , " Abbo told CNN ’s Jake Tapper . 
Abbo said there could be several factors behind the resurgence . 
" We think that there are many reasons why it 's happening , but one of them is since we reopened the economy people have a false sense of security that the pandemic is under control , that perhaps this was made up by health care providers and the threat perhaps is not real . 
That , to us , is extremely concerning , " she said . 
This has to stop , Abbo said . 
" We cannot continue to see a continuous climb of cases because we do not want to have to go back to shutting down the economy . 
This will have catastrophic consequences for Miami Dade County and for the state and will definitely increase mortality , " she said . 
Hospitals are beginning to fill up with coronavirus cases , Abbo said . 
" When you start to see cases going up , that means that we 're going to start seeing hospitals running out of capacity to take care of patients that do not have Covid , and we do not want to go into that route . 
We want to be able to take care of everyone — those with Covid and those without . "
