Republican Sen . 
Marco Rubio said despite the uptick in cases in his home state of Florida , he does not think that there should be a statewide law mandating masks , questioning how that would be enforced . 
Asked if President Trump , who does not wear a mask , should push Americans to do so , Rubio said : " I do not know if that would matter at the end of the day for some people ... 
They just do not like being told what to do ... 
But we have to explain to people , it 's not about them . 
You 're doing it for somebody else . " 
Sen . 
Lindsey Graham , the South Carolina Republican , asked if Trump should encourage Americans to wear masks through his Twitter account , said : " Listen , I do not think he 's going to change where he 's at on masks . 
But he might , I do not know . " 
Asked about Trump not pushing Americans to wear masks , Graham said , " He 's got his own view of whether or not he should wear a mask but my advice to people is if you 're around strangers , try to stay six feet away , wear a mask . "
