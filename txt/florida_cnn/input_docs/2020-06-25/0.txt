Two passengers of the MS Zaandam cruise ship filed suit against Holland America and its parent company , Carnival Corporation , Wednesday . 
Leonard Lindsay and Carl Zehner , who are married , accuse the company of mishandling the Covid 19 outbreak onboard . 
They say it led to Zehner contracting the disease and being on a ventilator for three weeks . 
The attorneys are asking a federal judge to give the case class action status covering all of the passengers aboard the MS Zaandam . 
They claim Holland America did not follow through with promises to ensure the health of its passengers , who were allegedly not given a temperature screening at boarding . 
" Additionally , Defendants did not implement social distancing among the passengers , or implement other reasonable precautions at this stage of the cruise , " the lawsuit states . 
According to the suit , the ship was denied entry to a port in Argentina in March , but it was nearly a week before the crew began telling passengers to isolate in their staterooms . 
The plaintiffs claim the company was already aware that some of its crew members had become ill with coronavirus symptoms . 
It was not until April 3 that most passengers were allowed to disembark in Port Everglades , Florida . 
CNN has reached out to Holland America for a response to the lawsuit .
