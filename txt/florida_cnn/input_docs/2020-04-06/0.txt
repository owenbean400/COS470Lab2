The Coral Princess departed Santiago , Chile , on March 5 . 
Princess Cruises announced operations were halting one week later . 
On Saturday , Princess Cruises confirmed the ship arrived in Miami , Florida . 
The cruise line said Saturday that disembarkation of guests is expected to take several days due to limited flight availability and passengers " requiring shoreside medical care will be prioritized to disembark first . " 
Two passengers died on board the ship before it docked and six others were transported from the ship for treatment at local hospitals on Saturday , the release from Gimenez 's office said . 
Eight additional passengers were transported from the Coral Princess to local hospitals on Sunday , according to the release . 
Information on the condition of those patients is not known . 
The county is not able to clear passengers to leave the ship , the release said . 
Vessels are required to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard , to have their passengers offloaded , the release said .
