Authorities in Brevard County , Florida , say beaches will remain open for the Fourth of July holiday . 
Don Walker , spokesperson for the county , tells CNN that they are expecting a high number of people on their beaches . 
Walker says the county has 72 miles of shoreline which is ample space for people to safely socially distance . 
The county is recommending all beachgoers follow all social distancing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Walker says hotel bookings are down as they head into the holiday weekend which leads them to believe people are watching the numbers and are either opting to stay home or they 're making last minute plans based on their own " risk tolerance . " 
Brevard County officials are expected to meet later today to determine if they will issue a mandate for face masks , Walker said .
