Miami Beach , Florida , Mayor Dan Gelber said the city is implementing a face mask mandate today , in part because there " has not been a unity of purpose in the community . " 
The city still gets hundreds of thousands of visitors almost every day , Gelber said , and there will be civil penalties those those who do not comply . 
The mayor said Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis should make mask wearing mandatory , and it â€™s been a " problem " to get people to wear them . 
" There are people who think it 's a political statement to wear a mask , and it 's like an insult to the family and they 're fighting us about it , and I ca not imagine why that has become something right now , other than that , you know , the President has made it something , " Gelber said .
