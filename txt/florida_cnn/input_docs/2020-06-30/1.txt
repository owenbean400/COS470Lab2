There ’s no proof reclosing bars and night clubs and other businesses will slow the resurgence of coronavirus in parts of the United States , according to Dr . Peter Hotez , an infectious disease specialist and dean of the school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine . 
Many states such as Florida , Texas and Arizona are taking piecemeal steps on the local level in lieu of full lockdowns to try and flatten the curve again . 
Some cities and counties are mandating mask use while others are not . 
Hotez said they ’re trying to " have their cake and eat it , " too . 
Hotez also expects the thousands of new cases throughout the country will result in deaths over the upcoming weeks and he expects , once again , low income minority communities will fare the worst . 
" I 'm pretty convinced that most of these cases , or a lot of these cases and deaths that will follow them over the next three weeks are happening in low income neighborhoods , so African American populations , Hispanic , Latinx populations , Native American populations , " Hotez said .
