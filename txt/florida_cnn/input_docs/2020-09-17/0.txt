Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber says that President Trump is spreading misinformation about coronavirus — and that is " lethal . " 
" Without a vaccine , good information is your vaccine . 
Misinformation , wrong information , withholding of information just becomes lethal , " Gelber said on CNN ’s " New Day . " 
Gelber said that 39 people died from Covid 19 yesterday in Miami Dade County . 
He said he worries about both residents and visitors not following guidelines as the pandemic continues . 
" If all we 're going to do is the same thing and the President is going to mock people who wear masks and have events where everybody is not wearing a mask , so that I have residents and visitors who say , ‘ Why should I wear a mask ? 
You ’re an idiot , ’ " he added . 
Gelber continued to press Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis to implement a statewide mask mandate . 
" We ’re not in as good as shape as we were . 
We were at 2%…before we reopened last time ; now we 're at 4 to 5 % , " he said about the coronavirus infection rate .
