Florida is set to become a new center of coronavirus spread and that ’s a tragedy , an infectious disease specialist from Florida International University said Thursday . 
" We have just spent so much time and effort and suffering hammering down the original outbreak that it ’s really a tragedy to see the numbers start to go back up , " Dr . Aileen Marty told CNN ’s Erin Burnett . 
" We have public health measures that can be used to get it back down without having a lockdown if the community cooperates , " Marty said . 
Those measures include wearing a mask in public and maintaining social distancing . 
Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis , though , has said the spike in cases in Florida is a result of increased testing and clusters of the illness in places such as prisons and long term care facilities . 
Marty said those communities are a very small part of the overall picture of the disease in the state . 
" If it 's any reflection of what 's going on it 's a very small part of the picture and the reality remains that there are more hospitalizations happening here right now so we know this is a real increase in cases , " she said .
