More than 90 % of Americans are still susceptible to Covid 19 , said Dr . Ali Khan , dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center . 
When asked about the uptick in new coronavirus cases in states like Florida and Texas , Khan said the US will continue to see increases if states do not open safely . 
" We 're in the midst of the greatest public health failure in American history , and if we 're going to continue to open up and not open up safely , we 're going to continue to see increased cases , " Khan told CNN .
