Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Giménez announced during a virtual news conference on Tuesday that restaurants can resume indoor dining at 50 % capacity starting Monday . 
Giménez said that this announcement comes " after consultation with our medical advisors and also from the White House Task Force . " 
Some of the requirements will include a maximum of six people per sitting area and six feet of space between tables , Giménez said . 
Earlier on Tuesday , Carlos Hernández , the mayor of the city of Hialeah , Florida , told CNN over the phone that he directed his departments not to enforce the county 's previous order . 
In a video shared on his Facebook page Tuesday , Mayor Hernández said " I am asking my city employees , my departments , that we will not be enforcing in the City of Hialeah the regulations of restaurants being closed . 
The county can come and do that . 
Now I 'm not going to ask these businesses or tell any business to do it , to open or not . 
But what I 'm saying is , Hialeah cannot be part of this any longer . " 
Mayor Giménez responded to Mayor Hernández 's comments . 
" These are county rules , and if the Hialeah Mayor decides that his police force is not going to be enforcing the county rules , the county will be enforcing the county rules , because the county has jurisdiction everywhere , " Giménez said . 
He went on to say " the opening is not allowed until Monday . 
So if restaurants in Hialeah open up before Monday , they may well find a Miami Dade County police officer there to give them a fine for violating the county rules . "
