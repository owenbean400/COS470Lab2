The NBA 's Board of Governors have voted to restart the suspended 2019-2020 season with 22 of the league ’s 30 teams taking part . 
The decision will now be considered by the players union who need to approve the plan . 
The new schedule will see training camps open the first half of July with a tentative resumption of the regular season on July 31 . 
The NBA says the season restart is contingent on a deal made to utilize the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando , Florida , as an isolated campus to hold all games , practices and residency . 
In a statement , NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said , " The Board ’s approval of the restart format is a necessary step toward resuming the NBA season . 
While the COVID 19 pandemic presents formidable challenges , we are hopeful of finishing the season in a safe and responsible manner based on strict protocols now being finalized with public health officials and medical experts . 
We also recognize that as we prepare to resume play , our society is reeling from recent tragedies of racial violence and injustice , and we will continue to work closely with our teams and players to use our collective resources and influence to address these issues in very real and concrete ways . "
