Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis and White House Coronavirus advisor Scott Atlas discouraged testing individuals with no coronavirus symptoms at a Monday roundtable event in Tallahassee , Florida . 
This comes after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised testing guidelines last week . 
The new recommendations suggest asymptomatic people may not need to be tested for Covid 19 , even if they 've been in close contact with an infected person . 
But , some experts are still concerned about asymptomatic spread . 
Last week , Dr . Anthony Fauci told CNN " I am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern . 
In fact it is . " 
Atlas said that although asymptomatic spread can occur , symptomatic individuals are " super spreaders " of the virus .
