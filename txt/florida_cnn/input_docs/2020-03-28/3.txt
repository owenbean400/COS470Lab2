Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis says questions about his decision to not to issue a statewide mandate closing Florida 's beaches during spring break is " more of a political issue . " 
The New York City subway is being " packed like sardines , " but a family sitting outside in " sunshine , heat and humidity , that 's not as big as a problem , " De Santis said . 
De Santis says he did impose " 10 person limit " for groups and local officials maintained limited access to beaches for residents . 
Several Florida beaches were closed by local officials in Miami Dade , Palm Beach , Martin , St . Lucie and Indian River counties . 
On Friday , De Santis said he 's suspending vacation rentals in Florida for the next two weeks and is planning to extend an executive order to require travelers coming from Louisiana to Florida to do a mandatory 14 day self quarantine or isolation period . 
The order currently applies to travelers coming to Florida from airports in New York , New Jersey and Connecticut .
