President Trump said he is thinking about a possible " short term , two week " quarantine for " New York , probably New Jersey and certain parts of Connecticut . " 
Speaking at the White House , Trump said " we might not have to do it , but there ’s a possibility sometime today " he will enact a quarantine . 
Trump said that this would be an " enforceable quarantine , " one that would restrict travel because New Yorkers have been traveling to Florida and " we do not want that . " 
Trump said he would rather not do it , " but we may need it . " 
Later at Joint Base Andrews , Trump also said such an action was a possibility . 
" We ’re looking at it , " he said on a possible quarantine . 
When asked about closing the New York City subway Trump said , " No we would not do that . "
