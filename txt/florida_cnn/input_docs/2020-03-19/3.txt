Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said he issued an order Thursday morning to limit gatherings on beaches to no more than 10 . 
" So what you 've see now is a lot of the sheriff 's departments have instituted protocols … Cocoa Beach , major spring break destination went down 70 % since my order . 
And so , I think that 's a more prudent approach to do social distancing , " the Republican governor said . 
The governor also wants Spring Break vacationers to know that the party is over . 
" Since I issued my directive , anybody who 's put that in place , spring break ’s done . 
Any place to go for bars and all this done . 
They do not have a place to go . " 
De Santis added that he spoke to the US surgeon general recently about social distancing . 
He does not want people living in the Sunshine State to stay inside all day if they feel fine .
