While Florida has ordered schools to reopen despite the rise in Covid 19 cases , Jimbo Jackson , principal of Fort Braden School in Tallahassee is urging parents to opt for virtual learning for their kids . 
" I think our greatest concern is the safety of our staff and our students and our connected school families . 
With our recent state mandate to have face to face and brick and mortar learning , we have extreme concerns , " he explained . 
The school lost two active staff members of the school along with a relative of a staff member and a former employee to coronavirus , according to Jackson . 
Pointing to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for reopening schools and a high positivity rate among children under 18 that indicates high risk , Jackson says in person instruction could pose health risks . 
Jackson and his wife also contracted coronavirus in July , which has made him more aware of his role , he said . 
Schools are a fundamentally social experience and children as young as four or five year old kindergarten students will have to be re trained to not socialize , Jackson emphasized about in person experience . 
" To not have tag games or to not borrow supplies from each other , those are things that become really difficult to mitigate in a school social setting , " he said . 
" It will be a very difficult challenge . "
