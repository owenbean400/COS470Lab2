After issuing a stay at home executive order on Wednesday , Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis signed another executive order today that overrides any conflicting orders put in place by local governments . 
It 's an about face for the governor . 
Earlier in the Covid 19 crisis , when he was criticized for not closing the state â€™s beaches , the governor said the move was because he wanted cities and counties to make their own decisions . 
Desantis said at a Thursday news briefing that he did not believe the government had the authority to close church . 
Remember : Hillsborough County is one of the local governments affected by De Santis ' superseding order . 
The county enacted its own order limiting social gatherings to ten or fewer people . 
The county sheriff arrested popular pastor Rodney Howard Browne for continuing to hold large church services in violation of the order . 
But the state 's new stay at home order includes " attending religious services conducted in churches , synagogues and house of worship " as essential activities . 
The stay at home order starts Friday and will expire on April 30 .
