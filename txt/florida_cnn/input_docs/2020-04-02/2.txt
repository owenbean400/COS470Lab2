As two cruise ships are set to arrive off the Florida coast today , Florida Democratic Rep . 
Donna Shalala said it ’s " immoral not to let them come . " 
Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said the state is going to accept Florida residents on board the ships , but expressed concerns about taking in others given the state 's limited hospital beds . 
" We Americans do not turn people away , " Shalala said . 
" I do not care whether they ’re Florida residents or whether they ’re not — they ’re human beings . " 
More than 200 guests and crew have flu like symptoms on the ships , including eight passengers who tested positive for Covid 19 . 
It 's not clear whether passengers will be allowed to disembark . 
Four people on one of the ships , the Zaandam , have died since it disembarked from Argentina on March 7 . 
Shalala also said that De Santis ’s delay in issuing a statewide stay at home order cost lives in Florida . 
Shalala is still critical of the order — which exempts religious services conducted in house of worship . 
" He ’s fine tuned the decision in a way in which people are still going to be exposed , " she said .
