When Antionette Brown first saw Henry Bell at a nightclub 14 years ago , she knew he was the one . 
Although they never married , they commonly referred to each other as husband and wife during that span . 
Nothing tore them apart -- not even when Bell nearly died after being hospitalized with Covid 19 for nearly two months . 
So one day before he was released from HCA Healthcare 's Orange Park Medical Center in Florida , they finally decided to tie the knot in the hospital parking lot surrounded by the health care workers who helped save Bell 's life . 
A difficult journey : Bell arrived at the hospital on September 13 after experiencing coronavirus symptoms and was immediately placed on a ventilator . 
After weeks in the ICU , Brown was forced to decide between placing Bell in a hospice or giving him a tracheostomy , a procedure that involves creating an opening in the neck to place a tube into a person 's windpipe so they can breathe . 
When doctors momentarily stopped sedating him so he could help make the decision by squeezing once for a tracheostomy or twice for no , Bell says he did not have to think about it for a second . 
" There was no decision to make , " Bell , 63 , told CNN . 
" I wanted to live . 
I chose life . " 
Bell says he was sedated for most of the time he was in the hospital . 
He has no recollection of what happened or what he went through . 
But he does remember that the moment he woke up , he wanted to make Brown his wife . 
The couple married on November 5 . 
Doctors and nurses helped Bell get to the alter , where he was able to stand for the longest time since being hospitalized .
