Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said Monday he is issuing an executive order that calls for a mandatory 14 day self isolation for travelers coming from airports in New York and New Jersey . 
" Today there ’s over 190 direct flights from the New York City area to the state of Florida , and I would reckon , given the outbreak there , that every single flight has somebody on it who ’s positive for Covid 19 , " De Santis said at a news conference . 
There are at least 1,171 cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths in Florida , according to CNN Health ’s tally of US cases . 
De Santis said travelers will be met by local or state law enforcement , as well as personnel from the Florida Department of Health . 
Passengers will also be subject to temperature checks , De Santis said . 
Passengers planning to stay with family in Florida would not be exempt from the order . 
De Santis said the order " will go out today . " 
The governor said he believes New York State ’s shelter in place order may have contributed a surge in visitors to his state .
