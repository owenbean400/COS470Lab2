Seamas Hunt is closing down his Florida bar once again due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Hunt , who is co owner of Paddy O ’Leary ’s Irish Pub on Pensacola Beach , said the news of people getting sick inspired him to " be proactive . " 
He also feels like the order from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation suspending on premise alcohol consumption has unfairly targeted bars , Hunt told CNN today . 
Paddy O ’Leary ’s Irish Pub will now offer to go drinks only . 
Some context : At least 64 counties in Florida were in phase two of reopening , which allowed restaurants , bars , and other vendors licensed to sell alcoholic beverages , with the exception of nightclubs , to operate bars .
