New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo has launched a health department investigation into the potential exposure of Covid 19 at a high school graduation in Westchester County after an individual who recently went to Florida attended and subsequently began exhibiting symptoms . 
That individual , and four more who attended the ceremony and had contact with the person , have tested positive for the virus , a news release from the governor 's office said . 
Horace Greeley High School held a drive in graduation ceremony on June 20 at Chappaqua Train Station in Westchester County , according to the news release . 
All individuals who tested positive are currently self isolating , the governor said . 
In addition to the graduation , the student who tested positive for Covid 19 also attended a non school related field night event with other junior and senior students . 
The health department is asking everyone who attended those events to get tested and to extend their quarantine period until July 5 . 
The governor has now asked the State Department of Health to investigate and trace the exposure at the high school graduation and the field night , the release said . 
CNN has reached out to the school for comment . 
Some context : This news comes after New York , New Jersey and Connecticut issued a travel advisory Wednesday that requires people arriving from states with high coronavirus rates – including Florida – to quarantine for 14 days . 
Subsequently , Cuomo issued a fresh executive order on Saturday that makes state employees who voluntarily travel to high risk states after June 25 ineligible for Covid 19 paid sick leave .
