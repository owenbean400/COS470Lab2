Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he is concerned about the rising percentage of coronavirus cases in the region . 
Gimenez said they are seeing a spike in the 18 to 34 and 35 to 44 age groups . 
Miami Dade beaches are closing on the July 4 weekend as a pro active measure to prevent " a spike on top of a spike " in positive coronavirus cases , the mayor said . 
" Here in Miami Dade we expected huge crowds to be at the beach , it would have been very hard for us to control our social distancing and having people abide by the rules , " Gimenez said . 
Statewide numbers : Florida health officials reported at least 9,585 new coronavirus cases on Saturday , according to the Florida Department of Health . 
This is the highest single day increase the state has seen since the start of the pandemic .
