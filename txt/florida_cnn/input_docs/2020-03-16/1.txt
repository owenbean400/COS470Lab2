Republican Sen . 
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a tweet that he has tested negative for coronavirus . 
Graham has been under self quarantine after potentially coming into contact with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro ’s spokesman , Fabio Wajngarten , who did test positive for the virus . 
It ’s unclear how Graham was able to be tested as testing shortages abound across the country and the CDC only recommends those who are exhibiting symptoms to be tested . 
GOP Rep . 
Matt Gaetz of Florida also received a test for the virus , without showing any symptoms , after he came into contact with someone who did test positive after attending the Conservative Political Action Conference and later interacted with President Donald Trump .
