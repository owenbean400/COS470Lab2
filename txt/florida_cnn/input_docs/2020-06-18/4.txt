Covid 19 hot spots are growing in the south and southwest regions of the United States , Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said during an appearance on " Morning Joe " Thursday . 
" Certainly in the states where you have not seen as much infection to date , that were not as hard hit , I think there ’s more complacency and there ’s higher risk of spread . 
I think that ’s what ’s happening in the south and the southwest , " Gottlieb continued . 
" There are parts of the country right now that have full blown outbreaks underway . 
When you look at what ’s happening in parts of Florida ; parts of Texas , Houston and the Austin area ; when you look at what ’s happening in Arizona as well , Alabama , South Carolina — those are outbreaks " Gottlieb added that " we have a lot of persistent infection in this country ; we ’re diagnosing 20,000 cases a day , " and he said that targeted measures , such as limiting the capacity of bars to 50 % or less , would be needed to help curb outbreaks . 
" We ’re not really implementing the kind of tough measures , targeted measures , that can get those outbreaks under control yet , " Gottlieb said .
