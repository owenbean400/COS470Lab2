States need to figure how to protect people from Covid 19 while still continuing to reopen economically , Dr . Colleen Kraft , associate chief medical officer at Emory University Hospital , said on CNN today . 
Kraft said she does not think the US " can survive another shelter in place economically " when asked about the uptick in new coronavirus cases in places like Florida . 
Kraft urged people to wear masks and carry hand sanitizers in an effort to reduce transmissions , despite claims from President Trump that the virus " is dying out . " 
" Please understand that you have within your abilities to make a difference and diminish transmission . 
Wearing a mask or not wearing a mask should not be how you 're going to vote in the upcoming election . 
It 's really about protecting yourself from an infection , " she said .
