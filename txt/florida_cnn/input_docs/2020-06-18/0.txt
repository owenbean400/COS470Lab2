Florida has " all the markings of the next large epicenter " of coronavirus transmission , with the risk being the " worst it has ever been " according to new projections . 
The other areas of concern for additional widespread community transmission include the Carolinas , Texas , and Arizona . 
The model was put together by a team of scientists at the Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania . 
The version of this model used local data from 517 counties with active outbreaks to provide short term forecasts of where Covid 19 cases would be . 
Florida ’s Republican Gov . 
Ron De Santis has attributed the recent spike in cases in his state to aggressive testing and blames outbreaks in prisons , agricultural communities and long term care facilities . 
Experts said the numbers of new infections are definitely increasing and it ’s not just because there ’s more testing . 
Miami and some of Florida ’s southeastern counties , along with the Tampa and Fort Myers area and Orlando can expect to see a widespread transmission event and case numbers will likely then rise in the rest of the state , according to the model . 
It also predicts problem spots for vacation areas like Galveston , Texas and Lake Charles , Louisiana . 
Bright spots : Despite reopening early , one bright spot in the model includes Atlanta and much of Georgia , which seem to have kept cases in check . 
The Midwest and Northeast , which have remained in lockdown longer than other areas of the country , also are predicted to see a decline in case counts through July .
