Connecticut Gov . 
Ned Lamont pushed for schools to reopen for in person learning during a news conference Tuesday , saying he knows the state can bring students back safely . 
" If Connecticut ca not get their kids back into the classroom safely , no state can , " the governor said , citing the state 's hard work in wearing masks and social distancing . 
Lamont appeared alongside Connecticut Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona and other educators from the Winchester school district , which is offering full in person learning to students when the school year starts August 31 . 
There is an option for full remote learning for those families who choose it . 
Lamont said he believes students can be brought back safely based on the current public health conditions in the state . 
" I would not be opening my school in southern Florida . 
I would not be opening school in Texas or Phoenix or South Central LA . 
But I would do it in Connecticut . 
I would do it right here , " Lamont said . 
Winchester Schools Superintendent Melony Brady Shanley said most parents want their children to return for in person classes , based on the results of a survey the district conducted . 
According to Brady Shanley , 76 % of families are opting for in person learning , 22 % for temporary distance learning and 2 % for homeschooling . 
" We expect that education is going to look different . 
However , different is not necessarily a negative , " Brady Shanley said . 
" [ Kids ] need and benefit from in person instruction . "
