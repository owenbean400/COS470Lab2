And his rally in Oklahoma on Saturday night was a rebuke of the notion of social distancing -- even though , ironically , his smaller than expected crowd would have made such practices possible . 
Cases spike : Health experts warn that spikes in infections in states like Florida and Arizona -- both of which recorded new highs in daily infection rates over the weekend -- are being driven by the public 's waning willingness to avoid large gatherings and a reticence to wear masks . 
Long term threat : The President 's poor example represents a typical effort to divide Americans and highlight divisions over specific issues for his own political gain .
