The Diamond Princess cruise ship has been docked off the coast of Yokohama , Japan , now since February 4 , and quarantined passengers aboard the ship say they feel like they 're in prison . 
At least three more passengers have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus , according to a statement released by the Japanese Ministry of Health on Saturday , bringing the total number of cases on the ship to 64 . 
More than 2,600 passengers on the ship are in enclosed rooms with no balconies . 
Passengers can only go outside in small groups under close supervision for less than an hour a day . 
CNN 's Will Ripley spoke to some American passengers aboard the ship , one of whom is calling on the US government to intervene and get them out of what she called a " contaminated prison . " 
" This is not a safe environment and we do not think anybody , let alone the Japanese government , wants to be responsible for making a bad decision of quarantining us in an unsafe place , " said Florida resident Gay Courter . 
" We want off this ship and we want to go in health and not in dire medical circumstances . " 
Rebecca Frasure , an Oregon resident whose throat swab tested positive for the coronavirus , said she had no symptoms and was scared of the unknown . 
" I do not know what 's going to happen an hour from now , tomorrow . 
For all we know we could stay on this ship for months , " she said .
