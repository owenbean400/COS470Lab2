Gatherings of large groups are beginning to happen again in the US but they may not look the way they once did and experts question if the public is ready for them at all . 
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said teams may open their facilities as soon as Tuesday â€” so long as it is permitted in their state and teams follow staffing restrictions . 
Players and coaches , however , wo not start to return until next month . 
In North Dakota , large gatherings like concerts , weddings , carnivals and graduations will soon be allowed to resume , with adherence to new guidelines , Gov . 
Doug Burgum announced Friday . 
Those guidelines include contactless payment , two seats in between patrons and disinfection between uses of equipment . 
Florida amusement parks , like Walt Disney World , may soon be opening their doors as well . 
Gov . 
Ron De Santis signed an executive order allowing counties to enter phase one of reopening and parks to submit re opening proposals . 
As those reopening plans continue , the 12 forecasting models tracked by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are predicting an increase in deaths in the coming weeks that could bring the nationwide death toll to 100,000 by June 1 . 
Currently , more than 1.4 million coronavirus cases and 87,000 deaths have been reported in the US .
