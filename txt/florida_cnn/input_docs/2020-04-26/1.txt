Physicians at Orlando Health have used convalescent plasma transplants in 12 patients and are seeing " drastic improvements " in at least two of those patients , Dr . Sunil Desai said in a press conference Sunday afternoon with Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis . 
The process , known as plasma derived therapy or convalescent plasma , involves doctors testing the plasma of people who recovered for antibodies to the virus and then injecting that plasma , or a derivative of it , into a sick person . 
Plasma from recovered Covid 19 patients have been given to 12 patients in the health system , Desai said , and he has direct knowledge of two patients showing drastic improvements . 
Physicians are asking every patient who has tested positive to donate plasma , Desai said . 
The hospital began doing the convalescent plasma transplants two weeks ago to help treat Covid 19 . 
Orlando Health officials said that cases in their area peaked April 1 . 
Their hospitalization peak was at 116 patients on April 7 . 
They currently have 68 .
