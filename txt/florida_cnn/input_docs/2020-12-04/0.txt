Over the course of two months , the coronavirus positivity rate in Florida 's Miami Dade County has spiked 91 % , according to the county 's Chief Medical Officer Peter Paige . 
During a roundtable discussion on Friday , Paige said overall numbers in the county continue heading in the wrong direction . 
Paige said the county is currently at 9.77 % positivity for the number of coronavirus infections in comparison to two months ago where the positivity rate was 5.11 % . 
Paige says hospitalizations have also spiked 139 % over the last 60 days . 
As of Thursday , there are 815 patients hospitalized due to Covid 19 in comparison to two months ago where there were only 341 covid 19 patients , Paige said . 
Intensive care unit rates have also jumped 58 % in the last two months , Paige said . 
" This is particularly concerning considering we really do not know that the most challenging days may still be ahead of us , " Paige said . 
Paige said it 's even more critical at this point to prepare for the future and is urging people to follow strict Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to help slow the spread of the virus . 
Remember : The positivity rate is not a measure of how many cases there are , it is the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that show someone has Covid 19 .
