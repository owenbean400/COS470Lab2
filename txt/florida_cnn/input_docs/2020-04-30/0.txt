Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said Wednesday a report that Florida officials put a stop to releasing a list of coronavirus deaths to the public " does not make sense . " 
According to the Tampa Bay Times , the Florida Department of Health intervened to keep a tally of coronavirus deaths kept by Florida ’s 22 medical examiners from being released publicly . 
The Miami mayor said it was the first time he heard of the report . 
Suarez also said he was unsure when he would reopen his city . 
He also told Burnett that he supports Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis ’ decision to exclude three of the counties hit hardest by coronavirus from his May 4 reopening plan . 
Dr . Stephen Nelson -- the chairman of the state Medical Examiners Commission , the group that release the list of deaths -- said state officials told him they plan to remove cause of death and case descriptions from death counts , a move he said would render the information " meaningless , " according to the newspaper . 
Burnett asked if Suarez was concerned with what appears to be an effort to recategorize coronavirus deaths .
