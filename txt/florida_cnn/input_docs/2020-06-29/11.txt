Miami Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez said the reopening of beaches is not the reason for the spike in coronavirus cases in South Florida — it 's " younger people basically disregarding the rules . " 
The mayor said he is closing the beaches for Fourth of July weekend to avoid the surge of people who are thinking about coming to the beach for the holiday . 
" I was afraid , though , of a surge of people coming in for the Fourth of July weekend , and our inability , possible inability to control that . 
That 's why we closed the beaches for the Fourth of July , " Giménez said . 
The beach closures come as Florida is among at least 10 states seeing a 50 % or more increase in Covid 19 cases compared to the previous week .
