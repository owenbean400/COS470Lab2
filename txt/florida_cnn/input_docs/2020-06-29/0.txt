White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said Sunday there is " scientific evidence that masks both keep you from infecting others but may also partially protect you from getting infected . " 
Officials have mentioned this possibility before , but it has not been a point of emphasis for the administration ’s health experts in their public comments . 
Birx travelled to Dallas with Vice President Mike Pence to talk with state officials about why they believe they have seen a major spike in Covid 19 cases in the last two weeks . 
Birx said she was there to encourage younger people to wear masks , " and if they ’re interacting with their parents and grandparents , they should wear a mask then too because we know now how many of them are asymptomatic . " 
Birx thanked Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott for his decision to close bars and appealed to every Texan to wear a mask , though there is no statewide requirement for their use in public . 
The US Food and Drug Administration ’s guidance on personal protective equipment says that while masks may be effective in blocking splashes and large particle droplets , a face mask , by design , does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs or sneezes . 
Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the mask and your face . 
Birx is expected to travel this week to several other states experiencing spikes , including Florida and Arizona .
