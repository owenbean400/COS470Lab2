A trauma physician at Miami 's Jackson Memorial Hospital told CNN the hospital 's ICU is beginning to fill up just as they are being told there 's a supply shortage to treat coronavirus . 
The trauma physician said the presence of coronavirus created a thick layer of fog they have to operate in as they try and treat patients . 
" It â€™s not like in the ICU , " the physician said . 
" Everybody knows the patient has COVID and has time to don the equipment before going into the room . " 
Normally they rely on literature , research and training in the trauma center , developed over years of study and practice . 
But the physician says they are " flying blind " in a storm without instruments right now . 
" With COVID and trauma there is nothing , " the physician said . 
" So , we had to build guidelines from the ground up in record time and start training our teams on those guidelines not really knowing if they are best practices or not . " 
Jackson Memorial Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in the US with 1,550 licensed beds . 
It 's the biggest hospital in the state of Florida and holds the Ryder Trauma Center , Miami Dade County 's only adult and pediatric Level 1 trauma center .
