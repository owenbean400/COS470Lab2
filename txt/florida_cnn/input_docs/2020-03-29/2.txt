Governor Ron De Santis said questions surrounding Florida beaches remaining open during spring break are " more of a political issue . " 
De Santis said a family sitting outside in " sunshine , heat and humidity " was not " a problem , " when compared with the New York subway being " packed like sardines . " 
" Do you hear the same people complaining about the New York City subway system being open ? 
I mean , give me a break . 
Which one is more conducive to having Covid 19 spread or any respiratory virus ? 
It 's not even close , " he told reporters . 
De Santis noted that he had imposed a " 10 person limit " for groups and local officials maintained limited access to beaches for residents . 
Several Florida beaches were closed by local officials in Miami Dade , Palm Beach , Martin , St . Lucie and Indian River counties .
