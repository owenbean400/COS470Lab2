If you were hoping for an early summer vacation in Hawaii this year , the state â€™s governor hopes you think again . 
" Certainly we will be extending the 14 day mandatory quarantine for all travel into the state until the end of June , " said Gov . 
David Ige during an online question and answer session . 
The quarantine rule was established in mid March , and Ige said at the time that tourists should cancel their travel for at least 30 days . 
The state has cracked down on visitors who fail to abide by the quarantine , in some cases telling them to leave the islands entirely . 
Arrested for violating quarantine : Earlier this month , Hawaiian police arrested a California couple on their honeymoon after they ignored warnings to stay inside their hotel room . 
In late April , a Florida man and Illinois woman were also arrested by Honolulu police after breaking quarantine . 
Hotel staff notified authorities after seeing the couple return to their room with shopping bags and takeout food , according to state health officials . 
" Our initial goal is to educate people , " Lt . 
Audra Sellers of the Maui Police Department said . 
" Our efforts are meant to keep people safe and stop them from spreading the virus . "
