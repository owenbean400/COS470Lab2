3M , the largest maker of N95 face masks in the country , has sued a Florida company for allegedly twice offering to sell tens of millions of 3M N95 respirators to the federal Division of Strategic National Stockpile at inflated prices . 
3M also says the company , Orlando based Geftico LLC , falsely claimed to be associated with 3M as a distributor and that the masks in question were " likely nonexistent . " 
CNN has made multiple attempts to reach the president of Geftico and the law firm listed on the Florida Division of Corporations website as the company ’s registered agent for comment , but has not received a response . 
The lawsuit alleges that at different times , Geftico offered to sell a specific model of 3M N95 masks for $ 6.77 per respirator , over four times more than 3M ’s suggested list price of $ 1.27 per respirator and for $ 3.60 per respirator , still nearly three times the suggested price . 
3M is seeking injunctive relief to require Geftico to cease trying to sell masks and also requests damages , according to the complaint . 
If the company wins damages in the lawsuit , 3M said it will donate the money to charities working on Covid 19 relief , according to the complaint . 
Some context : Amid the novel coronavirus pandemic , N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment are in high demand for medical personnel . 
The lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits 3M has filed recently alleging companies have price gouged and counterfeited their products . � �
