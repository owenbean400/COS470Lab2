Data scientist Rebekah Jones , whose home was raided Monday morning by Florida police , said in an exclusive interview with CNN that this wo not stop her from reporting Covid 19 data . 
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating whether Jones , who was fired by the state Department of Health in May , accessed a state government messaging system without authorization to urge employees to speak out about coronavirus deaths , according to an affidavit by an agent working on the case . 
Jones told CNN that after reviewing evidence with her attorneys , she thinks the state is not after her . 
" They did not take the router in my house , " Jones said . 
" They did not take a number of laptops in the house that belonged to my son or my husband that could have easily done whatever it is that they think happened . 
They took my phone , and they took the computer that I use to run my companies . 
And on my phone is every communication I 've ever had with someone who works at the state , who has come to me in confidence and told me things that could get them fired or in trouble like this . " 
" I just want to say to all those people right now , if he does not know already , ( Florida Gov . Ron ) De Santis will know soon enough that you 've been talking to me . 
So be careful , " Jones added . 
The former top coronavirus data scientist at the state health department said she has not had access to any agency systems for over six months , adding , " The only direct communication I 've ever sent to DOH was through a public op ed in the Miami Herald asking people to speak out and that was many months ago .
