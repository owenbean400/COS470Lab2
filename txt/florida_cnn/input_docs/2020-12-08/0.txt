Florida police raided the home of a former state coronavirus data scientist on Monday , escalating a feud between the state government and a data expert who has accused officials of trying to cover up the extent of the pandemic . 
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement executed a search warrant Monday morning at the home of data scientist Rebekah Jones , who was fired by the state Department of Health in May . 
The agency is investigating whether Jones accessed a state government messaging system without authorization to urge employees to speak out about coronavirus deaths , according to an affidavit by an agent working on the case . 
Jones told CNN that she had not improperly accessed any state messaging system and that she lost access to her government computer accounts after she was removed from her position . 
About 10 officers with guns drawn showed up to her Tallahassee home around 8:30 a.m . , Jones said . 
A video taken from a camera in her house , which she posted on social media , showed an officer pointing a gun up a stairwell as Jones told him her two children were upstairs . 
Jones said that the officer was pointing his gun at her 2 year old daughter , 11 year old son and her husband , who she said were in the stairwell , although the video does not make that clear . 
Officers also " pointed a gun six inches from my face " and took all of her computers , her phone and several hard drives and thumb drives , Jones said . 
Gretl Plessinger , a spokesperson for the law enforcement department , said that agents knocked on Jones ' door and called her " in an attempt to minimize disruption to the family . " 
Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung up on the agents , and Jones ' family was upstairs when agents did enter the house , Plessinger said . 
She did not respond to questions about why the officers drew guns .
