Students from two Florida high schools are going to have a graduation ceremony like no other . 
Chip Wile , the president of the Daytona International Speedway , is planning a drive through commencement to honor graduating seniors at the local high school . 
Wile said the students and their families will be in their own cars and drive across the finish line when their name is called over the speakers in the stadium where they will be handed a diploma through the window . 
" This is a once in a lifetime opportunity , " he said . 
The ceremony will be broadcast on the speedway 's low frequency AM radio so the graduates can hear it in their cars , Wile said . 
" Then they 'll then make an entire lap around the speedway – at slow speeds – and then they 'll park at pit end , right where the cars end at pit road , and we 'll actually do a hat toss , " Wile said . 
" So really trying to find all of the different elements that happen at graduation , and be able to incorporate them into the event , " he added . 
Hunter Perez , a senior at Matanzas High School who will be participating in the graduation ceremony at the speedway , said it is going to be an event he never forgets . 
" I think I most look forward to getting that picture at the speedway . 
Something that I 'll be able to show others . 
And always have something to remember , " he told CNN .
