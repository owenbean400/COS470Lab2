Even as Florida continues to report thousands of new coronavirus cases each day , Gov . 
Ron De Santis today floated the idea of allowing visitors at nursing homes . 
" I think a lot of the family members understand that these are difficult circumstances , " he said today at a roundtable in Jacksonville , Florida . 
" Clearly they would not want policies to be done that would lead to massive amounts of people in these facilities getting infected . 
But I think that if you have a way forward , I think that would put a lot of people at ease , knowing that there ’s a light at the end of the tunnel . " 
De Santis said he believes family members who have Covid 19 antibodies should be able to visit relatives . 
The governor said he will form an exploratory committee , which will include Florida Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Mary Mayhew , to discuss policies that could be implemented to ensure safe visitation at Florida ’s 4,000 nursing home facilities . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and various public health experts all recommend strongly against this approach . 
They say it is not known if having antibodies protects you from becoming infected again or from spreading the virus to others . 
The CDC also says : Antibody test results should not be used to determine if someone can return to work . 
Antibody test results should not be used to group people together in settings such as schools , dormitories , and correctional facilities .
