Dr . Jonathan Reiner , former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s cardiologist , said the first wave of the pandemic is still " burning hotly " in large parts of the US , even if the White House does not want you to know about it . 
" The administration and the vice president are peddling an alternative reality that just does not jibe with what is truly happening in this country , " Reiner told CNN ’s Don Lemon . 
Reiner is currently a professor of medicine at George Washington University . 
He said some parts of the country did an amazing job beating back the coronavirus , like New York , Massachusetts , and Illinois , where new reported case numbers have fallen . 
But in the South and Southwest , places like Florida , Texas , and Arizona , " new cases and hospitalizations are increasing dramatically . " 
He believes the vice president and President ’s choice to hold a rally this weekend is " criminal endangerment " and he criticized the Republican leaders for making appearances without wearing masks .
