Erika Crisp was one of 16 friends who tested positive for coronavirus after one night out at a recently reopened Florida bar . 
She told CNN 's Chris Cuomo that she now regrets her decision to go out that night . 
" At the time it was more ‘ out of sight , out mind , ’ we had not known anybody who had it personally , governor , mayor , everybody says it ’s fine , we go out and it ’s a friend ’s birthday , it was a mistake , " Crisp said . 
Kat Layton echoed Crisp ’s sentiments , and says she hopes her story will serve as a cautionary tale for others who might be itching for a return to a crowded bar . 
" My experience is definitely of course , regretful . 
We feel foolish , standing there in front of those people , we knew we were pushing it , " Layton said , " We want to raise awareness and get ahead of it , we want to tell people it ’s really not ready for what we thought it was ready for , it ’s too soon . " 
Dara Sweat told Cuomo she grew apprehensive as the text messages from her friends began to pile up . 
" I was a little scared and nervous , and receiving the text messages that my friends were just ‘ boom , positive , boom , positive , boom , positive , back to back to back , it was overwhelming , " she said .
