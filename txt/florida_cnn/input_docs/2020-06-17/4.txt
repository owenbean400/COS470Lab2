A group of 16 friends all tested positive for coronavirus after a night out at a recently reopened Florida bar . 
They now want to warn and remind the American public that the pandemic is not over yet . 
Three members of the group spoke to CNN 's Chris Cuomo on Tuesday night , and said they want others to be more cautious about taking advantage of looser coronavirus restrictions . 
The group had gathered for a friend 's birthday , they said . 
The bar was crowded , and no one was wearing masks . 
" Standing there in front of those people , we knew we were pushing it , " Layton said . 
At the time , the virus was " out of sight , out of mind " since they did not know anyone who had contracted it and they heard from their mayor and governor that everything was fine , Erika Crisp said . 
But within days , they started getting sick . 
" Receiving the text messages that my friends were just boom , positive , boom , positive , boom , positive , back to back to back , it was overwhelming , " Dara Sweat told Cuomo . 
Everyone in the group tested positive ; and though some had flu like symptoms , none got seriously ill . 
The women said they are confident they contracted the virus on that outing . 
Since then , they said , they have been messaged by strangers who also got sick after visiting the same bar that weekend . 
Though Florida is continuing to reopen from coronavirus restrictions , the state recorded a record number of new cases on Monday , according to the Florida Department of Health .
