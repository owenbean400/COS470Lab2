Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis doubled down on not issuing a statewide mask mandate in the Sunshine State Monday during a press conference . 
When a reporter asked De Santis if he had reconsidered a statewide mask mandate , the governor got testy with the reporter and answered with a series of his own questions . 
As Covid 19 cases in Florida are inching closer to the one million mark , De Santis touted that the increase in cases in other states are " way , way more . " 
De Santis said that shutting down has not worked to stop the spread of the virus in other places .
