For a second straight day , Florida broke its record for the number of daily coronavirus deaths . 
Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said that the county will see a high number of deaths for a while , but that there is a " silver lining . " 
But the hospitalization rate is stable , and cases are not rising anymore , he said . 
" We are stabilized and we 're coming down . 
So not rising is also very , very good news â€¦ There is a silver lining to this , but it will take some time for us to go down to where we would like to see it , somewhere around the 5 % level . 
We 're still a long way , " he said . 
The average positivity rate is at about 18 % , he said .
