With millions of parents preparing for the upcoming academic year under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic , Dr . Anthony Fauci said " we should try as best as we possibly can to get the children back to school . " 
Fauci instructed parents to be vigilant because of the varying levels of the infections across the country . 
This advice from the nation 's top infectious disease doctor comes hours after Gov . 
Ron De Santis of Florida advocated for parents to be able to choose either in person or distance learning as districts in the state weigh their options for the upcoming school year . 
Florida is one of the states that has recorded a spike in Covid 19 cases . 
" So if you have a level of virus that really is very , very low , then you could likely proceed with impunity , depending on the local situation , with getting the child back to school with no restrictions . 
If you 're in an area where there is some virus involved , the local authorities may do things like try to modify the school situation , " Fauci added .
