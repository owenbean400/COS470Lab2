After much criticism , Gov . 
Ron De Santis announced during a press conference Saturday that Florida will be releasing the names of nursing homes and long term care facilities with Covid 19 cases . 
There are 1,627 cases of coronavirus at these facilities , including both residents and staff , per De Santis . 
At the onset of the pandemic , De Santis said he prohibited visitors and ordered anyone entering nursing homes be screened . 
To help prevent outbreaks at these facilities , De Santis said he has sent " strike teams " into nursing home facilities across the state to do spot testing for the virus to identify asymptomatic staff members who may be infected . 
De Santis says he has asked Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees to compile the information and release it to the public . 
Management at nursing homes are already required to notify residents , staff and families when cases of Covid 19 arise , De Santis said . 
The names of patients or people who have died from Covid 19 will not be released , De Santis said . 
According to the governor , between 90 and 100 deaths from coronavirus in Florida were related to nursing homes or long term care facilities . 
De Santis has another pressing decision to make on nursing homes : Will he release them from liability ? 
The Florida Health Care Association , a federation that represents 600 long term care centers , has asked De Santis for immunity for workers . 
Democratic state Sen . 
Gary Farmer told reporters during a conference call last week that if De Santis gave nursing homes immunity , the move would be " outrageous , " " unprecedented " and " unconstitutional . " 
During a press conference Friday , De Santis said he has not made a decision on the issue .
