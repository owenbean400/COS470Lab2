There is still no clue as to how an individual in Manatee County , Florida , acquired the novel coronavirus that has now infected more than 90,000 people globally . 
According to a source with knowledge of the situation , contact tracing for the infected person has failed to reveal any potential source of infection . 
They have had no travel to any affected regions , nor have they had any contact with an individual who tested positive . 
Although the individual lives in Manatee County , the source says they are believed to have gone to an ER at a hospital in nearby Sarasota County , Florida earlier in the week . 
But the individual was only tested for the virus on Saturday , after Florida expanded its testing criteria on Friday evening . 
That means any healthcare worker who had been treating the patient , without the proper protection , was at danger of being exposed to the virus .
