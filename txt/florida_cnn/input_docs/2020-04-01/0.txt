As more and more foreign passenger vessels require medical evacuations for people with flu like symptoms , the US Coast Guard 's strained local medical resources are feeling the pressure . 
According to a Marine Safety Information Bulletin issued by the US Coast Guard and obtained by CNN , the increased demand " is leading to the establishment of improvised field hospitals . " 
The Zaandam cruise ship , which is headed to Florida with dozens of people with flu like symptoms -- and at least eight people who tested positive for Covid 19 -- is flagged in the Netherlands . 
It is requesting to dock at Port Everglades . 
There are 305 US citizens on board , including 49 Floridians . 
Foreign flagged vessels that sit beyond US territorial seas " should seek flag state support prior to seeking support from the limited facilities in the U.S , " the bulletin said . 
The bulletin goes on to say that an evacuee " has better access to comfortable surroundings and medical staff on board the foreign passenger vessel where care is already being provided . " 
" This is necessary as shore side medical facilities may reach full capacity and lose the ability to accept and effectively treat additional critically ill patients , " the bulletin said .
