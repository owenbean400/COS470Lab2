Vice President Mike Pence spoke of the cruise ship off the coast of San Francisco in a meeting with members of the cruise line industry in Florida today amidst the coronavirus outbreak . 
Pence also said " while the risk to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low , it is essential that we find ways to mitigate that risk to prevent the spread of coronavirus and I â€™m here today on behalf of President Trump to learn ways that this industry , the cruise line industry , can work with our health officials at the federal level , here at the state level with port authorities to give the passengers , communities and the country safe and healthy . " 
Adam Goldstein , global chairman of the Cruise Lines International Association , told Pence it was the " commitment " of the cruise line industry to " work closely with government and to go above and beyond anything we are currently doing to screen even more stringently to prevent those who should not be allowed to board , to monitor and test and care for those who are on board and to transition and help pay for any sick guests or crew to move to locations staffed and equipped COVID 19 cases . " 
" We will work aggressively with government to further develop and strengthen all necessary protocols for prevention , for detection and for care , " Goldstein said . 
Florida Gov .
