Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said the pandemic has become " a political thing " in regards to wearing face mask . 
Gelber said he does not know why Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis has not issued a statewide mandate , saying that mask wearing is " how we are going to keep our economy open a little bit and that 's how we are going to get out of this . " 
Asked if he agreed with a statement that an infectious disease expert in the Jackson Health System in Miami made saying the city is comparable to what was seen in Wuhan six months ago , Gelber said , " Well , I think clearly from the metrics . 
I mean , we have over 400 people in intensive care , 215 residents on ventilators . 
Those are way higher than anything previously . " 
He then said that it was not an unfair comparison . 
Gelber said the numbers are growing , but they have yet to feel the impact of the ICUs , ventilators , and deaths because " that 's usually two to three weeks later . " 
He went on to say that his county hit 3,000 positive cases today . 
Florida has 282,435 cases of Covid 19 and at least 4,277 people have died from the virus in the state .
