Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said there are simple things states can do to turn around the trajectory of the virus in the US . 
Fauci spoke about how after not shutting down the country completely , the US saw surges in states like California , Arizona , Texas and Florida , among others , as the country began to reopen . 
He said the guidelines released for initial reopening attempts did not work well for the country , noting that some states went from shutdown to " complete throwing caution to the wind , " using examples of people without masks in crowded bars . 
However , Fauci said that he is " confident " the US can get a handle on this situation . 
" You do not necessarily need to shut down again , but pull back a bit . 
And then , proceed in a very prudent way , observing the guidelines of going from step to step , " he said .
