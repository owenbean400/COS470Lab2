As coronavirus cases continue to soar in Florida , Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines , Florida , is past its ICU capacity , and the team is now " creating space at every inch of the building , " CEO Leah Carpenter says . 
In an effort to manage the surge , the hospital has canceled all elective surgeries so it can redeploy staff in high priority areas , she added . 
Carpenter says the team has the resources it needs right now but " if the surge continues , I have significant concerns about whether or not we â€™ll have what we need . " 
She noted there are concerns about the availability ventilators , oxygen supply , dialysis equipment and personal protective equipment .
