Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis asked Floridians to listen to local officials , including Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Giménez , when it comes to taking precautions to prevent the spread of Covid 19 — including wearing face coverings . 
" I know many Floridians are filled with apprehension as they wonder , you know , what does this mean ? 
What do these trends mean for our health , for our families and for our jobs ? 
How long is this going to go on for ? 
What 's going to happen with things like kids being in school ? " the governor added . 
" I hear ya . 
And I along with our federal partners , our local leaders and our great medical community , we 're working non stop to be able to respond to this crisis . " 
De Santis said the state has seen record Covid 19 numbers . 
" The percentage of people who were testing positive has finally started to decline , we 'll see if that 's a trend , or whether that was , that will be something that is short lived . 
Certainly we can say that the percentage of people who come in and test positive has stabilized , " he said .
