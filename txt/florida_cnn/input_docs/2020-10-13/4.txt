After announcing five new Covid 19 positive tests within the football team earlier on Tuesday , the University of Florida has paused team activities , according to a statement from Athletics Director Scott Stricklin . 
Stricklin said the decision was made out of an abundance of caution . 
Stricklin said in his statement that he has had conversations with Southeastern Conference leaders as well as Texas A&M , who Florida played last week , and LSU , who Florida is scheduled to play this Saturday . 
Stricklin added that head coach Dan Mullen has been in communication with the football players and their families . 
At a news conference Monday , Mullen told reporters , " I think if you look at what we 've been able to do , the safety precautions we have that our players have followed , our coaches follow , our staff follows , you know , I think we 're a model of safety of what we 've been doing during this time period . 
So I 'm really proud of how we 've handled everything and how safe we 've been with everything we 're doing and all the precautions we 've had in place during this time . " 
Stricklin said the situation will be re evaluated by UF Health and the athletic department 's sports medicine staff on Wednesday .
