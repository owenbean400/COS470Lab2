The number of new Covid 19 cases per week has tripled in Florida since Gov . 
Ron De Santis reopened the state in one swoop in late September . 
The week before Florida reopened , the state reported more than 17,000 new cases . 
In the past seven days , Florida has recorded more than 53,000 new cases . 
That means three times more Floridians per week are testing positive for Covid 19 now , than the week the state was reopened . 
In an effort to curb the spread of the virus , a bipartisan group of mayors from across the state asked De Santis last week to issue a mask mandate , bolster contact tracing , increase funding for Covid 19 testing , and give mayors more local control . 
De Santis issued a video message last week sharing " promising news " about therapeutics and vaccines -- but he did not address the rise in cases .
