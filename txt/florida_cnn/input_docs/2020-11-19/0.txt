Karin Smith , a Florida resident and single mom of a 14 year old boy , is one of millions of Americans who may lose expanded unemployment benefits on Dec . 26 . 
She said she is able to qualify for food stamps , but has given up on going to food banks because " if they open at 9 , you have to be there at 5 a.m . to hope to get anything . " 
Smith previously worked for the Department of Education in data compliance and has been searching for a new job . 
" It 's not laziness â€¦ A job making $ 8 an hour is not going to pay my $ 1,650 rent , let alone all the other expenses I have because I had a good job , " she said . 
Smith said her son is old enough to understand her stress and has tried to help with his own suggestions , like buying a motor home and moving them into it because he does not want to lose their dog or cat .
