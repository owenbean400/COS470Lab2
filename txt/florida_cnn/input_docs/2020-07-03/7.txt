Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said there ’s no reason against a statewide mask mandate , but it ’s the " best bet " to leave orders up to mayors and county administrators . 
Castor put a mandatory face mask order in place about two weeks ago , and she said the vast majority of people have been adhering to it . 
City government at this point has provided 400,000 masks to its residents , she said . 
" The last thing we can afford is to be knocked backwards , and that 's why I 've encouraged everyone to wear a mask , " Castor said . 
Other places in Florida , including Miami , Jacksonville and Palm Beach County , now require wearing masks in public as Covid 19 cases have spiked in the state .
