Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber says there should be a statewide mask mandate in Florida and across the whole US . 
" There 's over 1,300 Covid patients in my county right now and 1,000 people have died . 
… It 's not time to make political statements about wearing a mask . 
It 's time to comply and make sacrifices for everybody else , " he told CNN ’s Jim Sciutto . 
Beaches in Miami Beach are now closed for the holiday weekend . 
There is a curfew in place and masks are mandatory in public places . 
Gelber encouraged his residents to stay home and celebrate the Fourth of July . 
Gelber said there have been mixed messages about the coronavirus from state and national leaders , which confuses people and is daunting for city officials . 
The mayor took aim at President Trump ’s remarks that there ’s only more coronavirus cases in the country because there is more testing . 
" This whole argument that there 's more Covid simply because we 're testing more is absurd . 
You ca not fake being so sick you have to be hospitalized or so absolutely sick , you ’ve got to be in intensive care or on a ventilator , " Gelber said .
