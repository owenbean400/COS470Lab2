In a scathing letter to Florida ’s Gov . 
Ron De Santis , Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber called out De Santis for the " unprepared " and " failed " contact tracing response to Covid 19 which led to the " unconstrained growth of the virus " in Miami Dade County . 
" Florida ’s contact tracing program in Miami Dade County is unprepared to meet the challenges of this pandemic and I urge you to take immediate action to expand its capacity and improve its competencies , " Gelber continued . 
" When Miami Dade emerged from our shelter in place in May , the State ’s contact tracing program fully failed to cabin subsequent disease surges as we reopened our economy . " 
Gelber pointed out that Miami Dade County needed more than 800 trained contact tracers when the reopening plan began . 
Gelber said his understanding is that Miami Dade had less than 200 in May . 
A few weeks ago , Gelber added , he was advised that on a " successful " day Florida connected with 17 % of people who had been infected . 
Gelber ’s letter included a chart showing the state ’s efforts to contact trace . 
Gelber added that " case closed " does not mean the connections have been completed , instead these are newly infected people who were unwilling to cooperate or failed to return calls . 
" Your DOH is successfully contact tracing an average of 18 % of those infected per day and sometimes as low as 7 % over this 14 day period , " Gelber wrote . 
Gelber said local officials are being tasked with the decision making while localities lack health department officials who can provide advice on the pandemic . 
The mayor warned that if the infection levels continue at the current pace , he could see a return to sheltering in place . 
CNN has reached out to De Santis ’ office for comment .
