Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis said today during a press conference with Vice President Mike Pence that parents should have a choice on what instruction is best for their children this fall . 
De Santis said that if a parent believes that distance learning is the best for their child right now , they should have a right to do that . 
He said he is proud of what they have done in the state of Florida in distance learning but at the same time , the kids have lost a lot of gains by not being in the classrooms . 
He said that many parents in the state of Florida want to see their kids get back to school while a lot of teachers want to get back to the classrooms as well . 
" I really believe that the teachers and the administrators that are there , they serve important functions in the lives of so many of our kids , particularly those who come from more disadvantaged backgrounds , " De Santis said .
