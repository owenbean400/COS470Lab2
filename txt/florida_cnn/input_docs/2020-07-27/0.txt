The United States has a fourth of global coronavirus cases and as officials work to slow its rampant spread , face coverings remain a point of contention as some local authorities are declining to enforce mandates . 
Florida : Police in Miami -- what experts call the country 's coronavirus epicenter -- issued more than 300 citations in 10 days to individuals and businesses that are not abiding by the local mask order . 
The county has reported more than 100,000 coronavirus cases -- more cases than all but 12 states . 
Over the weekend , ICUs were at 137 % capacity and there were about 334 patients on ventilators , about a 64 % increase in two weeks , according to county data . 
While Florida 's governor has not ordered a statewide mandate , Miami Dade County announced earlier this month it was tightening restrictions around its order on face coverings by punishing violators with a $ 100 fine . 
Indiana : A statewide mask order went into effect Monday morning , but sheriffs in at least four counties said they would not enforce the mandate , according to CNN affiliate WXIN . 
" If a disturbance or other issue were to develop , deputies would respond as always ; however , we will not respond solely for allegations of a violation of the executive order , " said Johnson County Sheriff Duane Burgess , according to the affiliate . 
Ohio : The governor issued a statewide mask order last week , and one sheriff already said earlier this month he would not be enforcing any sort of mandate , according to CNN affiliate WLWT . 
" I can tell you this -- I am not the mask police . 
I am not going to enforce any mask wearing . 
That is not my responsibility . 
That is not my job . 
People should be able to make those choices themselves , " said Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones .
