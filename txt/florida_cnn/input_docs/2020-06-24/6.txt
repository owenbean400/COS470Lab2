Rebekah Jones , the data official behind Florida 's Covid 19 dashboard , has launched her own dashboard , which reports more cases than the state reports . 
She attributes these differences to including non residents who test positive or die of coronavirus in Florida . 
Another point of differentiation is including everyone who tested positive , regardless of the type of tests that they have received . 
Some background : Jones was removed from the state 's scrutinized dashboard project after she questioned other officials ' commitment to accessibility and transparency , according to Florida Today . 
She tweeted several tweets yesterday claiming that the the state â€™s health department officials have been instructed to change and delete numbers of Covid 19 cases and deaths to make it looks like " Florida is improving next week in the leadup to July 4 . "
