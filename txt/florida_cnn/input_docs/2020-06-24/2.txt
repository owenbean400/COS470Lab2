An Orlando area bar near the University of Central Florida has had its liquor license temporarily suspended for violating reopening guidelines , after 13 employees and 28 customers tested positive for coronavirus , Florida Governor Ron De Santis announced in a Tuesday press conference . 
The Knight 's Pub was said to be in " flagrant violation " of reopening guidelines , after it failed to enforce any of the state 's required social distancing protections . 
Orange County Health Officer Dr . Raul Pino told CNN affiliate WFTV that 152 cases have been linked to the Knights Pub . 
" That 's about 50 % of the people who entered the bar , " Pino said . 
De Santis said businesses failing to comply with state rules would get a visit from Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears , whom he called " the grim reaper for business licenses . "
