Dan Gelber , the mayor of Miami Beach , Florida , said officials are working to make sure people are being careful this Labor Day weekend to avoid another spike in Covid 19 cases . 
He said authorities have given out fines for not wearing masks and capacities are in place at restaurants . 
This comes after Florida just reported it lowest number of new Covid 19 cases in nearly three months . 
But , in the past , numbers have spiked after other big holiday weekends like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July . 
Gelber said things like wearing masks and social distancing allow for the economy to reopen safely , but people need to stay vigilant . 
" I 'm hoping that people really get accustomed to it â€” it becomes a little bit part of our culture , and it 's very important that we have a unified message , up and down government , up and down the private sector that ... please wear the mask . 
You 've got to do it , " he said .
