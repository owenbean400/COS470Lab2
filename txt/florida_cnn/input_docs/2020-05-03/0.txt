Most ninth grade girls worry about schoolwork , friends and crushes . 
Lately , however , Valerie Xu has focused on face masks . 
The 15 year old from Addison , Texas , says she wanted to do something about the lack of protective gear for medical workers during the coronavirus pandemic . 
She also wanted to combat stories stigmatizing Asian Americans during the outbreak . 
Armed with resourcefulness and a teenager 's urge to fit in , Xu raised donations and delivered 10,000 protective masks to a Dallas medical center . 
Some background : The donation drive started with a conversation Xu had with a family friend , a Florida emergency room doctor who was forced to wear the same protective mask for several days . 
Since Xu wanted to make a local impact , she launched a Go Fund Me to purchase masks for the UT Southwestern Medical Center , the largest facility near her home . 
So far , it has raised more than $ 3,800 . 
Xu researched vendors in China and picked two suppliers , donating $ 1,200 of her own money to the cause . 
She said her campaign so far has collected a total of 11,200 masks –– 10,000 surgical and 1,200 FFP2 masks , which are equivalent to N95 masks in the US .
