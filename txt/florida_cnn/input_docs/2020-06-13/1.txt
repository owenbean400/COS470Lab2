In an interview with Stadium on Saturday , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said that he supports the NBA ’s restart plan . 
He added : " You know essentially testing everybody , make sure that you start with a baseline of everybody being negative and trying to make sure that no influx into that cohort of individuals . " 
Some background : The NBA 's Board of Governors voted earlier this month to restart the suspended 2019-2020 season with 22 of the league ’s 30 teams taking part . 
The Board of Player Representatives of the National Basketball Players Association approved further negotiations with the NBA on a 22 team return to play scenario to restart the 2019-20 NBA season . 
The new schedule will see training camps open the first half of July with a tentative resumption of the regular season reportedly on July 30 . 
The league said the season restart is contingent on a deal made to utilize the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando , Florida , as an isolated campus to hold all games , practices and residency . 
" It 's something that I think is a sound plan , " Dr . Fauci said . 
" I was very pleased to see that the intent was not reckless at all , they really wanted to make sure that the safety of the players and the people associated with the players was paramount . " 
He said this could possibly be used as a model for other sports depending on how the system works .
