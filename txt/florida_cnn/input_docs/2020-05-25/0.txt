A Charlotte city councilman said President Trump 's threats to pull the Republican National Convention from North Carolina are not realistic . 
Earlier today , Trump contended that Gov . 
Roy Cooper is " unable to guarantee " that the arena will be allowed " full attendance . " 
He told CNN 's Brianna Keilar that he thinks the Covid 19 pandemic has been politicized . 
" I think at first , at least in our state , we were seeing a lot of bipartisan cooperation for doing what 's best for the citizens of North Carolina . 
That seems to be fraying , " Egleston said . 
Vice President Mike Pence on Monday suggested a trio of other states — all with Republican governors — as possible RNC replacements for North Carolina . 
" It 's an issue we 've been talking about because these national conventions literally take many months to organize and prepare and there are states around the country -- we think of Texas , we think of Florida , Georgia , the last two states I visited last week that have made tremendous progress on reopening their communities and reopening their economies , " Pence said . 
Egleston reacted to the mention of moving the convention to Texas , Georgia , and Florida . 
" If the reason that they ’re moving is because they do not want to adhere to some of the precautions … I think it ’d be pretty reckless of those states , " he said .
