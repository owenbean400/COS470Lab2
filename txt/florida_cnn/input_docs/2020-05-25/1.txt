The mayor of Daytona Beach , Florida , Derrick Henry said the city needs to educate visitors about the rules and regulations that have been put in place to try to prevent the spread of coronavirus . 
" We have to do it through our website and use messaging boards as people are entering the city to inform them of what we 're expecting and what they can and cannot do , " he added . 
This comes after a video released by the Volusia County Sheriff 's Office showed a crowd of people not socially distancing while celebrating Memorial Day weekend in Daytona Beach . 
Henry said the crowd came from Orlando and Miami for " a big celebration of sorts because they were happy to be out . " 
" If you are going to be a guest , you are a guest and we want you to come with a guest mentality . 
Otherwise we want you to choose another destination , " he said . 
The latest numbers : There has been at least 659 coronavirus cases and 37 deaths in Volusia county where Daytona Beach is located , according to the Florida Department of Health . 
Cases in Florida increased this weekend â€“ from at least 563 on Saturday to about 997 on Sunday .
