Gov . 
Ron De Santis is taking " advantage of this pause " in business to complete infrastructure projects in Florida , he said at a press briefing Saturday . 
Having less people on Florida roads is an opportunity to make some progress on Orlando 's I 4 " construction congestion , " De Santis said . 
The $ 2.3 billion project aims to reconstruct 21 miles of the interstate in Central Florida , according to De Santis . 
On average , the interstate sees " well over 100,000 cars a day " but " now you 're dealing with volumes that are probably 40,000 , " allowing for increased road closures without affecting as many people , Florida Department of Transportation ( FDOT ) Secretary Kevin Thibault said . 
De Santis says the sped up contract will increase day time operations and allow for longer hours . 
Thibault projects FDOT will be able to " get this work done in one to two months . "
