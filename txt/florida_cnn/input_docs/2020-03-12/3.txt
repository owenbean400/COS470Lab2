Sen . 
Rick Scott , a Florida Republican , said Thursday he would self quarantine after potentially coming into contact with a Brazilian government aide who tested positive for coronavirus . 
He said that while doctors told him his risk was low and that he did not need to take a test nor quarantine , he would do so out of an abundance of caution .
