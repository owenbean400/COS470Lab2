Dr . Anthony Fauci , the US 's top infectious disease expert , said he ’s " strongly in favor " of local mask mandates to help control the spread of the coronavirus . 
" When you look at what we can do that we know works , it ’s the use of masks , physical distance and avoiding crowds , " Fauci said at a press conference on Tuesday with Sen . 
Doug Jones , an Alabama Democrat . 
As of Monday , 35 states plus Washington DC and Puerto Rico , had some type of mask requirement order in place as coronavirus cases surge in parts of the United States . 
Hospital ICUs are near capacity in some areas , including Florida and Texas . 
Fauci , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said he ’d like to see consistency in using face coverings to slow the spread of the deadly virus . 
" Individual mandates , wherever they come from , I think are important because when people get a signal that you may or may not want to wear a mask , which means it may or may not be helpful , that 's a very confusing signal , " he said . 
" So , if you ’re saying it does not matter whether you put it on or take it off , you 're giving a wrong , mixed signal . 
The signal should be : Wear a mask . 
Period . "
