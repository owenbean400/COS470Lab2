Rebekah Jones , the data official behind Florida 's Covid 19 dashboard who launched her own dashboard after she said she was removed from the state 's project , said that she does not see an end in sight to the state â€™s coronavirus surge . 
Florida does not track probable coronavirus cases , Jones explained . 
When people are tested as they arrive at the ER , " that does not count as an active hospitalization until their positive test result is received by [ the Florida Department of Health ] . " 
Some background : Jones was removed from the dashboard after the Florida DOH said she had " exhibited a repeated course of insubordination " during her tenure there . 
" I was flat out told repeatedly that we were not adding hospitalization data , even though all of our epidemiologists said it was one of the most important indicators of how our health care system is handling the influx of cases , " she said . 
She said she has contacts at the Department of Health who occasionally give her documentation , and many counties are at 70-80 % capacity . 
" The data out there is available . 
They just do not make it public themselves , " Jones said . 
Jones added that her data shows that the highest percent increase of coronavirus cases has been under 18 , whereas the lowest percent increase in the last week compared to previous weeks was in the 18 to 35 age group .
