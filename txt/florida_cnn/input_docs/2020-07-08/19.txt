The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for reopening schools are the minimum of what the country should be doing to make sure that schools can reopen and stay open , public health expert Dr . Ashish Jha told CNN today . 
Jha added that the spread of Covid 19 in the community must be kept under control for schools to open safely â€“ something that is not happening in multiple hotspots around the country . 
" We , in those hotspots , ca not afford to have indoor gatherings of 10 or more , " Jha said . 
Jha said it is " cavalier " to say it would be safe to open schools because the virus does not make children sick as often as it does adults . 
Kids can and do get sick , and kids can spread the virus to adults , Jha noted . 
Jha also disputed remarks made by Vice President Mike Pence and Coronavirus Task Force Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx , who said they are seeing encouraging trends in hotspots like Texas , Arizona and Florida . 
Jha said he sees the numbers as going up , not down . 
" I 'm looking at the same data that they are , and I 'm not seeing it . 
I wish they , I hope that they 're right , " he said . 
" But positivity rates in my mind are continuing to go up in Arizona and Texas and Florida . 
Cases are going up , hospitalizations are going up , and now I think we have very clear evidence that death rates are starting to go up in these in these places as well . " 
Across the country : Jha said national coronavirus infection numbers do not give a complete view . 
He said while infection rates are going down in some places , like New York , New Jersey and Massachusetts , they are spiking in other parts of the country , such as Texas , Arizona , Florida , South Carolina , Mississippi and Nevada . 
" If you put both of them together in the same picture , it looks flat , " he said .
