" Mixed messages " are confusing people and leading to the spread of coronavirus in Florida , says Carlos Hernandez , the mayor of Hialeah , a city in Miami Dade County . 
" That 's making it very difficult at the city levels because people are getting different messages from the federal government , state government — even here at the county , we 're getting mixed messages , " Herandez said . 
The Republican mayor said the lack of contact tracing is " not acceptable . " 
He said he is not aware of any contact tracing being done in his city by state officials . 
" This is something that if we do not unite and if we do not all take care of each other , again , we ’re going to find ourselves in a very critical situation very soon in south Florida , " he said .
