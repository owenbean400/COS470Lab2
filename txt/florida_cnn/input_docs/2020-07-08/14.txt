Despite Florida ’s order to reopen schools in " brick and mortar " fashion in the fall , Broward County Schools could remain closed because Broward County is still in phase one of the reopening plan , according to Robert Runcie , Broward County Public Schools Superintendent . 
Earlier today , school superintendent Alberto Carvalho of Miami Dade County — which is directly south of Broward County — tweeted his school system would " ONLY proceed with in person schooling " if Miami Dade County successfully transitioned to phase two . 
Miami Dade is currently in phase one .
