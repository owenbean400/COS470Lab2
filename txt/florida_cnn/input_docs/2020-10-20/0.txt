Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber slammed Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis , accusing him of adopting a controversial declaration that advocates for herd immunity . 
He said it would lead to more hospitalizations and deaths . 
While the state â€™s case level remains stable , Gelber said he is concerned about not being able to enforce mandatory mask orders and curfews for bars . 
He said he also worries about visitors to his city spreading Covid 19 to their home states . 
" We are trying to literally protect our residents from their government at this point , because we ca not even impose a requirement that people get citations for not wearing a mask . 
And that 's become a real problem , because I worry about the uptick becoming a surge , " Gelber said .
