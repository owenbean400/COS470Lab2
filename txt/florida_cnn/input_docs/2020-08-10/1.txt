As the legal battle over the reopening of Florida public schools continues , at least 12 county public schools systems are planning to reopen this week and offer in person instruction , according to Mark Richard , Florida Education Association attorney . 
According to Richard and the school district websites , the school districts opening this week are Baker , Bradford , Dixie , Franklin , Gilchrist , Hamilton , Suwannee , Martin , Calhoun , Hardee , Union and Wakulla . 
CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield said last month that officials in counties with a positivity rate higher than 5 % might consider keeping schools closed ; and White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx agreed with Redfield ’s take on the matter on CNN ’s State of the Union with Dana Bash on August 2 . 
On Saturday , 9 of 12 counties reopening schools this week had a positivity rate above 5 % , according to the latest data available from the Florida Department of Health . 
The same data showed that in the past two weeks , all 12 counties on some days exceeded 5 % positivity rate , with some counties far exceeding that metric . 
For example , Baker County had a 36.9 % positivity on Friday and Bradford had a 42 % positivity rate on Thursday .
