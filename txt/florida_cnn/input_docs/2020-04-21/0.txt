Park staff in Tampa , Florida , were patrolling closed parks when they noticed someone working out in a park downtown . 
It was NFL star Tom Brady , said Tampa Mayor Jane Castor in a briefing on Monday . 
" Now , I always tell people , I â€™m not one to gossip so you did not hear this from me , " she said . 
Brady was given a citation for being in the park , she added . 
The 42 year old is widely considered the greatest quarterback of all time , spending almost his entire NFL career -- 20 seasons -- with the New England Patriots , winning six of the nine Super Bowls he reached . 
He is now the quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , after signing a multi year contract with the NFL team in March .
