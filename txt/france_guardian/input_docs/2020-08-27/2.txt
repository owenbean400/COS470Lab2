Reports of Syrian health care facilities filling up , and increasing death notices and burials , appear to indicate that actual coronavirus cases in the war torn country far exceed official figures confirmed by the government , a senior UN humanitarian official has said . 
Syria has so far reported more than 2,500 cases of Covid 19 , including 100 deaths . 
However , UN Assistant secretary general for humanitarian affairs , Ramesh Rajasingham , told the UN Security Council that rising patient numbers are adding pressure to the fragile health system in Syria , now in its 10th year of war . 
Many people are reluctant to seek care at medical facilities , leading to more severe complications when they do arrive , he said , adding that health workers still lack sufficient personal protective equipment and associated supplies . 
Of the virus cases confirmed by the Syrian Ministry of Health , Rajasingham said , the majority cannot be traced to a known source . 
He said several health facilities briefly suspended operations this month because of capacity issues and staff becoming infected by the coronavirus . 
In the Al Hol camp in northeast Syria , where 65,000 mainly women and children connected to Islamic State fighters are detained , Rajasingham said 12 health facilities had to suspend operations this month due to staff becoming infected , having to self isolate , or due to lack of personal protective equipment . 
Both field hospitals at the camp have since resumed operations , he said . 
Germany and Belgium , who are in charge of Syrian humanitarian issues in the Security Council , said in a joint statement that the spread of Covid 19 across the country is increasing exponentially . " 
Testing capacities remain very low , so most cases may go unnoticed , they said . 
" Numbers we hear may only represent the tip of the iceberg . " 
They also warned that " the destruction of health facilities and the shortage of health workers dramatically imperil any response " .
