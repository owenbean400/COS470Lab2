More help needs to be targeted at specific sectors of the UK economy such as the automotive industry in the wake of the coronavirus crisis , Labour has said . 
Shadow business minister Lucy Powell accused the Conservatives of " turning their back " on pledges to help areas where the vehicle manufacturing industry is concentrated , such as the north Midlands , Wales and Yorkshire . 
They include parts of the country where Labour lost ground heavily in the December general election . 
Powell said the automotive sector has been badly hit by the Covid 19 outbreak , stating that new car registrations were down 97 % in April . 
Labour said analysis by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders ( SMMT ) found car production was down around 50 % in June compared with the year before . 
Powell also called for support for the industry ’s supply chain , as well as focus to be put on creating " green jobs " and ensuring the UK leads the way in decarbonisation . 
The shadow minister said : The UK ’s world leading automotive industry has been rocked by coronavirus and livelihoods are on the line . 
But ministers wo not listen to reason and are refusing to recognise some sectors have been hit harder than others . 
They must urgently target support at the sectors that need it with a focus on creating skilled , green jobs - and do right by the communities across the UK they promised to protect . 
Anything less would be a betrayal of many communities which helped get Boris Johnson elected .
