President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to ensure that priority access for COVID 19 vaccines procured by the U.S . government is given to the American people before assisting other nations , a senior administration official told Reuters . 
Trump , who has faced sharp criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic , is eager to take credit for the speedy development and distribution of a vaccine . 
The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told reporters the order would set up a framework for U.S . government agencies to help other countries procure the vaccine as well . 
It was unclear why an executive order was needed to ensure that the vaccines would be distributed in the United States . 
The White House is holding a summit event on Tuesday to highlight the distribution process through Trump ’s Operation Warp Speed , which has been organizing the effort . 
Officials from Democratic President elect Joe Biden ’s transition team were not invited to the summit .
