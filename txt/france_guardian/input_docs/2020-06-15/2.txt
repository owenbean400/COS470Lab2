Turkey ’s health minister warned citizens against complacency on Monday as daily coronavirus cases doubled compared with figures in early June , Agence France Presse reports . 
The country registered 1,592 new cases and 18 Covid 19 deaths for the past 24 hours , Fahrettin Koca said on his official Twitter account . 
There were 786 infections in a 24 hour period on 2 June . 
At the height of the pandemic , Turkey recorded over 5,000 daily cases in April . 
Koca ’s tweets often remonstrate those ignoring the continued dangers from the pandemic . 
Düne kıyasla vaka sayımız 30 , yoğun bakım hasta sayımız 5 , entübe hasta sayımız 1 artış gösterdi . 
ARTIŞLAR BELLİ BÖLGELERDE YOĞUNLAŞIYOR . 
Rehavet mi , mücadele mi ? 
Maske + mesafe kuralına hep birlikte uyarsak , yayılımı kontrol altına alabiliriz . 
Güç bizde . 
In capital letters , he wrote on Monday : " The increases are intensifying in certain areas , " but did not offer further information . 
" Will it be complacency or a fight ? 
We will be able to control the spread if we all adhere to the mask and distancing rule , " Koca added . 
In recent weeks , Turkey has allowed intercity travel including the resumption of domestic flights , reopened cafes and restaurants , and ended weekend lockdowns . 
With the latest figures , Turkey ’s fatalities have reached 4,825 and the total number of cases are nearly 180,000 . 
Between April and late May , Turkey was under weekend curfews as the government sought to avoid a full lockdown like in France in a bid to keep the economy going .
