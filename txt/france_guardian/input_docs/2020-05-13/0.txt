The French drugmaker Sanofi SA is working with European regulators to speed up access to a potential vaccine in Europe after its chief executive suggested Americans would likely get the vaccine first . 
The company said it is in talks with the European Union and the French and German governments to speed up regional vaccine development . 
Sanofi , whose Pasteur division has an established track record of producing influenza vaccines , teamed up with British rival Glaxo Smith Kline last month to come up with a candidate it hopes will be ready next year . 
They have received financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) of the US Health Department . 
As a result , doses produced in the United States are expected to go to US patients first ; a prospect that has raised concern in Europe . 
Sanofi ’s chief executive Paul Hudson has told Bloomberg : The US government has the right to the largest preorder because it ’s invested in taking the risk . 
We are very encouraged to see the mobilisation of the [ European commission ] over the past weeks , exploring similar measures that could expedite both vaccines development and access to the European population . 
The company said that remainder of its vaccine manufacturing capacity will cover Europe and the rest of the world .
