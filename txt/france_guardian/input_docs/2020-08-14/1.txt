Canada will grant permanent residency to asylum seekers who cared for coronavirus patients in hospitals and care homes at height of the pandemic last spring , Marco Mendicino , the immigration minister has said . 
Mendicino said the program is a way to thank those who " put themselves at the greatest risk " of contracting the coronavirus . 
They will be able to apply for residency for themselves and their families if they had submitted their application by March 2020 , even if their demand had already been rejected . 
The decision would affect about 1,000 claimants across the country , the CBC reports .
