Croatia recorded 208 new coronavirus cases on Friday , the country â€™s chief epidemiologist Krunoslav Capak has said . 
" The average age of those infected is 31 years as some two thirds were infected in the nightclubs and bars that remain open beyond midnight , " Capak told a news conference . 
Croatia will require that bars and nightclubs to close after midnight for a period of 10 day from this weekend , similarly to Greece . 
This follows Italy introducing mandatory testing for all those entering the country from Croatia , while Slovenia also floats the idea of requiring people visiting Slovenia from Croatia to present negative tests before entering the country . 
Austria has warned against visiting Croatia . 
A number of localised outbreaks in Europe , including in Italy and Germany , have been traced back to travellers returning from trips to party hot spots in Croatia in the past couple of weeks , notably from the island of Pag , Reuters reports . 
Croatia has registered a total of 6,258 cases so far , with 163 deaths recorded .
