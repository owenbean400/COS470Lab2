Around 850 French passengers who were onboard a coronavirus riddled cruise ship that was turned away from numerous ports in March have filed a collective suit in Paris with 180 complaints , including manslaughter , against Costa Cruises , their lawyer said on Sunday . 
The class action , which includes complaints from the families of three passengers who died of Covid 19 , accuses the Italy based cruise giant of negligence and various faults during their trip on the Costa Magica . 
From 6 to 13 March the ship was refused to dock in most of the Caribbean islands it visited , including Trinidad and Tobago , Grenada , Barbados and Saint Lucia . 
In the absence of stopovers , the crew encouraged the passengers to use the ship â€™s shops , spas , restaurants and casino without sufficiently putting health measures in place , or informing them there were suspected infections onboard , the complainants said in their suit . 
The staff members on the ship " were at fault , the passengers had almost no information and only found out from local media that there were cases on the ship , " lawyer Philippe Courtois , who represents the collective of some 850 French passengers , told AFP . 
Courtois also criticised the " extremely light " virus measures on the ship . 
" It was meant to be a dream cruise , but it ended in an ordeal , " he said . 
Costa Cruises , which is part of the Carnival group , has suspended its trips worldwide until 15 August due to the pandemic .
