Binational couples separated by coronavirus travel and immigration restrictions will soon be granted a ‘ laissez passer ’ - a special exemption that allows the partner from the high risk country to be reunited with their partner in France , the daily Sud Ouest reports . 
Since travel restrictions and lockdown rules were introduced in France in March , some couples have been living a long distance relationship in two different countries . 
Secretary of state for tourism and French people Jean Baptiste Lemoyne announced on Saturday that a derogatory procedure would allow binational couples to meet again . 
From Monday , a laissez passer can therefore be issued in consulates for one of the spouses to join the other in France . 
They " must present themselves at the consulate with documents attesting to common activities , their identity documents , proof of residence in France for the French spouse , a return ticket " , Lemoyne said .
