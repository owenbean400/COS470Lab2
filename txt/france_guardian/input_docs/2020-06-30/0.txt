Airbus â€™ plans to shed 15,000 jobs are " excessive " and need to be revised , a French finance ministry source has told Reuters . 
Airbus earlier unveiled the job cut plans , saying its future was at stake after the pandemic hit the air travel industry particularly hard . 
The source said : The number of job cuts announced by Airbus is excessive . 
We expect Airbus to fully use instruments put in place by the government to reduce job cuts . 
Airbus also needs to reduce involuntary cuts as much as possible .
