Boutiques in the centre of the French capital shut early and shoppers hurried home to meet a new 8pm curfew that took effect on Tuesday to try to prevent a new spike in Covid 19 infections . 
Around the usually bustling shopping district , shop fronts were dark and , of the few people on the streets , most were heading towards the metro station . 
Tuesday brought new freedoms for people in France because it was the end of a stay at home order . 
This had meant that , around the clock , people could only venture out for a limited time and for essential trips , to shop , or to exercise . 
But that was replaced instead with a nightly curfew . 
From 8pm until 6am people can only go out for work , on official business , or for medical reasons . 
Anyone breaking curfew is liable for a € 135 ( $ 165 ) fine . 
Officials have warned they will be strictly enforcing the new rules . 
Interior minister Gérald Darmanin on Tuesday evening joined a police patrol in Yvelines , west of Paris , to check people were complying . 
" The government has decided to be particularly tough on unlawful parties , " the minister said . 
Infection rates in France have declined sharply since the peak of the second wave last month . 
But scientists warn of the risk of a third wave of infection if people let down their guard during the Christmas and New Year holidays .
