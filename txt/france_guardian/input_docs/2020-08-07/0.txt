Sarthak Anand says his neighbours treated him like a " criminal " when he got coronavirus , a common experience in India ’s vast hinterland where the pandemic and stigmatisation are now raging . 
" Even though I have recovered fully , no one wants to come near me , " Anand , a government employee , told AFP outside his home in Meerut , a northern Indian city home to 3.4 million people . 
On Friday India ’s official caseload passed two million , and while previously metropolises like New Delhi and Mumbai were the hotspots , smaller cities and rural areas are now reporting sharp rises . 
According to public health expert Preeti Kumar , the probable reason is the return home of millions of migrant workers who were left jobless by India ’s sudden lockdown imposed in March . 
" We are seeing the numbers rise especially in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh , and with poorer healthcare systems , it is going to be a challenge , " Kumar told AFP . 
The poor northern state of Uttar Pradesh , home to roughly as many people as France , Germany and Britain combined , has now seen the pandemic reach almost every district . 
The state has recorded 100,000 cases . 
Its capital Lucknow is reporting more than 600 new infections every day , compared to only 100-150 just a few days ago .
