Astra Zeneca is working with regulators to investigate a lower dosage of its vaccine that performed better than a full dosage , a spokesman for the company said , after its chief executive was quoted as saying an additional global trial was likely . 
Asked about the Bloomberg report on the additional trial , a spokesman for Astra Zeneca said : " As we communicated earlier this week , there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate the half dose/full dose regimen . 
" We are further evaluating the data and will work with regulators on the best approach for further evaluation . 
This would add to data from existing trials which are currently being prepared for regulatory submission . "
