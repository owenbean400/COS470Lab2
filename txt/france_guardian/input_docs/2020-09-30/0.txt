Germany declared regions in 11 European countries as areas with an elevated risk of exposure to the coronavirus , while existing warnings about parts of Belgium were extended to cover the entire country . 
In its list published late on Wednesday , the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases also declared the whole of France , with the exception of the Grand Est region , to be a risk zone , as well as the whole of Iceland , Wales and Northern Ireland . 
Risk zones were also declared in Estonia , Ireland , Lithuania , Romania , Slovenia , Hungary and Croatia . 
Such declarations , which result when the prevalence of coronavirus infections exceeds 50 per 100,000 population over a week , are typically followed by the foreign ministry issuing a travel warning . 
The latest warnings , a blow to hopes that a swift revival of tourism could give the continent ’s pandemic struck economies a boost , came as officials across Europe warned that a second wave of the virus was imminent . 
Germany , traditionally Europe ’s largest source of tourists , has warned against travel to the rest of the world since March , but the warnings were lifted for the EU and countries with close ties to it in June .
