Dentists face a " tsunami " of untreated tooth decay because children have been kept away from dental surgeries during lockdown . 
Half of parents in the UK said their children had missed a check up since March , according to an Opinium survey for the Association of Dental Groups ( ADG ) , which represents practices across the country . 
The survey of 2,000 people included 622 parents , with 31 % saying their family had decided not to go for a check up or make an appointment . 
Another 13 % said they had not been able to get an appointment â€“ a sign of the growing problem of delays caused by the pandemic .
