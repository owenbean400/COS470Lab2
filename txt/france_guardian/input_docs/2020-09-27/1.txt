Too many children are being tested for coronavirus because of an understandable but misplaced concern about school outbreaks , a leading scientist has said , as a study shows they are about 40 % less likely than adults to be infected . 
Prof Russell Viner of UCL and Great Ormond Street children ’s hospital , the study ’s lead author , is calling for schools to be kept fully open in light of the findings , because of the serious harm done to children by classroom closures . 
" I think we have a coherent policy about testing in schools , but we are probably being overcautious and testing too many children , " said Viner . 
" It was the right thing to start with , but it has had some unintended consequences . 
" The key thing about this research is that it supports keeping schools open . 
Schools need to be open and be almost the last places to close . 
As part of learning to live with this virus , we need to be keeping schools open . "
