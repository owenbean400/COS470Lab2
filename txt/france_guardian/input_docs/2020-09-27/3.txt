The Scottish government has just issued updated guidance that students can return to their family homes ( previously clinical director Jason Leitch said they could not ) either to self isolate or permanently . 
This is provided the entire household they return to self isolates and they do not use public transport . 
Of course , this guidance comes too late for the many student who reportedly have already left halls in a mass weekend exodus . 
While NUS Scotland ’s president , Matt Crilly , welcomed the clarity on returning home , he was " disappointed that the government continues to talk up in person teaching , which may keep students on campus and increase risks unnecessarily " . 
NUS Scotland is calling for the Scottish government teaching guidance to advise remote learning as default , and is also asking institutions and private providers refund rent if students want to end their contracts and return home . 
Likewise , they want to see support for those who want to defer study for another year . 
Interesting to see too that , as the new guidance appeared , Alastair Sim – director of Universities Scotland – which last week issued harsh overnight regulations for students including an edict not to party or socialise beyond their households , a one weekend nationwide ban on going to bars and restaurants which applied to mature and part time students as well as those in halls , and threats of severe disciplinary action for breaches and police involvement – issued a rather more ameliorative statement . 
" We asked more of students than is asked of anyone else ; a group we know is caring , responsible and socially minded , " it says . 
" This weekend , we asked all students not to go out to pubs , restaurants and cafes . 
It was a request , not a ban . 
It was never a ban . " 
When is a ban not a ban ? 
When it ’s a poorly coded apology .
