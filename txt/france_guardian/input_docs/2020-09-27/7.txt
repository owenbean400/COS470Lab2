Travel between New Zealand and some states of Australia is possible before the end of the year , New Zealand ’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday . 
Plans for a travel ‘ bubble ’ between Australia and New Zealand has been in discussions for months as both nations slowed the spread of the coronavirus , but they were disrupted after a resurgence of Covid 19 in Melbourne , Australia , followed by a second wave of infections in Auckland . 
With the virus largely contained in New Zealand , and as cases continue to decline in Australian regions , talks of a travel bubble with some states have been revived . 
When asked by state broadcaster TVNZ whether New Zealanders would be able to travel to at least some Australian regions before Christmas , Ardern said : " It is possible . " 
" What we would need to be assured of is that when Australia is saying ‘ okay we ’ve got a hotspot over here ’ that the border around that hotspot means that people are not able to travel into the states where we are engaging with in trans Tasman travel , " she said . 
Ardern said Australia was pretty satisfied with both how New Zealand was tracking now and how they are tracking generally . 
New Zealand has only 59 active cases and 1,477 confirmed cases of Covid 19 so far , one of the lowest tally in the world .
