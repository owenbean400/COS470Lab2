Bosses at Manchester Metropolitan University have said students under a Covid 19 lockdown are free to leave their student halls but " trust they will do the right thing " and self isolate , following a number of students saying they were being falsely imprisoned . 
Prof Malcolm Press , vice chancellor of the university , said they were unable to stop some 1,700 students from leaving the quarantined campuses but stressed he expected students to follow government guidance on self isolating . 
Students described being scared and confused as their accommodation was locked down on Friday after 127 people tested positive for coronavirus . 
Press said the " physical and emotional wellbeing of our students is paramount " and acknowledged the impact of the " extremely short " notice given . 
He added : " Many of them are away from home for the first time and still finding their feet . 
" Their welfare is our top priority and that is why we have been working hard with organisations around the city since Friday evening to put in place support to help during this 14 day period . " 
Press said the university was preparing care packages and financial support for self isolating students . 
He stressed : " We expect students to follow the guidance for self isolation set out by the government and Public Health England . 
Our staff are on hand 24 hours a day to provide , support , guidance and deal with concerns . 
" We are unable to prevent our students from leaving the halls , but our students are bright , young adults and we trust that they will do the right thing . "
