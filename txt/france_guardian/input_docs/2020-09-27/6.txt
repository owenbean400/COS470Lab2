Labour has attacked the UK government â€™s winter job support scheme , accusing it of consigning more than a million workers " to the scrap heap " . 
Sectors of the economy which generate billions in tax revenue and employ huge numbers of workers are not covered by the plans , according to the opposition . 
Labour said that in his winter economic plan , the chancellor failed to mention businesses that are not able to operate , because they are either shut down or trading with hugely reduced capacity , including the weddings industry , events and exhibitions , major parts of the night time economy , festivals , sports venues and theatres . 
Shadow ministers said there was no acknowledgement about their plight or the fact that they will be forced to remain fully or mainly closed for the next six months . 
Labour said its analysis of official statistics suggested that more than a million workers are employed in these sectors . 
Lucy Powell , shadow minister for business and consumers , said : " The chancellor is consigning whole sectors of our economy to the scrap heap , damaging lives and livelihoods , and threatening the recovery . 
" The failure of ministers to ensure an effective test , track and trace system means that many businesses have no idea when they can reopen . 
Even for those who can access it , the job support scheme is badly designed and could lead to a wave of job losses . "
