Inadequate tests for Covid 19 , based on poor or dodgy data , are proliferating in the UK because there are no clear rules on what companies have to prove before they can sell them , experts believe . 
The Royal Statistical Society ( RSS ) has set up a working group to investigate and draw up guidelines for the companies making the tests and those who assess them and buy them . 
The organisation says there are " concerns about a lack of basic statistical evidence on clinical and analytical performance of a number of new diagnostic tests that are available " .
