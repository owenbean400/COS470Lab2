New York state ’s daily count of coronavirus cases topped 1,500 for the first time since late May as the governor , Andrew Cuomo , warned local governments they will face fines if they do not enforce social distancing and mask rules . 
Officials are increasingly concerned about virus flare ups in parts of New York City and suburban Rockland and Orange counties . 
Although an oft cited measure of the virus ’s spread the percentage of tests that come back positive is about 1.3 % statewide , it is over 6 % in a group of about 20 ZIP codes under scrutiny , Cuomo said . 
And the raw number of new cases reported statewide on Thursday hit 1,598 , the most since 27 May , when considerably fewer New Yorkers were tested : about 65,000 , compared with 119,000 on Thursday . 
The hot spots are a significant problem , Cuomo said , adding " compliance is not where it needs to be " .
