President Emmanuel Macron will give a televised address on Wednesday evening , as French authorities explore fresh restrictions to curb the spread of Covid 19 . 
The Élysée palace did not say what Macron ’s address would be about , but such televised statements have in the past been the occasion to announce new anti virus measures . 
The French leader has held meetings to review the state of the epidemic in recent days . 
The French government has been exploring bringing in a national lockdown from midnight on Thursday , BFM TV reported , albeit a slightly more flexible one than the two month shutdown that began in mid March . 
Schools could remain open even as restrictions on people ’s movements become more severe , BFM TV added . 
Sources told Reuters earlier this week that options being envisaged for some areas included confining people to their homes at weekends , closing non essential shops and starting curfew measures earlier . 
France imposed a daily curfew on major cities two weeks ago that runs from 9pm to 6am .
