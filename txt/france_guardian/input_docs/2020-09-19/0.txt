France has joined a string of other countries in reporting yet another record increase in infections today . 
French health authorities reported 13,498 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday , setting another record in daily additional infections since the disease started to spread in the country . 
The number of people in France who have died from Covid 19 was up by 26 , at 31,274 , and the cumulative number of cases now totals 442,194 , as the seven day moving average of daily new infections rose to more than 9,700 , compared with a low of 272 at the end of May , two weeks after the lockdown was lifted . 
A faster circulation of the virus and a six fold increase in testing since the government made it free are the two main reasons for the scale of the increase , epidemiologists have said , according to Reuters . 
Health authorities reported a sudden jump in the country â€™s daily death toll from Covid 19 on Friday because of unreported cases in one hospital near Paris .
