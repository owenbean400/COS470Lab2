Doctors in northern Italy , one of the areas hardest hit by the new coronavirus , and in France have reported spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the United States , Britain and Spain , according to a report in The Lancet . 
The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever , rashes , swollen glands and , in severe cases , heart inflammation . 
Reports of cases have raised concerns that Covid 19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus , could pose a greater risk to children than had been understood . 
It has so far taken its greatest toll on the elderly and those with chronic health conditions .
