The timetable for delivery of the Oxford University and Astra Zeneca Covid 19 vaccine candidate has slipped and Britain will receive just 4m doses of the shot this year , the head of the UK ’s vaccine procurement programme said on Wednesday . 
In May , Britain agreed a deal for 100m doses of the vaccine , developed by Oxford and licensed to Astra Zeneca , with 30m doses estimated for delivery by September 2020 . 
Oxford ’s trial chief said earlier he was optimistic that late stage trial results of its efficacy could be presented before the end of the year , and that doses of the shot are already being made . 
UK Vaccine Taskforce chair , Kate Bingham , said the target of 30m doses of the vaccine by September had not been achieved , and she estimated that Britain would get 4m doses by the end of the year instead . 
" The predictions that were made in good faith at the time were assuming that absolutely everything would work and that there were no hiccups at all , " she told lawmakers . 
She said the scale up in manufacturing usually took years to do but instead was moving at unprecedented speed , adding that the full 100m doses would be delivered next year . 
" We ’re starting with low numbers of doses – by which I do mean millions of doses , but not tens of millions of doses initially – and then that will then ramp up so that we will end up with the 100m doses ... in the first half of next year , " she said .
