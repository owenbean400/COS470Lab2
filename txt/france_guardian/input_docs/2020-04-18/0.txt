France registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday , bringing the total to 19,323 , the fourth highest tally in the world , although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running . 
France â€™s public health authority said in a statement that the total number of people in intensive care units also fell for the 10th day in a row , to 5,833 - the lowest level since March 31 . 
The figures show that the numbers of infections and deaths remain at a high level but having reached a plateau a week ago the curve is beginning to go noticeably downwards . 
Unlike in the UK , deaths in care homes are included in the figures . 
France has been in virtual lockdown since March 17 as part of efforts to curb the outbreak .
