Ontario ’s finance minister Rod Phillips has resigned after public outrage over a Caribbean holiday he took this month in violation of his own government ’s coronavirus travel warnings . 
Phillips , a member of the ruling Progressive Conservative party in the Canadian province , admitted this week he had travelled to the French island of St Barts on 13 December after the legislative session ended . 
Federal and provincial leaders across Canada have urged the public to avoid non essential travel because of the pandemic . 
" Today , following my conversation with Rod Phillips , I have accepted his resignation as Ontario ’s minister of finance , " Ontario premier Doug Ford said . 
" At a time when the people of Ontario have sacrificed so much , today ’s resignation is a demonstration that our government takes seriously our obligation to hold ourselves to a higher standard . " 
Ford admitted he had known for weeks that his finance minister – who faked social media posts to conceal his location – had ignored the coronavirus lockdown to go on holiday in the Caribbean . 
Posts on Phillips ’s social media accounts suggested he remained home over Christmas . 
Ford said he has asked Peter Bethlenfalvy to step into the finance minister ’s role and deliver the government ’s 2021 budget in addition to his current role as president of the province ’s treasury board . 
Phillips served as Ontario ’s minister of the environment before becoming finance minister as part of a 2019 cabinet reshuffle . 
He returned to Canada on Thursday and apologised for his actions . 
Ontario , home to Canada ’s industrial and manufacturing heartland , began a lockdown on 26 December to curb the spread of the virus .
