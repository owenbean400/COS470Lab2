" I am determined to do all that I can to protect everyone receiving and providing care this winter . 
Nationally , locally and at the front line , we must intensify our efforts to support , protect and equip everyone in the system . 
" With the prevalence of coronavirus rising in the population and in social care , now is the time to act . "
