A match scheduled to kick off Colombia ’s football league has been postponed after seven players and six of the coaching staff of one of the teams tested positive for coronavirus . 
Players and coaching staff from football club Tolima , which leads the Colombian league with 16 points from eight matches , tested positive for the virus . 
The team had already arrived in Medellin to compete against rival team Nacional at the Atanasio Girardot stadium on Friday night . 
" This is not the best way to start the league , " the president of Colombia ’s football association ( DIMAYOR ) , Fernando Jaramillo , said in a virtual press conference . 
While those players and members of the technical team who tested positive did not travel to Medellin , the Ministry of Health raised concerns other players and people from Tolima could have been infected , despite testing negative for coronavirus . 
" We knew this could happen but despite this , we are going to move forward , " Jaramillo said . 
" The priority is the health of everyone who is involved in the league , which is why we decided to postpone this match . " 
The Colombian soccer championship , which was suspended in March , will be played behind closed doors and without fans present , in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus . 
Almost 744,000 have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the Andean country , while more than 23,000 have died . 
Other matches planned for this weekend will continue as planned , Jaramillo said .
