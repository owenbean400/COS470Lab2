US senator Bill Cassidy tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday , has decided to self quarantine for 14 days and is contacting those with whom he may have had contact , according to a statement released by his office . 
" I am strictly following the direction of our medical experts and strongly encourage others to do the same , " the Louisiana Republican , himself a physician , said in the statement . 
At least 15 other members of the House of Representatives and Senate - eight Republicans and seven Democrats - have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid 19 since the onset of the pandemic earlier this year . 
Rand Paul , a Republican , is the only other senator to have tested positive for the virus , back in March . 
Two other senators , Democrats Tim Kaine and Bob Casey , said in May that they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies . 
Neither chamber is in session at the moment . 
In July , the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a mask mandate for the House floor after Louie Gohmert , who often refused to wear a mask , tested positive . 
Elsewhere in the Capitol , mask wearing is encouraged for lawmakers , but not mandated .
