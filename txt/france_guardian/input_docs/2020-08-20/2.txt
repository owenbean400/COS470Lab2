Slovenia has added neighbouring Croatia to its quarantine list , meaning that returning travellers will have to self isolate . 
The decision to put Croatia on the list already comprising nearly 60 countries will come into effect at midnight , said the interior minister , Ales Hojs . 
Travellers already in Croatia will be able to avoid a requirement to quarantine themselves for 14 days if they return to Slovenia before midnight on Monday , Hojs added . 
Croatia escaped the worst of the first wave of the pandemic owing to swift lockdowns and a lack of tourist arrivals at the tail end of winter , promoting itself as a safe destination for tourists . 
But on Thursday it registered 255 new infections , bringing the total number of cases to 7,329 . 
Slovenia has recorded 2,356 Covid 19 cases , dozens of which have been traced to people returning from trips to party hotspots in Croatia in the past couple of weeks . 
According to Croatia â€™s tourist board , more than 140,000 Slovenes visited the Adriatic country this month . 
On Thursday , the UK also added Croatia to its quarantine list while Germany advised against travel to the regions of Sibenik Knin and Split Dalmatia , which are popular with tourists , after the public health agency declared them coronavirus risk regions , making tests for returnees mandatory . 
Croatia is the source of the third highest number of infections among people returning to Germany , after Kosovo and Turkey , according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases .
