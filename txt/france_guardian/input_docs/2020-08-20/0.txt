Nigeria will bar entry to citizens of countries that do not allow in Nigerians due to coronavirus restrictions , the aviation minister , Hadi Sirika , has said . 
Sirika told reporters : The principle of reciprocity will be applied . 
If you ban us from coming to your country , the same will apply the other way . 
Earlier this week , Nigeria announced plans to resume international flights on 29 August . 
All but essential international flights were halted in late March in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus . 
The resumption will begin with four flights daily to Lagos and Abuja , but Sirika said that initially the number of passengers would be limited to 1,280 a day . 
Nigeria has 50,488 confirmed cases of Covid 19 and has recorded 985 deaths .
