Simon and Briony Rea from London flew from Heathrow to Split just hours before the news was announced that the UK government would remove Croatia from its travel corridor lsit . 
They immediately started to look into how they could leave before 4am on Saturday when the new quarantine rules come into effect . 
We are due to go to a friend ’s wedding and I really do not want to let him down by being stuck isolating at home . 
Indirect flights from Split are currently about £ 900 each so we are looking at getting an 11 hour ferry from Split to Ancona in Italy and spending the rest of the holiday there . 
We had read about the possibility of Croatia being taken off the list but we decided to take the risk because of the financial implications of not going . 
The couple estimate that they will lose about £ 750 on hotel bookings , as well as having to pay for the ferry and hotels in Italy . 
We ’re just frustrated that there is not a testing process on our return to the UK so we can avoid having to isolate . 
It ’s ridiculous .
