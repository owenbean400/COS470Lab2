Indigenous protesters on Thursday blocked a key Brazilian grain highway in the Amazon state of Para , the federal highway police said , resuming a protest that halted trucks carrying corn earlier in the week . 
The Kayapó tribe say the federal government has failed to protect them from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed four of their elders , and has not consulted them on a plan to build a railway next to their land . 
The Kayapó returned to the BR 163 highway in the region of Novo Progresso at 7am local time on Thursday , police said . 
The BR 163 highway links towns in the nation ’s biggest farm state Mato Grosso to the port of Miritituba , an important export river gateway in Para state . 
With the soy season almost over , the main grain transported on the road at present is corn . 
Edeon Vaz Ferreira , executive director of Pro Logistics Movement , a group linked to the Mato Grosso Aprosoja farmers association , said corn is still being shipped , but the situation is becoming increasingly complex . 
" Any stoppage complicates the flow , and the programming of barges and ships , " Ferreira said , without giving further details on how the port has been affected by the protests . 
Earlier this week , the Brazilian Vegetable Oil Industries Association ( Abiove ) said a blocked BR 163 highway could affect around 50,000 tonnes of soy and corn exports a day on their way towards the port of Miritituba . 
A court ruling this week ordered the protesters to leave the road , which the Kayapó complied with temporarily on Wednesday . 
But they show no sign of backing down permanently as they insist that government representatives meet them for talks .
