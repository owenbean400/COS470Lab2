Reuters earlier reported that France ’s death toll had stood " at 31,585 , up from 31,274 published day earlier " – an apparent increase of 311 . 
However , the news agency has since sent an update saying the number of French deaths from the disease rose by 12 over the preceding 24 hours to 31,585 – obviously a very different figure . 
It looks like the increase of more than 300 is due to late reporting – rather than deaths in the last 24 hours , which amount to 12 . 
My apologies for the confusion – I ’m reaching out for further clarification on this .
