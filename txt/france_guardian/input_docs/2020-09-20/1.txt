Tens of thousands of private renters in England and Wales could be at risk of losing their homes when the ban on evictions ends on Monday , campaign groups say . 
Renters in England and Wales have been protected from eviction during the Covid 19 outbreak by a ban announced in March which was then extended , meaning anyone served with an eviction notice since August 29 has been given a six month notice period . 
But up to around 55,000 households in England who were served notices between March and August do not enjoy this protection and need further help , said campaign group Generation Rent . 
The National Residential Landlord Association ( NRLA ) said it has encouraged landlords to " work with their tenants to sustain tenancies wherever possible " . 
But the NRLA added it is important to begin tackling the " most serious cases " including tenants committing anti social behaviour and domestic abuse , or with rent arrears which " have nothing to do with Covid 19 " . 
Labour has called for protective measures to be extended and has warned of a winter homelessness crisis , while the Local Government Association ( LGA ) has said councils are " concerned that the ending of the ban could see a rise in homelessness " .
