France â€™s economic output will contract by 2.5-6 % in the last quarter of 2020 depending on the length of the current partial lockdown , national statistics service Insee said Tuesday . 
It now forecasts that the French economy will contract by 9-10 % overall this year . 
The government reimposed a lockdown at the end of October as the number of coronavirus infections and hospitalisations surged higher . 
The conditions are not as strict as those imposed in March , however , and Insee expects the impact on the economy to be considerably weaker .
