Trained dogs can identify people with Covid 19 , even those with no symptoms , according to researchers . 
In the preliminary study , dogs who sniffed swab samples of armpit sweat could tell which samples came from Covid 19 patients and which were from people who tested negative for the new coronavirus . 
That study was conducted in March . 
More recently , the researchers have validated the findings in additional trials , said study leader Dominique Grandjean of Alfort veterinary school in France . 
Dogs can identify infected individuals with 85 % to 100 % accuracy and rule out infection with 92 % to 99 % accuracy , Grandjean said . 
It takes one 10th of a second for a trained dog to say ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ , " he said . 
Training requires three to eight weeks depending on whether the dog is already trained for odour detection . 
Covid 19 detecting dogs have already been deployed in airports in the United Arab Emirates , Grandjean said . 
On Wednesday , the UAE and the International K9 Working Group Against Covid 19 will host a virtual workshop on the use of these trained dogs , with 25 countries expected to participate , according to the organisers .
