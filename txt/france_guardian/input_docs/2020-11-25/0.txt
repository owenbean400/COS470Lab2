On Tuesday , Macron said France will start easing the lockdown this weekend so that by Christmas , shops , theatres and cinemas will reopen and people will be able to spend the holiday with their families . 
However , French restaurants and cafes would have to stay shut until 20 January to avoid triggering a third wave .
