French prime minister Edouard Philippe claimed victory in the race to become mayor of Le Havre in Sunday ’s municipal elections . 
He won with 58.8 % of the vote , according to TF1/LCI TV . 
" We ’re happy in Le Havre , we will celebrate this victory , " Philippe said . 
France ’s constitution allows Philippe to nominate a deputy to his mayoral seat while he remains prime minister , but his victory will raise questions over a possible government reshuffle . 
Philippe will meet with president Emmanuel Macron on Monday morning for a one to one meeting . 
The result comes in municipal elections where amid persistent fears of coronavirus contagion , just over a third of voters had turned out by 5pm , three hours before polling stations close , according to the interior ministry .
