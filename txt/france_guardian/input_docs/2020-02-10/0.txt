The director general of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has said recent cases of coronavirus reported in France and the UK could " be the spark that becomes a bigger fire " . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus ’ comments came after a British man , who caught the virus at a conference in Singapore , was linked with other cases in the European countries . 
Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK , while five British nationals tested positive in France following the Sussex businessman ’s trip to a French ski resort . 
Ghebreyesus told a press conference : " In recent days we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China , like the cases reported in France yesterday and the UK today . 
" The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire . 
But for now , it ’s only a spark . 
Our objective remains containment . 
" We call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire . "
