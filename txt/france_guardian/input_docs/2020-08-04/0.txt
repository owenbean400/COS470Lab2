The group , which runs high end chains such as Raffles and Sofitel , and budget brands like Ibis , plans to cut costs by € 200m by 2022 . 
The pandemic has led to the closure of several Accor hotels around the world and 1,000 of the group ’s 18,000 employees will lose their jobs , financial chief Jean Jacques Morin said . 
" It is difficult to implement cost saving measures in our industry without it having an effect on staff , " Morin said . 
" We will help them , " he said , of the 1,000 people to be laid off . 
Accor posted half year net losses of € 1.5bn ( $ 1.7bn ) against profits of € 141m during the same period last year .
