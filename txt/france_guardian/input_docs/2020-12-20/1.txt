At Gatwick Airport on Sunday evening , flights to destinations across central and eastern Europe were packed with last minute travellers trying to get home before bans on travel from the UK came into force . 
Flights to Budapest , Sofia , Bucharest and Gdansk were departing shortly before 10 pm and were all busy , with many travellers rushing to the airport to catch the final flights as it became clear during the day that borders were closing . 
Some were attempting to fly on complicated transit routes via eastern Europe , to get to destinations that had already closed borders , such as Belgium or France . 
Many were denied boarding as the regulations changed by the hour .
