The International Monetary Fund [ IMF ] on Friday approved a 42 month , US$370m loan program for conflict ravaged Afghanistan as it tries to deal with the coronavirus pandemic . 
The loan aims to help stabilise the country ’s economy , shore up its Covid 19 response and catalyse donor support , the IMF said in a statement . 
The government ’s economic program was set back by the pandemic , but Kabul has put in place policies to return to growth and reduce poverty , IMF deputy managing director Mitsuhiro Furusawa said in a statement . 
However , " should downside risks , including from the pandemic and the security situation , materialize , the recovery could falter and financing needs increase " , Furusawa said . 
Under the Extended Credit Facility the government will receive $ 115m immediately , with the rest coming in instalments following semi annual reviews of performance criteria covering economic policy and anti corruption efforts , the IMF said in a statement .
