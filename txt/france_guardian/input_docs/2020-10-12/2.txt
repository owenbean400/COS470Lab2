Ireland ’s chief medical officer has said he has not seen anywhere near enough evidence to suggest that Covid 19 cases have stabilised sufficiently in Dublin , a bellwether in deciding if nationwide restrictions are strict enough . 
Ireland ’s government rejected a call by health chiefs last week to enter a second national lockdown and have pinned their hopes on less severe restrictions showing signs of success in the capital city , where they were first imposed . 
The government banned indoor restaurant dining and advised against non essential travel in and out of Dublin on 18 September under the level 3 constraints that were rolled out across the country last week . 
Data on Monday showed that cases in Dublin have been broadly stable for the past week at 178.4 per 100,000 people , just above the national rate of 167.8 and lower than in eight of Ireland ’s 25 other counties . 
Health chief Tony Holohan told a news conference : We have seen some impact of the measures . 
The growth rate in Dublin has dropped , it ’s now at least lower than other parts of the country . 
We saw some stabilisation in the numbers last week , but in each of the last three days , we ’ve seen case numbers up again . 
I do not think we have anything like the kind of evidence that I would like to have to conclude that the situation in Dublin is sufficiently stable … I do not think we can conclude that we have turned a corner . 
Ireland ’s health chiefs will meet on Thursday to provide updated advice to the government , and Holohan said that if the level 3 measures are to make a difference , his team would like to start seeing some encouraging signs by then . 
In Northern Ireland , the devolved government will meet on Tuesday to consider new restrictions to slow a far more rapid growth in cases . 
Curbs there are currently not as strict as in Ireland or many parts of the UK .
