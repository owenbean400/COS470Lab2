Peru opened the ruins of Machu Picchu for a single Japanese tourist after he waited almost seven months to enter the Inca citadel , while trapped in the Andean country during the coronavirus outbreak . 
Jesse Takayama â€™s entry into the ruins came thanks to a special request he submitted while stranded since mid March in the town of Aguas Calientes , on the slopes of the mountains near the site , said the minister of culture Alejandro Neyra on Monday . 
" He had come to Peru with the dream of being able to enter , " Neyra said in a virtual press conference . 
" The Japanese citizen has entered together with our head of the park so that he can do this before returning to his country . " 
Takayama , his entry ticket on hand since March , entered the ruins of the citadel built more than 500 years ago on Saturday , and became the first visitor in seven months to be able to walk through the world heritage site . 
His original plan had been to spend only a few days in Peru to take in Machu Picchu . 
" This is so amazing ! 
Thank you ! " said Takayama in a video recorded on the top of Machu Picchu mountain . 
Minister Neyra said that in November the stone ruins of Machu Picchu will be reopened for national and foreign tourists , without specifying the date . 
The site will permit 30 % of its normal capacity of 675 people per day . 
" We are still in the middle of a pandemic , " Neyra said . 
" It will be done with all the necessary care . "
