Mexico ’s president , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , said he is not opposed to private companies buying coronavirus vaccines to distribute to patients who want to pay for the doses . 
But he noted there is not much existing supply and warned companies not to try to buy vaccines already promised to the Mexican government . 
" We are not opposed to commercialising the vaccine , to companies importing it and selling it to those who can pay , " López Obrador said . 
" The catch is the supply of vaccines in the world markets , because there still is not enough production . 
" We would be opposed if the ones we have under contract were to be given to a private company , that we would not permit and we would file a complaint , " he said . 
Mexico ’s medical safety commission must grant approval for any vaccine . 
López Obrador has been criticised by some for centralising vaccine purchases and distribution , and for putting the effort – like many programmes in his administration – in the hands of the military . 
The president has promised that vaccines will be free and available to everyone in Mexico , but so far the country has only received around 50,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine . 
To vaccinate 1.4 million healthcare workers — the first in line to get the shots — Mexico would need 2.8 million doses . 
The government is placing hopes on three vaccines now in or entering phase 3 trials in Mexico ; it announced Novavax Inc will be conducting part of its testing in Mexico . 
China ’s Can Sino and Johnson & amp ; 
Johnson ’s Janssen Pharmaceutical business have also been conducting trials in Mexico .
