A manager at a pork plant in the US who was among seven people fired for betting on how many workers would contract Covid 19 said the office pool was spontaneous fun and intended to boost morale . 
Don Merschbrock , former night manager at the Tyson plant in Waterloo , Iowa , told The Associated Press : " We really want to clear our names . 
" We actually worked very hard and took care of our team members well . " 
Tyson announced the terminations of the Waterloo managers on 16 December , weeks after the betting allegation surfaced in wrongful death lawsuits filed by the families of four workers who died of Covid 19 . 
Tyson said an investigation led by former US Attorney General Eric Holder found sufficient evidence to terminate those involved , saying their actions violated the company ’s values of respect and integrity . 
Merschbrock said managers were given the " impossible task " of maintaining production while implementing virus safety precautions . 
They had been working 12 hour days , six or seven days per week , he said . 
The office pool involved roughly $ 50 cash , which went to the winner who picked the correct percentage of workers testing positive for the virus , Merschbrock said . 
He added that those involved did not believe the pool violated company policy and thought the plant ’s positivity rate would be lower than the community rate due to their mitigation efforts . 
" It was a group of exhausted supervisors that had worked so hard and so smart to solve many unsolvable problems , " Merschbrock said . 
" It was simply something fun , kind of a morale boost for having put forth an incredible effort . 
There was never any malicious intent . 
It was never meant to disparage anyone . " 
A Tyson spokesman declined to comment on Merschbrock ’s comments .
