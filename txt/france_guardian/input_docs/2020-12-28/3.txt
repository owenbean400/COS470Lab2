Hundreds of British tourists have fled the Swiss ski resort of Verbier after being told they had to quarantine . 
More than 400 UK holidaymakers are believed to have been booked into accommodation before Christmas . 
Some reports say about half of those have left , while others state only about a dozen remain , after Swiss authorities ordered all people who had arrived in the country by plane from Britain since 14 December to quarantine for 10 days . 
Switzerland was one of more than 40 countries to ban flights from the UK over concerns about the new coronavirus variant , but introduced an exemption on 23 December to enable residents of both countries to return home . 
Health minister Alain Berset said the exodus of tourists was " obviously a problem " , adding : " There was an order to quarantine that has not been respected , " according to Sky News . 
But director of Verbier Tourism , Simon Wiget , told the broadcaster " it was not a night escape " and that people had used " the possibility " of following the exemption to be able to return to Britain . 
It is understood the Foreign , Commonwealth & amp ; 
Development Office ( FCDO ) has not received any requests for help from British nationals in Verbier . 
The FCDO website states : " On December 20 , Switzerland announced a general entry ban for all travellers from the UK , and suspended all flights between the UK and Switzerland . 
" On December 23 , the Swiss Government introduced an exemption to allow passenger flights to/from the UK from December 24 for the purpose of enabling residents of UK and Switzerland to return in both directions . " 
Hundreds of Britons headed to Swiss ski resorts , where many of the slopes remain open , unlike many of the country â€™s neighbours .
