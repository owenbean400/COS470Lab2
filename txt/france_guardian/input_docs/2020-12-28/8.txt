Cuba has announced it would allow fewer flights from the United States and several other countries beginning 1 January , due to a surge in coronavirus cases since opening its airports in November . 
Cubans living abroad and returning to visit , or returning from shopping trips , have spread the virus to family members and beyond by breaking quarantine , the government said . 
Mexico , Panama , the Bahamas , Haiti and the Dominican Republic are also on the list . 
The government did not say how many flights per day would be allowed . 
The health ministry reported 3,782 Covid 19 cases from 1 November to 23 December , of which it said 71.5 % were visitors or their direct contacts . 
The government said in a separate announcement that the famous Varadero beach resort had received 69,000 foreign tourists during the same period without an outbreak of the disease .
