Sick people in northern France occasionally leave garments in healing trees or " arbres à loques " in the hope of a cure , following a tradition that persists since pre Roman times . 
But recently , this tradition has been updated for the coronavirus age . 
" The new development in 2020 is COVID masks , " said Bertrand Bosio , who runs Nord Fantastique , a Facebook page devoted to the region ’s ancient sites and lore . 
Tied to the branches of the healing tree in Hasnon , southwest of Lille , surgical masks can be clearly seen among items of clothing that range from socks to underwear – often left , Bosio said , by people suffering from fertility problems . 
In another departure from ritual , the masks are hung " preventatively " , Bosio believes – or perhaps hopes – rather than by Covid 19 sufferers who ought to be self isolating . 
Known as rag trees in Ireland , one of several other countries where the practice survives , the arbres à loques show pagan and Christian influences . 
" What ’s interesting about this place is that the ritual is still very much alive in our times , " Bosio added . 
" People turn to the healing tree when medicine has reached its limits , and when science has let them down . "
