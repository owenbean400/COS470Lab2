France reported 2,524 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours , a new post lockdown daily record , but there was no strain on hospitals as the virus circulates mainly among younger people , the health minister said . 
The country â€™s cumulative total of cases now stands at 206,696 and the seven day moving average of new infections - which smoothes out daily data reporting irregularities - increased to 1,810 , the highest level since 24 April , when the epidemic was in full swing and France under strict lockdown . 
Despite the rise in infections , the number of people in hospital with Covid 19 continued to fall and was down by 121 to 4,891 , the first time it fell below 5,000 since 19 March . 
It had set a high of 32,292 on 14 April . 
The number of people in intensive care with coronavirus also continued its slide , down by 12 to 379 . 
Health minister Olivier Veran said that the number of infections that lead to serious complications was now much lower than in February March . 
" There are several explanations , notably the fact that patients diagnosed with Covid now are younger , 20 to 40 , and less fragile , and because older people continue to protect themselves well , " Veran said on France 2 television . 
He said the government would do all it could to avoid a new lockdown , and that schools are scheduled to open normally in September , albeit with the virus protection procedures . 
The government will also gradually ramp up police checks to ensure people wear face masks where it is mandatory and respect social distancing . 
The seven day moving average of daily new infections - which topped at 4,537 on 1 April - has now been above 1,000 for two weeks , with the infection rate increasing as millions of French people travel and social distancing rules are not always respected in busy areas . 
The daily death toll increased by 18 to 30,371 on Wednesday , compared to 14 on Tuesday and a seven day average of nine .
