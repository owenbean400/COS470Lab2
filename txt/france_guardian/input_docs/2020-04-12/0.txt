Police have caught a church in Paris holding a traditional Easter mass with dozens of worshippers , flouting the strict rules imposed to fight coronavirus , AFP reports . 
Religious services and all gatherings have been banned in France for the past month , but the traditional Saint Nicolas du Chardonnet Catholic church in the centre of Paris held an Easter mass late on Saturday , police sources said . 
The priest was warned and booked for not respecting the confinement rules , the source said . 
This would have made him liable for a € 200 ( £ 176 ) fine . 
Police had been tipped off by local residents who had heard music coming from the church in the fifth arrondissement in the heart of the French capital .
