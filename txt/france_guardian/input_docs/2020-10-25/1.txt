Israel will begin human trials for a potential Covid 19 vaccine developed by a research institute overseen by the Defence Ministry on 1 November after receiving regulatory approval . 
The Israel Institute for Biological Research ( IIBR ) began animal trials for its " Bri Life " vaccine in March . 
The health ministry and an oversight committee have now given the green light to take it to the next stage . 
Eighty volunteers aged between 18 and 55 will be monitored for three weeks to see if virus antibodies develop , the ministry said in a statement . 
A second phase , expected to begin in December , will involve 960 people over the age of 18 , Reuters reports . 
Should those succeed , a third , large scale phase with 30,000 volunteers is scheduled for April or May 2021 . 
If successful , the vaccine may then be approved for mass use . 
The vaccine , the ministry said , has already tested well on a number of animal models and the IIBR has produced more than 25,000 doses for the first and second phases of the clinical trials . 
" Our final goal is 15 million rations for the residents of the State of Israel and for our close neighbours , " said IIBR director Shmuel Shapira . 
There are no internationally approved vaccines yet , but several are in advanced trials , including from Pfizer Inc , Johnson & amp ; 
Johnson , Astra Zeneca Plc and Moderna . 
Israel , with a population of 9 million , has begun easing a second nationwide coronavirus lockdown after a steady decline in the rate of daily infections . 
The country saw 692 new cases on Saturday - down from a peak of more than 9,000 several weeks ago . 
It has reported 2,372 deaths from the pandemic .
