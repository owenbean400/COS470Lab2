Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borissov said on Sunday he had a " general malaise " after testing positive for coronavirus and would stay at home for now for any treatment , as recommended by his doctors . 
The government press office said Borissov was able to carry out his duties and was in constant contact with his ministers as the Balkan country grapples with a spike in new coronavirus infections and daily anti government protests since July , Reuters reports . 
Borissov had self isolated late on Friday after he was informed that a deputy minister who he had been in contact with five days ago had tested positive . 
Health authorities lifted Borissov ’s quarantine late on Saturday after two negative results from coronavirus tests , but then he tested positive on Sunday . 
" After two PCR tests , as of today I am positive with Covid 19 , " the 61 year old said on Facebook . 
" I have a general malaise . 
For the moment , on the doctors ’ discretion , I remain on home treatment . " 
It was not immediately clear if he was already receiving a specific treatment . 
He said he had postponed all meetings and planned public appearances for the coming days . 
In a response to wishes for a speedy recovery from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Twitter , Borissov wrote back : " Thank you . 
I hope to recover soon . 
And in the meantime I will strictly follow the orders of the health authorities . "
