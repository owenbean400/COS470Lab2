Turkish Airlines will be putting foreign national pilots on unpaid leave to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its finances , Bloomberg reported on Sunday . 
Turkey â€™s national carrier informed some of its foreign crew staff by email that they are to go on leave from 1 November , and that the decision would be reviewed after six months . 
It was not immediately clear how many pilots will be affected , and whether Turkish nationals would escape the cost saving measure . 
A spokesman for Turk Hava Yollari AO , as the airline is officially known , declined to comment . 
The company reported a loss of 2.23bn liras ( $ 280m ) in the second quarter , with passenger numbers down by almost two thirds this year .
