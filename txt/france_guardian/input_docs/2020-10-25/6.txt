Australia ’s coronavirus hot spot of Victoria on Monday reported zero cases of the new coronavirus for the first time since June , a day after the state delayed the easing of restrictions because of a fresh outbreak in Melbourne ’s northern suburbs . 
The 5 million residents of Melbourne , Victoria ’s state capital , have been placed under a hard lockdown since July to contain the spread of the virus , shutting down businesses and restricting people ’s movements . 
The city was just emerging from a second wave after the lockdown helped bring down daily cases to single digits in recent days from a peak of 700 in early August . 
But clusters in five suburbs had sparked fears of a new outbreak . 
Australia has so far recorded just over 27,500 coronavirus infections , far fewer than many other developed countries . 
Victoria , which accounts for more than 90 % of the 905 deaths nationally , did not record any new deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours .
