Britain is urgently looking at ways to reduce the 14 day quarantine period which applies to some arriving passengers , transport minister Grant Shapps has said , adding that a mix of Covid 19 testing and self isolation was promising . 
Arrivals from countries like France , Spain and the US must self isolate for 14 days on arrival in Britain , a restriction which airlines say is crushing travel demand . 
Shapps said he was setting up a Global Travel Taskforce to open up international travel . 
" The overall aim of the Taskforce will be to consider what steps the government can take ... to enable the safe and sustainable recovery of international travel , " he added in a statement . 
It would report back no later than early November . 
In July , Britain changed its policy from a blanket quarantine to one which established " travel corridors " to countries with low infection rates . 
But with cases on the rise in several places , the list of countries on the quarantine exemption list is dwindling , and the travel industry has warned it faces an existential crisis unless the policy is changed again . 
" My ministerial colleagues and I have agreed that a regime , based on a single test , provided by the private sector and at the cost of the passenger after a period of self isolation , could achieve our objective , " Shapps said . 
Virgin Atlantic , easy Jet , London â€™s Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group said that a test of a passenger after five days should be the starting point of proposals in a joint statement . 
But airline body IATA said that 80 % of travellers said they would not fly at all if any quarantine were in place . 
" The proposals on the table do not go as far as we had hoped , " IATA said . 
" A reduction in the length of quarantine is the very minimum needed to restart travel demand . "
