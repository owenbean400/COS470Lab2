Thousands of Israelis demonstrated again on Saturday in Jerusalem , in a continuation of summer long weekend rallies demanding the resignation of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who faces a corruption trial and accusations of mishandling the coronavirus crisis . 
Smaller protests also took place in other parts of Israel , including overpasses and outside Netanyahu ’s private house in the upscale town of Caesaria , the Associated Press reports . 
Netanyahu ’s governing coalition temporarily survived collapse this week after an agreement with alternate prime minister Benny Gantz , his rival and main coalition partner , to delay a budget vote until December . 
If the two coalition partners had failed to agree on delaying the budget ’s approval , the government would have collapsed and Israel would have gone to its fourth general elections in less than two years . 
The coronavirus crisis is fuelling the protest movement . 
After controlling the virus in its first stages in the spring , Israel rushed to reopen the economy in May , leading to a spike in infections . 
Israel ’s confirmed cases now exceed 113,000 and the death toll is approaching 1,000 . 
Business owners , day to day workers and smaller , vulnerable entrepreneurs who were hard hit by lockdown measures built a core group of protesters taking part in anti Netanyahu demonstrations , as the unemployment rate hovers above 20 % .
