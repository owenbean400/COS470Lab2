Far right extremists tried to storm the German parliament building Saturday following a protest against the country ’s pandemic restrictions , but were intercepted by police and forcibly removed . 
The incident occurred after a daylong demonstration by tens of thousands of people opposed to the wearing of masks and other government measures intended to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
Police ordered the protesters to disband halfway through their march around Berlin after participants refused to observe social distancing rules , but a rally near the capital ’s iconic Brandenburg Gate took place as planned . 
Footage of the incident showed hundreds of people , some waving the flag of the German Reich of 1871-1918 and other far right banners , running toward the Reichstag building and up the stairs . 
Police confirmed on Twitter that several people had broken through a cordon in front of Parliament and entered the staircase of the Reichstag building , but not the building itself . 
" Stones and bottles were thrown at our colleagues , " police said . 
" Force had to be used to push them back . "
