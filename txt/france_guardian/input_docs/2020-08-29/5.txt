Countries across the world have been " selfish " in their handling of the coronavirus pandemic , Pascal Lamy , former head of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , said at a conference in the Tyrolean mountain village Alpbach . 
Many countries did not cooperate with each other despite medical necessity , the former EU commissioner said , according to the Standard newspaper . 
Lamy pondered the question of how the international community will act if a reliable vaccine becomes available , and expressed fears that poorer countries would lose out . 
Lamy emphasised that the pandemic had triggered the biggest economic crisis since the Second World War , and warned that problems of unequal distribution would be exacerbated by Covid in the future . 
" We have to expect that the world will be more unequal and more divided , " he said . 
" The world will be the same again , but worse . " 
The European Forum Alpbach is an interdisciplinary platform for science , politics , business and culture and hosts an annual conference aiming to discuss the relevant socio political questions of our time .
