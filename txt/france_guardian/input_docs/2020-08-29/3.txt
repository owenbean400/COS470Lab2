Shiite Muslims are observing the solemn holy day of Ashoura that they typically mark with large , mournful gatherings , in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Ashoura commemorates the seventh century killing of Imam Hussein , the grandson of the prophet Muhammad , in the Battle of Karbala in present day Iraq with the army of then caliph Yazid , to whom Hussein had refused to pledge allegiance . 
The Day of Ashoura falls on the 10th of the Islamic month of Muharram and is preceded by days of commemorations and remembrance . 
The public expressions of communal mourning are generally associated with Shiites . 
For many Sunnis , Ashoura is a remembrance of more than one event , including the Moses led exodus from Egypt . 
In Iraq , pilgrims ordinarily converge on the holy city of Karbala , site of the battle and home to a shrine to Imam Hussein . 
But with the pandemic , Iraq â€™s top Shiite cleric , grand ayatollah Ali al Sistani , encouraged people to observe the mourning in other ways such as watching online or televised commemorations from home , the Associated Press reports . 
Those attending public commemorations must adhere to health guidelines , including social distancing and wearing masks , with caps on the number of participants in accordance with the local regulations of different countries , a statement from his office said .
