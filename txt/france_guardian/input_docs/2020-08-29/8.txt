Costa Rica ’s government said on Saturday it has requested $ 1.75bn ( £ 1.31bn ) in financial assistance over three years from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as the Central American nation ’s economy has been reeling from the coronavirus pandemic . 
On 12 July , Costa Rican president Carlos Alvarado said his administration would begin negotiations with the IMF to access a financial aid package to help offset the economic blow from Covid 19 . 
Details about the size of the aid package were not disclosed at the time . 
In a letter dated 29 August and addressed to IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva , Costa Rica ’s central bank president Rodrigo Cubero and finance minister Elian Villegas requested financial aid " in the form of a 3 year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility , " equivalent to $ 1.75bn . " Despite our proactive policy efforts , the combined impact of the global shock and domestic containment measures on our country ’s balance of payments and fiscal account is proving much sharper and protracted than expected , amid a resurgence in Covid 19 cases and a deeper contraction than initially envisaged , " the letter said , according to Reuters . 
The financial aid aims to offset diminishing government revenue as the 2020 fiscal deficit looks set to exceed 9 % of the gross domestic product , and the central bank ’s debt is predicted to reach nearly 70 % of GDP , according to the letter . 
The central bank forecasts Costa Rica ’s economy to contract by 5 % in 2020 , with only a gradual recovery over the medium term .
