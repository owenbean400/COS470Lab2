Care bosses have accused the British government of failing to deliver its promise of regular coronavirus testing for staff and residents of all care homes , nearly six months after the UK entered lockdown . 
Prof Martin Green , the chief executive of Care England , said he had repeatedly asked ministers and senior officials to enact a pledge by Matt Hancock , the health secretary , on 8 June that " every care home " in England would receive regular testing for the virus . 
Green said there were many parts of the UK where testing was not happening , preventing homes from allowing visits by relatives .
