Prospective brides in England whose wedding receptions have been scuppered by new social distancing restrictions have turned to social media to vent their disappointment and fury at the short notice with which the new rules were implemented . 
Using the hashtag # whataboutweddings on Twitter , affected brides to be and people working in the wedding industry are lambasting the last minute rule change , with many pointing out it seems unfair to ban wedding receptions of up to 30 people while regular parties are allowed to turn up in the same numbers at the same venues , such as pubs or restaurants , and air travel is permitted . 
People going back and forth to Spain and France ? 
Fine . 
Busy restaurant ? 
Fine . 
Pub ? 
Go ahead . 
Tube to work ? 
Absolutely . 
Small wedding with less than 30 guests ? 
No . 
Could it go ahead if I hold it in a pub and pretend not to know my guests ? 
# whataboutweddings # pleaseexplain Bars = Yes Drinks reception = No Meal out = yes wedding breakfast = No Air travel = Yes gathering of 30 = No Public transport = yes gathering of 30 = No Sit amongst 100 strangers in restaurant = yes . 
Sit amongst 30 family members = No#whataboutweddings where is the logic in this Oh ... 
But this is fine ? ! ? 
# whataboutweddings On Friday , prime minister Boris Johnson announced with less than 24 hours â€™ notice that the decision to allow wedding receptions with up to 30 people from Saturday would be reversed .
