Peru has secured enough coronavirus vaccine to give nearly three quarters of its population at least one dose when the immunization is available , a hopeful development for a nation with one of the highest COVID 19 death rates in the world , reports Reuters . 
The agreements announced on Friday with Pfizer Inc and global vaccine distribution program COVAX will provide 23.1 million doses for a population of 31.9 million . 
Some vaccine regimes will require two doses . 
The Peruvian Ministry of Health said it had signed a binding agreement with Pfizer for the purchase of 9.9 million doses of its vaccine which is in testing . 
Another 13.2 million doses will be bought through COVAX , which is led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization and aimed at promoting equitable access . 
COVAX has signed agreements to buy vaccines from French drugmaker Sanofi , Britain ’s Glaxo Smith Kline , Astra Zeneca and Novavax . 
Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti said this week that she expects vaccines to arrive in Peru in the first quarter of 2021 before general elections on April 11 , and vaccines will likely be administered in voting centers . 
China ’s Sinopharm and the United States ’ Johnson & amp ; 
Johnson are conducting trials of their vaccines in the country , potentially allowing Peru to buy doses at a discount , the ministry of health said .
