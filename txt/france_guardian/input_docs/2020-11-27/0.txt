Covid grief is worse than other types of grief , according to the first findings of UK wide research into how people have coped with the deaths of loved ones during the pandemic . 
Family and friends bereaved by coronavirus experienced " greatly increased negative experiences " and showed higher grief and support needs compared to people suffering the loss of loved ones from other illnesses , including cancer , researchers at Cardiff and Bristol universities found . 
Examining more than 500 deaths since mid March , around half from Covid , they discovered that Covid bereaved people were less likely to have been able to say goodbye to loved ones , less likely to have visited them prior to death and less likely to have had contact with friends and family after their bereavement . 
There have been more than 70,000 excess deaths in the UK during the pandemic , adding to an estimated 450,000 which would have normally occurred over the nine months , the report â€™s authors said . 
On the basis that a typical person dying leaves five people bereaved , they estimate 2.6 million people have been bereaved in the UK " at a time of profound disruption to our social support networks as well as intense pressure on health and social care " . 
The study , which will continue gathering evidence until the end of December , found 70 % of bereaved people whose loved one died of a confirmed Covid 19 infection had limited contact with them in the last days of their life , 85 % were unable to say goodbye as they would have liked , and 75 % experienced social isolation and loneliness . 
By contrast 43 % of people whose loved ones died of cancer over the same period had limited contact , 39 % were unable to say proper goodbyes and 63 % experienced loneliness .
