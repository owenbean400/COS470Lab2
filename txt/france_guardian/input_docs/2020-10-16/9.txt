Covid 19 testing will be increased in a south west Sydney suburb after a positive case at Oran Park high school and a family and staff member tested positive at the suburb ’s Great Beginnings childcare centre . 
Saturday sport has been cancelled for the high school , the NSW education department says , and authorities have directed all staff and pupils to self isolate . 
Classrooms will be deep cleaned . 
The childcare centre cases are linked to another case confirmed on Tuesday , which prompted the centre ’s lockdown . 
All staff and children who attended the centre between October 2 and Tuesday have been told to get tested and self isolate for a fortnight . 
This weekend brings eased restrictions in NSW for outdoor venues , with up to 500 people allowed to attend open air concerts so long as they stay seated and four metres apart . 
Limits on outdoor dining venues have also been relaxed , allowing one patron per two square metres with venues to use an electronic QR code to record contact details .
