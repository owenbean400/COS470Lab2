Just back to the United States , momentarily . 
I mentioned a little earlier the record surges of Covid 19 in states like Wisconsin , which is now recording its highest levels of cases , hospitalisations , and deaths . 
Dr Agnes Kresch , an infectious diseases physician in Green Bay , Wisconsin , said the numbers there are " unbelievable " . 
She told CNN that the Covid 19 surge is threatening to overwhelm Green Bay hospitals . 
Kresch blames " human behaviour " for the record highs . 
For the city of Green Bay we have over 130 people hospitalised just with coronavirus , and the real issue is where does that leave the rest of the patients who are still coming in with their strokes and heart attacks . 
How do we find space for them ? 
" The numbers are really unbelievable . 
We â€™ve never seen numbers quite this high . 
Our hospitals are at near capacity , " says Green Bay , Wisconsin , infectious disease physician Dr . Agnes Kresch as the state sees a surge in Covid 19 cases .
