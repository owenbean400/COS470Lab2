Secondary schools in local lockdown areas in England could have to use a " rota system " to limit the number of teenagers attending at any one time , with teachers and pupils required to wear face coverings in communal areas , according to new government guidance . 
The staggered approach will limit the amount of people students come into contact with , and will help break transmission chains by giving enough time at home for symptoms to become apparent , said the Department for Education . 
The guidance , issued on Friday ahead of schools in England reopening for autumn term next week , said schools should base their plans on a four tier system , and the extra measures for secondary schools should be introduced at the second tier . 
It said : " Schools should ideally operate a rota system that means pupils spend two weeks on site followed by two weeks at home . 
" This allows more than sufficient time for symptoms to present themselves and for pupils to self isolate and avoid transmitting the virus to others . 
" However , schools can choose to operate a one week rota ( so , five days on site , followed by nine days at home ) if this is necessary for the effective delivery of the curriculum . "
