Hi all , it ’s Naaman Zhou here , taking over the blog from my colleague Nadeem Badshah . 
As we ’ve just heard , Victoria has recorded 94 new cases of Covid 19 – the lowest daily increase in 8 weeks . 
Victorians are celebrating the return to " double digits " , but with caution . 
Health authorities are due to give a press conference later today .
