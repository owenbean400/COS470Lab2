Nationwide restrictions cannot be ruled out should England see a spike in coronavirus cases this winter , the health secretary has warned . 
Matt Hancock said countries in others parts of the world were already experiencing a second wave , adding it was " a very serious threat " . 
But he told the Times the UK was managing to keep the number of new cases " flat " through the test and trace system and local lockdowns . 
Describing the worst case scenario , he said the UK could be battling bad flu and a growth in coronavirus as people spend more time indoors . 
He added : " Cases go up again , and we have to use very extensive local lockdowns or take further national action . 
" We do not rule that out , but we do not want to see it . "
