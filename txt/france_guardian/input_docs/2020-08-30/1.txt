Not all classrooms in France can safely reopen on Tuesday , the country ’s education minister acknowledged on Sunday , as a persistent rise in coronavirus infections jeopardises the government ’s push to get 12.9 million schoolchildren back into class this week . 
Like many governments around the world , including the UK , France wants to reopen all schools on Tuesday to reduce the learning gaps between rich and poor students that were worsened by the virus lockdown this spring , and to get parents back to work and revive the ailing economy , the Associated Press reports . 
With several thousand new infections now reported in France every day , Jean Michel Blanquer , the education minister , told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper that some classes will remain closed when the nationwide reopening begins on Tuesday , but as few as possible . 
With less than 48 hours to go before the first French school bells ring , he said openings and closures were being decided by a day by day analysis based on the health situation of each territory . 
French doctors published an appeal on Saturday saying that the government ’s anti virus measures for schools are not strict enough . 
They urged masks for children as young as six and a mix of online and in person schooling . 
Currently , French schools are set to resume largely as normal , but with masks required all day for everyone 11 and over and some restrictions on movements and gatherings . 
In contrast , other European countries like Denmark and many school districts in the US are undergoing a full school day revamp that includes smaller classes , more teachers , more separation between students and classes and a mix of in class and online learning .
