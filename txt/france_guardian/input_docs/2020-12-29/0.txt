Members of the armed forces will be drafted in to support coronavirus testing operations for thousands of school and college students in England , the Ministry of Defence ( Mo D ) has announced . 
The Mo D said 1,500 military personnel would be deployed to ensure that testing systems were up and running by the time pupils returned for the new term in January . 
The majority of the personnel will form local response teams , providing support and phone advice to institutions needing guidance on the testing process and setup of the testing facilities . 
Students will swab themselves in the vast majority of cases , under the supervision of a school staff member or volunteer who has been trained for the role , and teachers are not expected to take a role in the testing process . 
The defence secretary , Ben Wallace , said : " The UK armed forces are stepping up once again this holiday . 
" They â€™ll share considerable experience of testing across the country and the successful school pilots conducted this autumn . 
" We are grateful for the professionalism and commitment they and our colleagues in teaching are showing to get students back into the classroom and on with their education . "
