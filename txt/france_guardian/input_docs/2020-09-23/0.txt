France ’s health minister has unveiled a map of coronavirus " danger zones " around the country , with bars and restaurants closed from Saturday in Marseille . 
Olivier Véran told a news conference the country would be divided into zones by alert level with Marseille , the second largest city , and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe for now the only two areas put on the " maximum " alert level . 
Paris and its suburbs along with Lille , Toulouse and six other cities were declared " reinforced danger zones " , Véran added . 
" Should the sanitary situation worsen further in those areas , then a state of health emergency would be put in place " , the minister said . 
Like other European countries where the infection rate has soared in the past month , France has been gradually tightening limits on public and private gatherings locally , hoping it will be enough to contain the disease and avoid a second national lockdown . 
After a summer lull , president Emmanuel Macron ’s government has been keen to let local authorities adopt measures locally depending on the severity of Covid 19 outbreaks , rather than taking broad measures from the central government in Paris . 
In Paris and the other cities now labelled " reinforced danger zones " , attendance at major events will be limited to 1,000 people from the 5,000 allowed now , pre planned events such as student parties will be banned , and bars and restaurants will have to close at 10pm at the latest . 
Two government sources said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo had strongly resisted restrictions on the opening hours of bars and cafes in the capital , arguing that this would be economically devastating for the sector . 
Among other measures , there will be a ban on public gatherings of more than 10 people and , in " maximum " alert level areas like Marseille , bars and restaurants will be closed from Saturday .
