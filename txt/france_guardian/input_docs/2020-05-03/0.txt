France ’s state supported ‘ Stop COVID ’ contact tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown , a government minister has said . 
Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O , a member of President Emmanuel Macron ’s inner circle , presented the app as a key element of France ’s strategy to stave off the coronavirus as authorities grapple with the prospect of mass testing . 
" There ’s nothing magical about this app , but it ’s not technological coquetry either , " O wrote on online publishing platform Medium . 
" It ’s only useful if it ’s integrated into a global health system . " 
Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk of one person infecting another , helping to isolate those who could spread the disease .
