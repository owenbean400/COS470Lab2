French health authorities have reported 6,158 new Covid 19 infections over the past 24 hours , sharply down from Saturday ’s record high since large scale testing began of 10,561 and Sunday ’s tally of 7,183 . 
The Monday figure always tends to dip as there are fewer tests conducted on Sundays . 
The seven day moving average of new infections , which smoothes out reporting irregularities , stood at 8,324 , a record for a 28th day in a row , versus a low of 272 on 27 May , two weeks after the country ended its two month long lockdown . 
The number of people in France who have died rose by 34 to 30,950 . 
The cumulative number of cases now totals 387,252 . 
It comes as authorities in Bordeaux and Marseille announced strict new measures to limit public gatherings in an effort to rein in a rapid surge in Covid 19 cases that risks overwhelming the two cities ’ hospitals . 
The prime minister , Jean Castex , on Friday announced no new national restrictions and instead delegated the task to regional officials and health authorities . 
The country was not uniformly affected and they were better placed to act , he said .
