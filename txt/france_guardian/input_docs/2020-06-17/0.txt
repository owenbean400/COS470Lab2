France ’s death toll rose by 28 to 29,575 on Wednesday , a figure more in line with the current trend after a spike in deaths on Tuesday due to the inclusion of weekly data for nursing homes . 
Yet the number of new confirmed cases was at a four day high of 458 , at 158,174 , and slightly above the daily average of 434 seen over the last seven days . 
On Tuesday , the death toll was up by 111 but that figure included 73 fatalities in nursing homes . 
If only hospital deaths are taken into account , the average daily increase stands at 26 . 
France ’s health ministry said that the number of people in hospital fell by 268 to 10,267 and the number of people in intensive care fell by 48 to 772 . 
Both numbers have been on a downtrend for about 10 weeks .
