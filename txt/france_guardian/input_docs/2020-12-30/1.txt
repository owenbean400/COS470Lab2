California has announced its first confirmed case of the new more contagious variant of coronavirus which was discovered in the UK earlier this month . 
Governor Gavin Newsom announced the infection found in Southern California during an online conversation with Dr . Anthony Fauci , head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
I do not think Californians should think that this is odd . 
It â€™s to be expected , " Fauci said . 
Newsom did not provide any other details about the person who was infected . 
The first person in the U.S . known to be infected with the variant was identified Wednesday as a Colorado National Guardsman who had been sent to help out at a nursing home struggling with an outbreak . 
Health officials said a second Guard member may also have contracted the new variant .
