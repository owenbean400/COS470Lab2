A Baltimore police detective is facing criminal charges after prosecutors say he slammed to the ground a man who refused to wear a face mask inside a grocery store . 
Prosecutors said Detective Andre Pringle was stationed at a grocery store in West Baltimore in spring when 25 year old Brandon Walker entered the store with a mask on top of his head but not covering his face , the Baltimore Sun reports . 
Prosecutors say Walker yelled and cursed Pringle as he escorted him outside of the store . 
Once outside , Pringle slammed Walker to the ground face first , prosecutors said .
