Honours for people tackling the Covid 19 pandemic will be a recurring theme in the New Year and Birthday Honours list for many years as the pandemic " evolves " , the Cabinet Office in the UK said . 
There were 231 people named in the New Year honours - 18.6 % of the total - for their services to the coronavirus crisis . 
Dame Barbara Monroe said that the true figure was likely to be much higher , as many of the nominations has been submitted before the start of the pandemic . 
On the list were 123 health and social care workers , 10 % of the whole list , chosen from a pool of many hundreds of nominations to the health committee . 
It builds on a trend set by the Birthday Honours , where 14 % of the total were health and social care workers .
