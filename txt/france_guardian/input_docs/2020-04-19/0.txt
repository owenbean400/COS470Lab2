Hello , this is Alison Rourke picking up our live coverage of coronavirus as Donald Trump gives his daily White House briefing . 
The president began the briefing by saying a deal with the Democrats is " close " on the latest relief bill for small businesses and workers ... and could be resolved as soon as tomorrow . 
He says 4.18 million Americans have been tested for the coronavirus . 
" That ’s a record anywhere in the world , " Trump says . 
" More total tests than all the following nations combined : France , the United Kingdom , South Korea , Japan , Singapore , India , Austria , Australia , Sweden and Canada . " 
Trump says there is a " tremendous capacity " for testing before showing off a medical swab , likening it to a Q tip . 
" We have ordered a lot of them , " he said , but notes that some states " do not know where they are " . 
Then a return to what ’s become a recurring motif over the past few days : " We are now the king of ventilators , " he says . 
" We have so many ventilators . "
