The Democratic presidential nominee , Joe Biden , has accused president Donald Trump of betraying the American people , saying he knowingly lied about the deadliness of the coronavirus in what amounted to a " dereliction " of his duty . 
According to newly released recordings of interviews done in February for a book by the journalist Bob Woodward , Trump acknowledged he knew how deadly and contagious the coronavirus was but played it down because he did not want to create a panic . 
With weeks remaining until the 3 November presidential election , the news about Trump ’s comments again focused attention on the Republican president ’s efforts to battle Covid 19 , which Democrats say have been too little , too late . 
" He knew , and purposefully played it down . 
Worse , he lied to the American people , " Biden said in a speech in Michigan . 
He was visiting the battleground state , home to the US auto industry , to promote a new proposal to tax companies that move US jobs overseas . 
And while this deadly disease ripped through our nation , he failed to do his job on purpose . 
It was a life and death betrayal of the American people . 
It ’s a dereliction of duty , a disgrace . 
Biden and Trump are ramping up travel in the final sprint to the election during a pandemic that has made waging a traditional campaign all but impossible . 
The US has recorded the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world . 
Deaths topped 190,000 on Wednesday along with a rise in new cases in the midwest , with states such as Iowa and South Dakota emerging as new hotspots in the past few weeks .
