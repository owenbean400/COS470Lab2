" Covid secure " marshals will be recruited to help in the enforcement of new stricter rules on social gatherings , the British prime minister has said . 
The new roles are part of a series of measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus , with people in England banned from meeting in groups of more than six from Monday . 
It is unclear specifically what role the new marshals will perform and what powers they will have . 
But the prime minister said they will be based in town and city centres , where there are large numbers of bars and restaurants which will be restricted on group sizes from next week . 
Speaking at a press conference confirming the new rules on Wednesday , Boris Johnson said : Fines will be levied against hospitality venues that fail to ensure that their premises remain Covid secure . 
We will boost the local enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing Covid secure marshals to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres , and by setting up a register of environmental health officers that local authorities can draw upon for support . 
The new rules on socialising in England come as ministers try to tackle the rising number of coronavirus cases across the UK . 
Cases have climbed from 12.5 per 100,000 people to 19.7 per 100,000 in the UK in the last week - with a particular rise in infections among young people . 
Infections are most prevalent among the 19 to 21 year old age group , with 54 cases per 100,000 people .
