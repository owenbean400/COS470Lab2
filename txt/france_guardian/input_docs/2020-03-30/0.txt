Survivors of domestic violence will be housed in hotel rooms paid for by the state , the French gender equality minister , Marlène Schiappa , says . 
She has announced that pop up counselling centres will also be set up after figures showed the number of abuse cases has soared during the first week of the country ’s lockdown . 
Schiappa has said about 20 such centres will open in shops around the country so women could drop in for help while getting groceries , according to a report by the Thomson Reuters Foundation . 
The French government also announced an extra € 1m ( about £ 890,000 ) for anti domestic abuse organisations to help them respond to increased demand for services .
