Tesco has introduced buying limits on items including toilet roll , eggs , rice , soap and handwash . 
Customers at the supermarket are now limited to one item per person of toilet roll , and up to three products of eggs , rice , soap and handwash . 
It is understood the extra limits are pre emptive measures to help smooth demand in the coming weeks , rather than a reaction to shortages or a change in buying behaviour . 
They are on top of a three item limit on essential items such as flour , dried pasta and anti bacterial wipes which has been in place for several months . 
On Monday supermarkets and wholesalers warned of shortages of lettuce , broccoli and citrus fruit around Christmas as thousands of lorries were stranded in Kent after France closed its borders to the UK . 
" If nothing changes , we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce , some salad leaves , cauliflowers , broccoli and citrus fruit – all of which are imported from the continent at this time of year , " a Sainsbury ’s spokesperson said . 
Tesco previously introduced a buying cap on toilet roll in November in anticipation of a repeat of the panic buying that took place in March , and has encouraged customers to " shop as normal " , saying it had plenty of food up to 25 December .
