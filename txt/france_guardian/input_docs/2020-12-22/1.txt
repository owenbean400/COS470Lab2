A mass testing programme for HGV drivers will get under way to alleviate congestion at ports after an agreement was reached to reopen the border between France and the UK , the Department for Transport said . 
Transport secretary Grant Shapps said : I am pleased that we have made this important progress with our French counterparts this evening . 
This protocol will see the French border reopen to those travelling for urgent reasons , provided they have a certified negative Covid test . 
We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports . 
The protocol agreed with the French government will be reviewed on 31 December but could run until 6 January , the Df T said . 
All lorry drivers , irrespective of nationality , will require a lateral flow test , which can provide results in about 30 minutes . 
The French government will also carry out sample testing on incoming freight to the UK , the Df T said . 
Shapps said lateral flow tests could be used to test those able to cross the French border . 
Speaking to BBC News , he said : " Any passengers going to France – and at the moment I ’m afraid that ’s mostly French citizens returning and one or two other exceptions – will need a lateral flow , or a PCR test , but a test within the 72 hour period before they go to France . 
" Of course , anyone coming this way – and again we ’re not encouraging anybody to travel right now – will need to follow our rules which are self isolation for 10 days or a test to release after five days . "
