France will receive around 1.16m Covid 19 vaccine doses by year end , prime minister Jean Castex said , adding another 2.3m will arrive in the next two months . 
The delivery of some 3.5m doses will inoculate around 1.7 million people , with priority given to the elderly , the vulnerable and carers . 
Covid vaccines are administered in two doses over several weeks . 
The government will " be much more transparent in this phase of the epidemic â€™s management , " the premier pledged after authorities came under fire over the distribution of tests and masks earlier in the year . 
" We should not miss this turn in the road " to inoculate people , he said . 
Giving a breakdown , Castex said France will receive around 1.16m doses by the end of the year , another 677,000 doses around 5-6 January , and around 1.6m doses in February . 
France has ordered a total of around 200m doses , which would be enough to inoculate 100 million people . 
The country has a population of just under 70 million .
