Nigerian doctors in state hospitals have suspended their strike over pay , a shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate facilities , union leaders said on Thursday . 
The strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors ( NARD ) , which represents around 40 % of the west African country ’s medics , started on Monday . 
In a break from previous industrial action , this strike had included doctors treating coronavirus patients . 
The union ’s president said the strike was called off to give the government time to meet its demands . 
" The NEC ( National Executive Council ) of the association has resolved that the strike be suspended because nobody has received a dime anyway . 
But because we have received commitment from the government , " he said . 
" We always give them time to do what they want . 
We have asked them what time they want and they say two weeks . 
We are giving them the two weeks . " 
Doctors have complained about a shortage of beds and drugs in hospitals , as well as insufficient PPE . 
The union is also calling for unsettled wages to be paid , pay rises and life insurance coverage .
