Renters in England and Wales facing eviction have been offered a reprieve â€“ but only if they live in areas under local coronavirus lockdowns , Richard Booth reports . 
Robert Jenrick , the housing secretary , confirmed that court proceedings for evictions would restart in England and Wales on 21 September after being suspended early in the pandemic . 
But he said that if an area was in a local lockdown that included a restriction on gathering in homes , evictions would not be enforced by bailiffs .
