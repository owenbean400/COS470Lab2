A crown court judge has refused to extend the custody time limit for keeping a man in prison awaiting trial and accused the UK government of under funding the criminal justice system during the pandemic . 
Amid a growing backlog of cases , Judge Raynor at Woolwich crown court on Tuesday issued a highly critical 24 page ruling on the case of a 19 year old who has already been held for almost a year . 
He also contrasted the Ministry of Justice ’s " inadequate " efforts with the success of emergency courts in Spain and South Korea . 
It is the second time in the past month that the same judge has warned that he cannot repeatedly order defendants to remain behind bars if the justice system is failing to bring them to trial . 
At the weekend the government announced it would have to extend custody time limits to cope with delays caused by the partial shutdown of the courts during lockdown . 
The Mo J also pledged £ 80m , and an extra 1,600 court staff , and towards more emergency " Nightingale " courts .
