The Welsh government has added three more Greek islands to its quarantine list just hours before restrictions come into force . 
From 4am on Wednesday , travellers arriving in Wales from Santorini , Serifos and Tinos will have to self isolate for 14 days . 
Health minster Vaughan Gething said in a statement on Tuesday evening that he reviewed the latest assessments by the Joint Biosecurity Centre ( JBC ) before making the decision . 
This follows an announcement made on Thursday in which travellers arriving from Portugal , Gibraltar , French Polynesia as well as the Greek islands of Mykonos , Zakynthos , Lesvos , Paros , Antiparos and Crete were told to self isolate from 4am the following day . 
This latest measure comes after the Department for Transport announced quarantine measures for travellers arriving in England from the named Greek islands – with the exception of Paros and Antiparos – on Monday . 
This forms part of the government ’s new regional approach to quarantine policy , in which islands can be added or removed from the quarantine list should infection rates differ from their mainland countries .
