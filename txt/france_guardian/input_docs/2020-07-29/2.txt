French president Emmanuel Macron ’s popularity shot up by six points in July to reach the 50 % threshold in an opinion poll , after clinching a deal with other European leaders on an economic recovery package and reshuffling his government . 
In the Harris Interactive poll for LCI TV , half of respondents said they were confident in Macron ’s policies for France , only the second time since April 2018 the French president reached the 50 % mark . 
The poll was taken on 21-23 July , shortly after the 27 EU leaders agreed on a € 750bn stimulus that Macron said was " historic " and that should see France receive at least € 40bn in grants to help recovery from the novel coronavirus pandemic . 
Macron also changed his prime minister in early July and reshuffled his government . 
The new prime minister , Jean Castex , saw his first popularity rating stand at 56 % in the same poll , higher than the 51 % of his predecessor , Edouard Philippe .
