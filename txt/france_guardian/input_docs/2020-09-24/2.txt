The French Open will be able to welcome only 1,000 people a day , down from the 5,000 spectators it had hoped for , prime minister Jean Castex said . 
" We will apply at Roland Garros the same rules as elsewhere . 
We will go from 5,000 to 1,000 , " he said , clarifying that those figures included players , staff and organisers . 
With Covid 19 on the rise again in France , health minister Olivier VÃ©ran on Wednesday said that a maximum of 1,000 people would be allowed at major sports events starting on Monday , but it was unclear whether the Grand Slam tournament , which runs from 27 September - 11 October , would be included .
