The French government may be pushing for people to download its Covid 19 contact tracing app , but when asked whether he had done so , prime minister Jean Castex said he had not because he does not take the metro . 
The app was launched at the start of June to much fanfare from the government , but three months later only 2.4 million people out of a 67 million population have downloaded it Castex , who was forced to isolate earlier this month after being in contact with someone who had been tested positive for the virus , admitted he had not downloaded the app . 
" I push the French to do it , but I have not done it , I â€™ll be honest with you , " he said . 
When asked whether his attitude was , do as I say not as I do , Castex insisted he was not handing out lessons , but that in his job there was no need for the app . 
" Look at my role ! 
Sadly , carrying out my functions , it means I do not take the metro . 
STOP COVID is only interesting when you go on the metro or meet people , " he said . 
" I see less people . " 
Finance minister Bruno Le Maire this week tested positive for the virus and is in quarantine . 
According to a report from health authorities issued on 15 September , 700,000 people have already uninstalled the app and it has had less than 200 alerts for Covid 19 in that period .
