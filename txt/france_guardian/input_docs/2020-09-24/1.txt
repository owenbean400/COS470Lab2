France ’s prime minister has warned the government could be forced to reconfine areas if the number of Covid 19 cases does not improve in the coming weeks and defended tough restrictions taken on Wednesday . 
Jean Castex said on France 2 television : It ’s a race against time . 
The public must be attentive and prudent . 
If we do not act we could find ourselves in a situation similar to spring . 
When asked whether France was heading towards a new confinement , Castex said the government did not want to , but left the door open if the situation worsened . 
" It could mean reconfinement , " he said . 
" The measures we have taken are to anticipate . " 
The government ordered cafes and restaurants in Marseille to shut for two weeks and closed all gymnasiums from Saturday , after placing the city and surrounding region on the Mediterranean coast on the maximum alert level for the spread of the virus . 
Tougher measures were also announced in Paris and in 10 other cities , including closing cafes and restaurants at 10pm . 
The move has angered local politicians who fear the economic fallout and argue that the government has panicked in its decision making process . 
" The hour is serious and we must act . 
We have to hope that the virus wo not last 30 years and that we ’ll find a vaccine , " Castex said .
