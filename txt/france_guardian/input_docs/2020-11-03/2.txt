France ’s daily Covid 19 death toll rose by 854 on Tuesday , an increase unseen since 15 April , while the number of people hospitalised for the disease went up by more than a 1,000 for the fifth time in nine days . 
And if the number of new infections , at 36,330 , was sharply down versus Monday ’s all time high of 52,518 , the seven day moving average of additional cases , which evens out reporting irregularities , reached a record for a second day in a row , at 43,438 . 
France reinstated a one month national lockdown on Friday to try and contain the resurgence of the pandemic but it generally takes two weeks for restrictive measures to have some effect . 
Authorities could nonetheless reimpose a night curfew on Paris and possibly the surrounding region in the coming days amid frustration that too many people are ignoring lockdown rules . 
The cumulative number of cases now totals 1,502,763 , the fifth highest in the world , and the death toll stands at 38,289 , the seventh highest globally . 
The sharp rise of the daily death toll is in part due to the fact the nursing homes fatalities are taken in account twice a week , on Tuesdays and on Fridays . 
The number of hospitalisations is now at 26,265 , a figure multiplied by almost six since an August 29 low of 4,530 and getting closer to the 14 April peak of 32,292 . 
France ’s first lockdown , imposed between 17 March and 11 May , had been decided to prevent the hospital system from being overwhelmed . 
The number of people in intensive care units increased by 148 , to 3,878 , a six month high but still some way from the 8 April peak of 7,148 .
