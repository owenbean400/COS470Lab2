MEPs wo not yet be returning to Strasbourg due to rising coronavirus infections in France , the European parliament speaker said , despite a plea by the French president , Emmanuel Macron . 
The European parliament has its headquarters in Strasbourg in eastern France , where MEPs usually based in Brussels travel every month for 12 plenary sessions a year . 
But these have been cancelled since March due to concerns over spreading the virus and transferred to Brussels , where the parliament also has a chamber . 
In September , " it was agreed that parliament would return to holding its regular part sessions in Strasbourg once the conditions allow " , the parliamentary speaker , David Sassoli , said in a statement . 
Hopes that a session would take place there on 5-8 October had been heightened by Macron , who insisted sessions be restored from next month . 
" I â€™m counting on you , " he wrote in a letter to Sassoli . 
But in a statement , the speaker said the transfer would not go ahead next week , " given the increased rate of transmission of the virus in France , including in Bas Rhin [ where Strasbourg is located ] , and in light of public health considerations " . 
He said he hoped " we will soon be able to return " but stressed the next session would take place in Brussels .
