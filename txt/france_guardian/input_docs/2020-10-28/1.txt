The French president , Emmanuel Macron , said Covid 19 is circulating more quickly than forecast and new measures are needed . 
He said it is predicted that by mid November all intensive care beds will be filled with Covid 19 cases and that France needs a sudden " brutal brake " on the transmission of the virus so doctors do not have to make choices between Covid cases and car accident cases , for example . 
Efforts made were useful but not enough ... 
The speed of the spread of virus has not been anticipated . 
Difficult measures have been taken ... but they are not enough to combat the second wave . 
We are overwhelmed by a second wave , that will be harder and more fatal than the first . 
" We have to admit , like our neighbours we are submerged by acceleration of the spread of the virus . 
We are all in Europe surprised by the speed of spread of the virus . 
We are overwhelmed by a second wave , that will be harder and more fatal than the first .
