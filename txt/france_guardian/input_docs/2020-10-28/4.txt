The new lockdown measures in France will stay in place until 1 December , President Macron said . 
He also said the situation would be reviewed in 15 days to see if shops could be reopened . 
The lockdown will be eased once daily new infections fall back to about 5,000 per day , he added . 
He concluded his speech by saying : We have to hold firm , stand shoulder to shoulder , we can only rise if we remain united . 
I count on each of you . 
I will be there , we will be there and we will get there all together . 
Vive la RÃ©publique and vive la France .
