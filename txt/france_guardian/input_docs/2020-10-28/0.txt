The French public is preparing for Emmanuel Macron ’s address at 8pm local time ( about 20 minutes from the timestamp on this post ) , in which he is expected to announce a raft of new measures to combat the spread of coronavirus . 
With many doctors calling for a nationwide lockdown , France 24 reports damning comments from Frederic Valletoux , president of the French Hospital Federation : The government did not take into account what the first wave was and did not learn all its lessons ... this wave will be much more devastating for the hospital system . 
Hospitals wo not manage if we do not take drastic measures . 
There is widespread speculation that Macron will decree a lockdown until the end of November . 
The measures are expected to be more flexible than earlier this year , when the French public faced some of the most draconian conditions in Europe . 
Still , they are still likely to be " unpopular " , a government official with knowledge of the measures told AFP . 
The head of Macron ’s LREM party , Stanislas Guerini , appeared to be preparing the ground for a shutdown when he told France 2 television that the country needed " strong measures , powerful measures ... and probably at a national level " . 
All will be clear when Macron speaks - we ’ll be following it live .
