President Macron has imposed a new nationwide lockdown in France as Covid 19 cases surge . 
The new measures echo the eight week lockdown that France enforced in the spring , when hospitalisations and deaths caused by Covid 19 reached a peak . 
Signed documents will once again be needed for people to leave home and moving between regions will no longer be possible . 
People can only leave the house to buy essential goods , seek medical attention , or use their daily one hour allocation of exercise . 
But unlike the previous lockdown , most schools are to remain open , Macron said , while universities will revert to online teaching and working from home will be generalised . 
Visits to care homes will still be allowed , as will funerals , Macron said . 
France has just reported 244 new deaths from coronavirus over the previous 24 hours and 36,437 new confirmed coronavirus cases , taking the total to 1,235,132 .
