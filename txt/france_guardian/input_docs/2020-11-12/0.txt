The French prime minister , Jean Castex , said there would be no easing of a second Covid 19 lockdown in France for at least two weeks , with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave . 
Castex said that one in four deaths in the country were due to the virus and that while the R number was now below 1 , it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures . 
He told a news conference : It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now . 
The gains ( we are seeing ) are fragile . 
The prime minister said that if the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained , France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week . 
But he said he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread of infections quickened once more . 
The virus has killed more than 42,000 people in France . 
Health authorities reported 35,879 new cases on Wednesday , taking the total to 1.86 million , overtaking Russia and making France the worst affected country in the European region . 
" The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously , " the French prime minister said . 
Authorities could ease restrictions for Christmas holidays if conditions allow , Castex said .
