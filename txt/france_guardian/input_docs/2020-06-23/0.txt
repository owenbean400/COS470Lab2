The Maldives will reopen its tourist resorts from mid July after a months long virus enforced shutdown , the country â€™s president said , adding that international travellers would be welcomed to the Indian ocean holiday hotspot . 
Tourism is a major earner for the Maldives , a tropical island nation popular with honeymooners and celebrities . 
" The country will reopen its borders for international travel , and the government will allow resorts to welcome visitors from July 15 , " president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih told reporters . 
Foreign visitors would not be required to undergo virus tests or carry virus free certificates to enter the archipelago of 1,190 tiny coral islets , the government said . 
Visitors showing virus symptoms or with high fevers would be tested for the infectious disease at the airport , officials said . 
The lockdown would be eased further with schools and restaurants , as well as mosques , to be re opened in the country of Sunni Muslims in the near future , Solih added , without mentioning any dates . 
Tourists were stranded in the Maldives when international flights were halted from late March to combat the spread of the virus . 
Most of them left by mid April on government organised or privately chartered flights . 
International flights have not yet resumed , although charters and special flights are permitted to arrive and leave the main airport in Male . 
The South Asian nation , which has a population of 340,000 people , has so far reported 2,217 virus infections including eight deaths . 
The Maldives attracted a record 1.7 million foreign tourists last year , a 15 % increase from 2018 , according to the government . 
Visitor numbers are expected to halve this year .
