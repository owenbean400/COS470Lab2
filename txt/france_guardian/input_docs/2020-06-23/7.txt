The Guardian has just published its editorial on the easing of England ’s lockdown measures : The consequence is that the country ’s exit from lockdown in July will be a bigger gamble than it may have been at a later stage . 
In weighing the risks to public health of easing lockdown against the economic risks of not doing so , Mr Johnson has opted to prioritise the economy and hope his bet pays off .

As a scramble takes place to bring the test and trace insurance strategy up to speed , the country can only hope his faith in the public is borne out .
