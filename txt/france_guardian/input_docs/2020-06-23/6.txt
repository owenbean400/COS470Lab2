Venezuela ’s western Zulia state has emerged as a hot spot as poorly supplied hospitals and chronic shortages of water and power make it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading , Reuters has reported . 
The government of President Nicolás Maduro has identified Zulia as an epicentre , with official statistics showing 590 cases and 10 deaths in the sweltering border state that shares a frontier with neighbouring Colombia . 
But opposition leaders have questioned the official figures , noting a lack of transparency in the reporting of cases and persecution of reporters , doctors and nurses who have contradicted the authorities . 
Juan Pablo Guanipa , an opposition legislator who represents the state of Zulia said : There are more deaths from coronavirus than the regime is announcing . 
The figures they are presenting are not credible . 
Venezuela ’s information ministry and the Zulia government did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters .
