The UK government has given the green light to a night out in a pub or restaurant in England but gym workouts , swimming pools , nightclub dance floors and even manicures are still off limits – prompting accusations of glaring inconsistencies as the lockdown is eased , Zoe Wood and Paul Mac Innes write . 
The chief executive of Pure Gym , the UK ’s biggest gym chain , said he was " bitterly disappointed " by the delay in opening its 269 gyms and questioned the government ’s commitment to tackling obesity . 
" It is a strange war on obesity that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms , " said Humphrey Cobbold who highlighted that the company had already safely reopened its gyms in Switzerland and Denmark . 
Jane Nickerson , the chief executive of Swim England , called on the government to urgently rethink its decision : " Prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it ’s safer to go into a pub than a pool and I ’ll shut up . 
But if not , examine the evidence , come and see our test sites and let us open . "
