The Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenkovic is refusing to self isolate following his brief encounter with Novak Djokovic , the men ’s world number one tennis player who has tested positive . 
The Croatian Public Health Institute said Plenkovic did not have to self isolate as the risk of infection was low because he only briefly met Djokovic and was not in a close contact with him . 
Three other players who played in Djokovic ’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region have also tested positive . 
Plenkovic attended the tournament in the northern Adriatic town of Zadar on Saturday , a day before it was cancelled after Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria said he tested positive . 
Croatia ’s Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also tested positive as well as Djokovic ’s fitness coach Marco Panichi and Dimitrov ’s coach Christian Groh . 
On Monday , Plenkovic tested negative but calls from opposition politicians for him to self isolate have grown stronger .
