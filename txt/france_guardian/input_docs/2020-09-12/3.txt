Cuban state media reported on Saturday that interprovincial transportation would be shut down and a curfew in Havana extended until the end of the month , as a surge in coronavirus cases in the capital spreads to other areas . 
While most of the country remains at a new normal with schools and retail activity open , local authorities have been tightening enforcement of wearing masks , social distancing and other measures , and imposing quarantines wherever cases appear , Reuters reports . 
Cuba had mostly contained its coronavirus outbreak by the end of June by isolating patients and contacts , and eased lockdown restrictions . 
But it tightened them again in Havana by August and has yet to contain a surge in cases there with about 200 reported over the last week . 
There have been smaller outbreaks in a handful of Cuba ’s 14 provinces . 
Central Ciego de Avila province has suffered the worst outbreak to date after Havana with cases reaching 28 of 60 reported in the country Saturday . 
All but a few of the remainder were in Havana . 
One hundred patients were moved to a hospital in neighbouring Camaguey province from Ciego de Avila on Thursday because of a shortage of hospital space . 
In August , a brigade of nurses marched off from eastern Granma province to the capital as if they were some of the 4,000 medical staff sent abroad to battle the pandemic . 
While just under 4,700 cases have been reported since the first one in March and only 108 deaths , the US embargoed Caribbean nation has been all but bankrupted by the pandemic ’s toll on tourism , remittances , investment and trade . 
Economic growth is now forecast to drop by close to 10 % this year according to various international organisations and there are long lines for basic goods and shortages of certain foods and medicines .
