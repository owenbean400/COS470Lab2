El Salvador ’s government said on Saturday it plans to reopen airports for international flights starting on 19 September , but with a twist : incoming passengers will be required to show a negative PCR coronavirus test no more than three days old . 
Anyone lacking the test would be denied entry , according to the Associated Press . 
The new measures were contained in a notice to airlines published by the country ’s port authorities . 
It was unclear whether the requirement would apply to Salvadoran citizens , who have a constitutional right to re enter their country . 
The Central American country has enacted some of the regions strictest pandemic measures , such as closing borders , imposing a national quarantine and dispatching police and the army to detain violators . 
Some of those measures have been challenged in court . 
Roberto d ’Aubuisson , the mayor of the city of Santa Tecla , who had been trapped outside the country for months after the border and airport closures in March , called on the government to clarify if the new measures apply to Salvadorans . 
El Salvador has seen 26,851 confirmed coronavirus cases and 782 deaths .
