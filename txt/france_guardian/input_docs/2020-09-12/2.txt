Pfizer Inc and Bio NTech SE have proposed to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to expand the enrollment of their phase 3 pivotal Covid 19 vaccine trial to up to about 44,000 participants , the companies said on Saturday . 
The initial target figure for the trial was up to 30,000 participants , which the companies said they expect to reach by next week , Reuters reports . 
According to the Pfizer website , the company uses more than 120 clinical trial sites in their efforts to develop a vaccine , and as of last Monday , 25,189 trial participants had already enrolled . 
The proposed expansion would allow the companies to enrol people as young as 16 and people with chronic , stable HIV , hepatitis C and hepatitis B . Drugmakers racing to develop a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine pledged in July to ensure their larger clinical trials would include diverse sets of volunteers . 
" Diversity in clinical trials is a priority for Pfizer and is critical given that Covid 19 disproportionately impacts communities of color in the US , " Pfizer â€™s chief business officer John Young said in a US congressional hearing in July . 
If the study is successful , the companies could submit the vaccine for regulatory approval as early as October , putting them on track to supply up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion by the end of 2021 .
