Several thousand people protested in German cities on Saturday against measures imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus , while hundreds marched in the Polish capital Warsaw . 
About 8,000 people marched in the southern German city of Munich , according to a police estimate , most of them ignoring a city ordinance requiring the wearing of masks . 
At least a thousand turned out in Hanover , central Germany and there was another demonstration in the western city of Wiesbaden . 
Tens of thousands turned out for similar demonstrations last month in Berlin . 
The movement is made up of a number of different groups , from self declared " free thinkers " to anti vaccine campaigners , conspiracy theorists and far right activists . 
Although clashes marred the last protest in Berlin late in August there have been no reports of trouble so far on Saturday . 
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , said in a statement on Saturday she understood why some people had a problem with the restrictions being imposed . 
She acknowledged that people were free to criticise government policy in peaceful protests . 
And in what appeared to be a response to some protesters ’ claims of being censured , she pointed out that many people envied Germany for the freedom accorded people to publicly disagree and demonstrate . 
In the Polish capital , Warsaw , meanwhile , several hundred people joined a similar protest that marched through the city centre . 
Some protesters carried placards denouncing what they say are the " lies " told about the pandemic . 
Others placards denounced the Microsoft billionaire turned philanthropist Bill Gates – the target of conspiracy theories about the virus – or called for the resignation of the government , AFP reports .
