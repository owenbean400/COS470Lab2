The French prime minister , Jean Castex , has tested negative for coronavirus again and will come out of self isolation on Saturday , a week after being in contact with someone who had a positive result , his office said , according to Reuters . 
Castex had already tested negative for Covid 19 since sharing a car last weekend with the director of the Tour de France cycle race , who later tested positive . 
France is grappling with a resurgence in coronavirus cases , and on Friday the prime minister outlined plans to speed up testing and toughen measures in certain cities as the government seeks to avoid a repeat of the spring â€™s nationwide lockdown .
