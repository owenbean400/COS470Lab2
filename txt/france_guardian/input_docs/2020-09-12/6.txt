The Venice Film Festival is wrapping up the first in person Covid era international cinema showcase , with critics , filmmakers and actors cheering organisers for having dared to hold the festival amid a pandemic and for demonstrating how to go to the movies again safely . 
The festival ’s coveted Golden Lion awards were being handed out Saturday night before a masked audience conspicuously lacking in Hollywood star power , given that coronavirus travel restrictions kept all but a few American productions away , the Associated Press reports . 
Eighteen films were vying for the top awards in the main competition , including a record eight directed by women . 
That the 10 day festival took place at all was something of a miracle , given that northern Italy in late February became ground zero for Europe ’s coronavivrus outbreak . 
The Cannes Film Festival was cancelled and other big international festivals in Toronto and New York opted to go mostly online . 
But after Italy managed to tame its infections with a strict 10 week lockdown , Venice decided to go ahead , albeit under safety protocols that would have previously been unthinkable for a festival that has prided itself on spectacular visuals and glamorous clientele . 
Face masks were required indoors and out . 
The public was barred from the red carpet and paparazzi , who would normally chase after stars in rented boats as they arrived on the Lido aboard water taxis , were given socially distanced positions on land . 
While its too soon to say if the measures worked , there were no immediate reports of infections among festival goers and compliance with mask mandates and social distancing appeared to be high .
