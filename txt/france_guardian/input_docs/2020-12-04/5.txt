In Australia , the state of Victoria , which successfully managed to suppress a second wave of the virus , has recorded its 36th day in a row of no new cases of the virus . 
There are also no active cases . 
The state peaked at more than 700 new cases in one day in August , and more than 800 Covid deaths have been recorded in the state since the pandemic began . 
The state will also reopen to international arrivals from Monday , though they will first have to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine . 
The state government says it has significantly overhauled and improved the programme , since it was behind the state ’s second wave . 
Meanwhile in New South Wales , the health department will examine the self isolation process of international airline crews after it was revealed they were the probable source of a local coronavirus infection . 
After the state recorded more than 20 consecutive days of no community cases , last week a new case was identified . 
On Thursday health authorities revealed that a woman had become sick after working at a quarantine hotel in Darling Harbour . 
Genomic testing on the new case showed it was a strain from the United States , likely acquired from airline crew staying at the Novotel . 
It prompted the NSW health minister , Brad Hazzard , to say that the allowance for airline staff to self isolate may be a weakness in the system . 
Testing of the woman ’s close contacts and other staff at the hotel is continuing .
