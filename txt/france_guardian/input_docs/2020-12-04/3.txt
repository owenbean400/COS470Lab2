High blood sugar increases the risk of dying for Covid 19 patients even if they do not have diabetes , according to a study . 
Out of 11,000 coronavirus patients in Spain , none were critically ill when they got to the hospital . 
But researchers found those who arrived with above normal blood sugar levels had higher odds of dying there regardless of whether they were diabetic . 
Overall , 20 % of the patients died while hospitalised , including 16 % of individuals with blood sugar below 140 milligrams per deciliter at admission , 34 % of those with levels of 140 to 180 mg/d L , and 41 % of patients with levels above 180 mg/d L . After taking age and medical conditions into account , patients with the highest levels were 50 % more likely to die in the hospital than patients with the lowest levels . 
People with elevated blood sugar were also at higher risk for needing intensive care and mechanical breathing assistance . 
In a report published in Annals of Medicine , the researchers say prompt control of blood sugar should be mandatory in the management of patients hospitalised with Covid 19 , regardless of whether they have diabetes .
