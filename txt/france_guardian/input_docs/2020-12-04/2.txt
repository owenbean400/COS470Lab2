The World Health Organization hopes to have half a billion doses of Covid 19 vaccines available for distribution by the global COVAX initiative in the first quarter of 2021 , its chief scientist said . 
To date 189 countries have joined the COVAX programme , which is backed by the WHO and seeks to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines . 
The United States is not among them , having secured bilateral deals . 
The initial COVAX plan is to vaccinate the 20 % of populations at highest risk , including health workers and people aged over 65 . 
The goal is to get at least 2 billion doses by end of 2021 which will be enough to vaccinate 20 % of the populations of countries that are part of COVAX , " chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a Geneva news conference . 
This would be enough to " bring to an end the acute phase of the pandemic " by reducing mortality and the impact on health systems , she said . 
" Our goal , our hope is that in the first quarter of 2021 that we would have about half a billion of doses available to be distributed across the countries , in a fair manner , " Swaminathan said . 
So countries can start expecting doses toward the end of the first quarter of 2021 . 
A few countries may start earlier , it â€™s likely , possible , that we may have some learnings by going early into a few countries , " she said . 
" But then the majority , the bulk of the tranches would probably start moving out in the second quarter of 2021 . "
