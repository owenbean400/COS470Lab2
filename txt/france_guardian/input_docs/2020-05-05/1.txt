The French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi SA plans to enrol thousands of subjects globally for trials of an experimental vaccine it is developing with Glaxo Smith Kline Plc , a senior executive has told Reuters . 
Sanofi , whose Pasteur division has an established track record in influenza vaccines , is working with the British firm GSK to come up with a candidate for trial it hopes will be ready next year . 
Sanofi Pasteur executives told Reuters the company hopes to start early stage trials in September , with hundreds of subjects enrolled . 
While phase one vaccine trials typically involves a small number of healthy volunteers to test for safety , Sanofi said it had opted for higher numbers to secure stronger data sooner . 
" We envisioned phase one to actually have several hundreds of subjects , so it is really a phase one/two trial , " said John Shiver , head of Sanofi vaccine research .
