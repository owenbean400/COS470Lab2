The country ’s prime minister , Jean Castex said on Friday that the government would strengthen controls at France ’s borders in the hope of better containing the pandemic , with people arriving from some countries being subject to compulsory testing . 
Nearly 8,000 cases have been diagnosed in Catalonia over the past 14 days – accounting for almost half of the 16,410 detected across Spain . 
Catalonia ’s public health secretary , Josep Maria Argimon , said the situation in and around Barcelona was " at a critical moment " and called on people to heed the regional government ’s request not to leave their homes unless strictly necessary . 
Meanwhile , Norway has said it will reimpose a 10 day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday after a surge in coronavirus cases there . 
However , the government also said it would ease restrictions on people coming from more counties of Sweden , according to Reuters . 
Residents of the European Union , European Economic Area or Schengen countries with fewer than 20 confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last two weeks are able to enter Norway without being required to go into self quarantine .
