The 25th edition of France ’s Colmar Jazz Festival , scheduled for September , has been postponed until next year due to the coronavirus epidemic , the city said in a statement on Wednesday . 
" Current progress in the health crisis does not allow us today , realistically , to consider staging concerts in September , " the statement says , adding that this edition of the festival will now take place in 2021 . 
Guitarists Sylvain Luc and Bireli Lagrene , American singer China Moses , daughter of Dee Dee Bridgewater , and French pianist Sebastian Troendle were to perform at this year ’s festival in the city near the Rhine river border with Germany . 
Attracting more than 5,000 people last year , the show had been due to run from 10 to 28 September . 
Nevertheless , a concert by gypsy jazz guitarist Angelo Debarre will go ahead on 24 September at the nearby town of Selestat . 
The Colmar Film Festival , slated for October , has also been cancelled for the same reason with city officials judging it to be " impossible to welcome film and television personalities in the friendly and festive conditions that make the festival famous . " 
France has recorded over 225,000 cases of Covid 19 and over 30,000 deaths since the disease emerged at the end of 2019 . 
A recent upsurge has seen new preventive measures reintroduced .
