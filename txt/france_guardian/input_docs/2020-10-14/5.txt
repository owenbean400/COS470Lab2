Ireland â€™s government moved three counties on its open border with Northern Ireland - Donegal , Monaghan and Cavan - to Level 4 of its five step framework of Covid 19 constraints and banned almost all visits to homes across the country . 
Northern Ireland announced the strictest curbs seen in the UK since early summer on Wednesday in response to a rapid rise in cases that the Irish prime minister Micheal Martin described as " hugely worrying . " 
The new Irish measures mean all non essential retail will be banned until 10 November in the first counties to be moved to Level 4 . 
Martin said he wanted to continue to assess the impact of the recently imposed Level 3 curbs elsewhere for the next week .
