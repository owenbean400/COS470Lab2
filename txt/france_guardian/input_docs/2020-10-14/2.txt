UK government ministers want to place universities in England into lockdown for two weeks before Christmas , with students told to remain on campus and all teaching carried out online , the Guardian has learned . 
Under the plan , which is in its early stages , universities would go into lockdown from 8 December until 22 December , when all students would be allowed to return to their home towns . 
The move is designed to deliver on Boris Johnson â€™s pledge to " get students home safely for Christmas " but prevent the spread of the virus by limiting mixing between the student body and wider community in the weeks before more than a million students travel home . 
Infection rates in some university cities are significantly higher among students than in the general population . 
Under the plan , students with Covid 19 or its symptoms , and those who have been in contact with them , would have to remain in their accommodation for as long as their quarantine period demands . 
Michelle Donelan , the universities minister for England , is to hold talks with representatives of Universities UK and other higher education leaders on Thursday in an effort to persuade them to back the plan .
