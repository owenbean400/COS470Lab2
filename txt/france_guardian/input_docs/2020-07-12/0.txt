A French expert warned on Sunday that there was little chance of a 100 percent effective coronavirus vaccine by 2021 , and urged people to take social distancing measures more seriously . 
" A vaccine is several years in development , " said epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet , a member of the team of scientists advising the French government on the crisis , speaking on BFMTV television . 
" Of course , there is an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine , but I would be very surprised if we had that was effective in 2021 , " he added . 
While we would probably have one that worked partially , we were very far from the end of the crisis , he said . 
That being the case , " we have to live with this virus " he said . 
" This summer , let ’s respect physical distance , at least , " he said , stressing that large gatherings were the main threat . 
On Saturday , a DJ ’s set on a beach in the Mediterranean resort of Nice in southern France drew thousands of people together , sparking a furious reaction on social media , AFP reports . 
Fontanet said the main risks for the appearance of new virus clusters were in confined spaces , such as on cruise ships , warships , sports halls , discos , slaughterhouses , accommodation housing migrant workers and places of worship . 
On Wednesday , the French government said it was preparing for a second wave of Covid 19 , but rather than imposing another nationwide lockdown , they would use " targeted " measures such as stay at home orders or business closures .
