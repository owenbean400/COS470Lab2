Chilean copper miners ’ unions have demanded a re evaluation of the operational continuity plans of the country ’s biggest mines during what they said was an " alarming " increase in coronavirus cases among workers , Reuters reports . 
In a statement signed by the union leadership of state owned Codelco , the Mines Federation - which groups the majority of workers for Chile ’s major copper mines - rejected the " business as usual " discourse advanced by miners and the mines minister , Baldo Prokurica . 
" The increase in cases is alarming and demonstrates that the preventive measures implemented with health and safety protocols aimed at self care are not working and makes it evident that contrary to what the union believed , security and isolation measures have not immunized workers from contagion , " the statement added . 
The statement comes just days after unionised workers at Codelco , the world ’s largest copper miner , said they were weighing walking off the job at some sites in order to implement a self imposed quarantine after one of their members died from Covid 19 . 
Chile has more than 170,000 cases and 3,300 deaths from Covid 19 , one of the highest rates of infection in the world per 100,000 inhabitants .
