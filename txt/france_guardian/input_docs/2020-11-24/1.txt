France will start easing its Covid 19 lockdown this weekend so that by Christmas , shops , theatres and cinemas will re open and people will be able to spend the holiday with the rest of their family , French president Emmanuel Macron has said . 
In a televised address to the nation , Macron said the worst of the second wave of the epidemic in France was over , but that restaurants , cafes and bars would have to stay shut until 20 January to avoid triggering a third wave . 
" We must do everything to avoid a third wave , do everything to avoid a third lockdown , " Macron said . 
After curfew measures in major French cities in mid October failed to produce the results the government had hoped for , it enforced a one month lockdown on 30 October , though it was less strict than a lockdown that ran from 17 March to 11 May . Positive trends including a decline in hospitalisations for Covid 19 infections , combined with pressure from business lobbies who say they are facing ruin , have led to calls to start loosening the lockdown as soon as possible . 
Macron also said he would start a vaccination campaign at the end of December or beginning of January , starting with the most vulnerable and older people . 
Vaccination wo not be mandatory , he said .
