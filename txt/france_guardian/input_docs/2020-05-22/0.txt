France regrets a British decision to impose a quarantine on people arriving from mainland Europe and stands ready to impose reciprocal measures , the Agence France Presse news agency has quoted the country ’s interior ministry as saying . 
The UK ’s home secretary Priti Patel announced earlier on Friday that travellers arriving in the UK from 8 June will have to tell the authorities where they will be staying and face spot checks to ensure they quarantine themselves for 14 days . 
People arriving from Ireland will be exempt , but not those coming from mainland Europe .
