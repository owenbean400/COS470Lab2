Travellers arriving in Britain will face 14 days ’ quarantine from next month to prevent a second coronavirus outbreak , the government announced on Friday , warning that anyone breaking the rules faced a fine or prosecution . 
The new rules will apply to all international arrivals except Ireland from 8 June and come after weeks of calls for tougher restrictions to curb the spread of Covid 19 . 
Healthcare professionals travelling to work in the crisis , seasonal agricultural workers and those working in freight and road haulage , among others , will be exempt . 
" We want to reduce the risk of imported cases being introduced into the UK , " the home secretary , Priti Patel , told the government ’s daily media briefing . 
Patel said the measure would be reviewed every three weeks , adding : " We are not shutting down completely . 
We are not closing our borders . 
What we are seeking to do is control the spread of the virus because we do not want a second wave of this virus . " 
The quarantine move is controversial , especially with the aviation sector , where flights have been grounded and passenger numbers slumped . 
France also expressed disappointment that despite initial reassurances it would not be exempt from the plan .
