The inaugural flight of the Ariane 6 rocket will be set back until next year because the coronavirus pandemic has led to project delays at development sites , the European Space Agency said . 
" We can say for certain that the launch will not happen in 2020 , " Daniel Neuenschwander , ESA â€™s director of space transportation , told AFP . 
The ESA , which groups 13 European countries , has not indicated when in 2021 a launch from the Spaceport in Kourou , French Guiana , may now be possible .
