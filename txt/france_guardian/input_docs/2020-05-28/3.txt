A man from Georgia was charged in a fedreral court with trying to swindle a foreign government out of $ 317 million ( £ 257 million ) by promising to sell it face masks to protect against the coronavirus with a huge shipment that never existed . 
Paul Penn faces up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted of criminal attempt and conspiracy , according to documents filed by prosecutors in U.S . District Court in Savannah . 
Prosecutors said Penn and at least two partners negotiated a deal between March and April to sell 50 million N95 respirator masks to a foreign government . 
Prosecutors did not identity the government involved . 
The sellers never had the masks , prosecutors said in a court filing , yet they persuaded the foreign government to wire $ 317 million to a bank account . 
Prosecutors said the sales price was five times the market value for the masks . 
The U.S . Secret Service stopped the transaction before it could be completed , according to a news release from the office of U.S . Attorney Bobby Christine of the Southern District of Georgia . 
Using a worldwide pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of those searching for badly needed personal protective equipment is reprehensible , " Christine said in a statement . 
He pledged that federal authorities " will aggressively seek out any fraudsters who exploit this crisis as a way to make a quick buck . 
Court records did not list an attorney for Penn . 
Prosecutors did not identify the two people they said were Penn ’s partners in the scheme . 
Prosecutors said Penn helped negotiate the sale through his company , Spectrum Global Holdings LLC . 
Georgia incorporation records show Penn formed the company in 2018 in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross .
