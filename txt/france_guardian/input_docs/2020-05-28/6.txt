One in 10 diabetics with coronavirus dies within seven days of hospital admission , according to a study of more than 1,300 patients . 
Two thirds of the patients were men , and the average age across both sexes was 70 , the study published in the journal Diabetologia found . 
" The presence of diabetic complications and increased age increase the risk of death , " the researchers said . 
" Increased BMI " - body mass index , a ratio of height to weight - " is associated with both increased risk of needing mechanical ventilation and with increased risk of death , " they said . 
Worse blood sugar control in and of itself , however , did not seem to impact a patient â€™s outcome . 
So called microvascular complications - affecting the eyes , kidney and nerves - were found in nearly half of the patients , who were admitted to 53 French hospitals from March 10 to March 31 . 
Problems related to larger arteries in the heart , brain and legs were reported in more than 40 percent of the patients . 
The presence of either type of complication doubled the risk of death by the seventh day of hospitalisation . 
Patients over 75 years old were 14 times more likely to die than those 55 or younger . 
By the seventh day of hospitalisation , a fifth of patients had been intubated on ventilators , and a tenth had died . 
Nearly a quarter of patients had been discharged home by this point . 
The study confirmed that insulin and other treatments modifying blood sugar were not a risk factor for severe forms of COVID 19 , and should be continued for persons with diabetes . 
Other significant risk factors included heart disease , high blood pressure , and a history of lung disease .
