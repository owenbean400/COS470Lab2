Stefany Carvallido , her two year old daughter and about 200 other Colombians have been camping out inside Brazil ’s busiest international airport for days in a desperate attempt to get back to their home country . 
More than two months after the coronavirus pandemic triggered worldwide lockdowns , much of the world is gradually reopening . 
But Latin America remains highly isolated by travel restrictions across the region . 
Colombia has suspended all international flights until at least Aug . 31 , preventing its own citizens from returning by air . 
It has also suspended river and land border crossings with neighbors including Brazil . 
Carvallido said she and her daughter Maria Jose had spent nearly two weeks at Guarulhos International Airport , located on the outskirts of Sao Paulo , the city with the lion ’s share of Brazil ’s coronavirus cases so far . 
The same airport saw a surge in traffic last week , when travelers descended on it hoping to beat a new U.S . ban on foreigners coming from Brazil . 
" In this situation , we want to be with our families and my daughter wants it too ... 
It is very , very difficult , " said Carvallido . 
Carvallido , 24 , and others are eating from lunch boxes and donations and also take turns at an improvised kitchen set up outside the airport . 
They wash in the airport bathrooms using a small hose . 
They are demanding humanitarian flights . 
But Colombia ’s foreign ministry said on Thursday no new flights from Brazil were scheduled until next week . 
Since late April there have been three such flights , taking a total of 346 people back to Colombia . 
Though called humanitarian , Colombians must pay $ 350 for the flights , and that is money Carvallido and many others at the airport do not have . 
Their calls for a free flight home have led nowhere so far . 
" Under current regulations , this request is not possible , " the Colombian consulate in Sao Paulo said .
