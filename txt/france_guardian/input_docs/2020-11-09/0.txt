A Covid 19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable , which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic , a senior World Health Organization ( WHO ) official has said . 
Bruce Aylward told the WHO ’s annual ministerial assembly that interim results from Pfizer ’s late stage vaccine trial were " very positive " . 
" There is still much work to be done , this is just interim results ... but some very positive results coming today which should hold great promise hopefully for the entire world as we move forward , " Aylward told the 194 member state forum . 
" By March as a result of the extraordinary work happening globally we could be in a position to fundamentally change the direction and the dynamic of this crisis , " he added .
