North Korean leader Kim Jong Un convened an emergency politburo meeting after a person suspected of having Covid 19 returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border this month , state media said on Sunday . 
Kim declared a state of emergency and imposed a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong , calling it a " critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country , " state news agency KCNA reported . 
If confirmed , it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities , who have so far said the country has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus . 
According to KCNA , a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid 19 . 
" An emergency event happened in Kaesong City where a runaway who went to the south three years ago , a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line , " KCNA said . 
KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested , but said an " uncertain result was made from several medical check ups of the secretion of that person â€™s upper respiratory organ and blood , " prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with . 
North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries , and imposed strict border closures . 
Thousands of people in North Korea were quarantined , but restrictions had recently eased .
