Hollywood studios are planning on recruiting COVID 19 consultants to keep sets safe , according to a report by Reuters . 
The coronavirus pandemic has prompted producers , movie studios and workers ’ unions to seek expert advice on how to safely reopen film and TV sets , which shut down worldwide in mid March . 
In demand are epidemiologists and other public health specialists to provide detailed strategies for dealing with large crews who work in cramped spaces , makeup artists who get face to face with stars , and actors who kiss , hug and fight on set . 
The shutdown has taken a severe financial toll across the industry , as well as on cities such as Los Angeles that benefit economically from production . 
Restarting is important to companies , including Netflix Inc , Walt Disney Co and others , which need fresh programming to engage audiences . 
While sets remain empty in the United States , productions are ramping back up in South Korea , Australia , Sweden , as well as New Zealand , where James Cameron ’s Avatar 2 is restarting this week . 
People who work in the industry expect to see smaller crews , regular testing , hand sanitiser everywhere and the use of computer generated imagery to create big crowds on screen when work resumes .
