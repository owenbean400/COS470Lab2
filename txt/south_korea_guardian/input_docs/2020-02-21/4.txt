Agence France Presse has conducted interviews with some of the crew members of the Diamond Princess , who were not subject to the same quarantine restrictions on the ship . 
They ( the crew ) were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins , leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship , which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID 19 disease . 
As they have been in close contact with possibly infected passengers , the crew is expected to undergo a 14 day quarantine starting when the last passenger leaves the ship . 
Crew have generally been reticent to speak to media , apparently concerned for their jobs , but some have broken their silence to describe difficult conditions and fear on board . 
Sonali Thakkar , a 24 year old security officer on board , told AFP in an interview crews were sleeping two to a cabin , sharing washrooms and eating together , " so the disease can spread very easily . " 
" We do have a lot of fear , me and my colleagues , more than 1000 crew . 
We â€™ve been working since the quarantine started . 
As the days pass and the number of patients increase , the crew is feeling more afraid , " she said . 
" They are scared that it can spread really fast and all we want is tests to be done and to be separated from those who are positive . 
We do not want to stay on board . " 
Her father Dinesh said : " Sonali is stuck in a small windowless room on the cruise and is very scared ... 
We speak to her every day trying to calm her . " 
" Why did the government wait for so long as more and more people got infected ? 
She should have been rescued with other Indians from the cruise long ago . 
This is very wrong , " he told AFP .
