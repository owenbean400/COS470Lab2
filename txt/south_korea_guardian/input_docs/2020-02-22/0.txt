Yoon sook Lee , a restaurant owner in Yulha dong , Daegu , the city at the heart of South Korea ’s coronavirus outbreak , said : It is literally like how I imagine Gotham City to be . 
Streets are deserted and those who are outside are half running as if they are all in a hurry or being chased . 
I run a restaurant which serves takeaway lunches for special events . 
As all events are being cancelled , all my orders have been cancelled . 
From the evening of the 19th , I ’ve noticed that people are stockpiling water and instant noodles . 
It ’s also difficult to buy masks . 
I had to queue up for two hours at Costco to get a single box of 20 masks . 
We try and stay indoors as much as possible and when we do have to venture outside , we make sure to wear a mask . 
We try and wash our hands as often as possible even when we ’re at home . 
I ’m starting to feel panicky as I ’m worried about my family . 
I have young children so I ’m worried about them . 
I ’m also getting really worried about how long this will go on as it will affect our family ’s income from the restaurant . 
I ’m getting news from TV and social media but I think there is also a lot of fake news . 
Last month in Daegu , some You Tubers pretended to be chasing down an infected person on the subway and it was found to be fake . 
Everyone thought how ridiculous they were but now things do not seem so far off from what they were filming .
