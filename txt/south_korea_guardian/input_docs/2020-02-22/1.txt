Andrew Tatem , a professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton , said the new cases outside China were worrying : Prior to the recent news of apparent outbreaks in South Korea , Italy and Iran , it seemed like the relatively low number of cases outside of China and with no link to travelling there pointed to hope that the virus could be contained . 
This recent news , particularly regarding Iran , is especially worrying , and [ WHO director general ] Dr [ Tedros Adhanom ] Ghebreyesus ’ assessment that the window of opportunity for containing the outbreak is narrowing is certainly correct . 
The fact that cases have been confirmed in both Canada and Lebanon that seem to have come from Iran suggests that a significant outbreak is ongoing there and may have been occurring for some time . 
Given the relative rarity of international travel across a whole national population typically , especially a country like Iran where international travel may be rarer per capita than for high income countries like in North America and Europe , exported cases seen internationally can often represent the tip of an iceberg of something occurring in the origin country . 
Iran normally has some strong travel connections to countries where health systems may be weaker , such as Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan – importations and outbreaks here would be particularly concerning in terms of capacities to detect the virus and contain spread .
