China aims to inoculate 50 million people with homegrown Covid 19 vaccines ahead of February ’s Lunar New Year celebrations . 
Tao Lina , a vaccination expert formerly with the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention , confirmed the target to CNN on Monday after reviewing a transcript of a government conference call on December 15 , where the mass vaccination rollout plan was discussed . 
Tao added that implementation will depend on conditions on the ground . 
Chinese authorities have said their first step will be to vaccinate essential workers such as medical and disease control professionals , customs and border inspection workers , and people in the food industry , according to health officials who attended a press conference Saturday on the country ’s vaccination plan . 
Since July , China has administered more than a million doses of domestically produced vaccines to people considered " high risk " groups under an emergency use program . 
Officials say they have found no serious adverse reactions so far . 
Currently , five vaccines developed by Chinese companies are going through the final phase of clinical trials in more than a dozen countries around the world .
