Connecticut Gov . 
Ned Lamont spoke candidly about his state 's shutdown and struggle to obtain supplies during the early days of the pandemic while taking part in a panel today at the Yale School of Public Health . 
" At that point , you had 50 governors scrambling , " Lamont said , describing planes landing with ordered personal protective equipment , then taking off to another place with a higher offer . 
The governor also described the days leading up to initial shutdowns in the United States , and the realization that Connecticut would not receive supplies promised by the federal government . 
Lamont remarked on a speech by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the National Governors ' Association meeting in early 2020 , where Pompeo warned against making deals with China . 
Lamont described the speech as foreshadowing his realization that the federal government was not in control of supply chains for personal protective equipment . 
" There was no supply down in Washington , DC . 
You probably heard , ' Do not worry , the cavalry 's on the way , ' " Lamont said . 
" There was nothing there . " 
Lamont added he had to convince his constituents that the virus was a matter of life or death . 
" I could not just order people , ' Wear the mask , stay safe , stay home , or else I 'm going to arrest you , â€™ " said Lamont .
