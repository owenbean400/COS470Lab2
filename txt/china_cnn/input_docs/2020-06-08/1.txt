China 's Foreign Ministry has called on US Senator Rick Scott to " produce the evidence " after he accused China of trying to " sabotage " US vaccine efforts . 
" The Senator claims there is evidence showing China is sabotaging and slowing down Western countries ' [ vaccine ] efforts , I hope he will just produce the evidence , " said Hua Chunying , a spokesperson for China â€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday . 
Hua said research and development for a coronavirus vaccine is not " a race between China and the US but between humans and the virus . " 
She added that if China successfully develops a vaccine it will be made a " global public good . " 
Hua 's comments come after Scott told the BBC during an interview : " We have got to get this vaccine done . 
Unfortunately , we have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down . "
