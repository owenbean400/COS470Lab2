Formula One has placed 50 % of its staff into temporary furlough whilst the sport ’s Chief Executive , Chase Carey , will take a significant voluntary salary cut as part of measures to reduce costs during the coronavirus crisis . 
In addition , Formula One directors and executives have voluntarily agreed to take a 20 % pay cut . 
The furloughing of staff will be in place to the end of May . Staff will use the UK Government ’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme , which pays those placed on temporary leave 80 % of their wages , to a maximum of £ 2,500 a month , in a bid to help companies retain their workforce and prevent redundancies during the crisis . 
F1 teams furloughing : Three F1 teams – Mc Laren , Williams and Racing Point – have already furloughed sections of their workforce , with the teams ’ drivers also taking a pay cut . 
Races cancelled and postponed : The current F1 season is yet to start , with two races cancelled – Australia and Monaco – and six more postponed – Bahrain , Vietnam , China , Netherlands , Spain and Azerbaijan – so far . 
The season is now scheduled to begin with the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal on Sunday 14 June , however , organizers have said they will make a decision after the Easter weekend on whether to proceed with the race . 
Formula One has said it hopes to resume racing in the European summer and is working on a reduced and rejigged calendar of 15 – 18 Grands Prix , with the anticipation that the season end date will extend beyond the original end date of Sunday 29 November . 
The sport ’s rules dictate a minimum of eight races must be held for a season to be defined as a World Championship .
