Korean Air has started using grounded passenger planes to transport cargo , the airline said in a news release today . 
The move will help make up for lost revenue and support South Korean companies in importing and exporting goods , according to the company . 
Due to various global travel bans and restrictions , Korean Air has suspended 89 of its 124 passenger routes . 
The airline is only operating 14 % of its international passenger flights . 
Korean Air began using passenger aircraft for cargo on a flight to Ho Chi Mihn , Vietnam , on Friday , and will begin cargo transport to Qingdao , China , on March 21 . 
The aviation industry is suffering . 
Earlier this month , Airports Council International ( ACI ) predicted that airport passenger traffic volume for the first quarter of 2020 will be down at least 12 percentage points compared to what it previously projected , with Asia Pacific passenger traffic down 24 % compared to previous forecasts . 
Before the pandemic , global airport revenues for the first quarter of 2020 were forecast to reach almost $ 39.5 billion . 
ACI now estimates a loss of revenue of at least $ 4.3 billion .
