The Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of Covid 19 from the international community while it stockpiled imports and decreased exports , a Department of Homeland Security report found , according to an administration official familiar with the report . 
The report , which assessed export and import data earlier this year , was circulated within the federal government on Friday , the source said . 
The DHS assessment also says , " in its communications , China intentionally concealed its trade activity by publicly denying it has ever imposed an export ban on masks and other medical supplies , " according to the source . 
The findings were assessed at " moderate confidence , " the source told CNN , pointing out that the report does not conclude whether the actions of the Chinese government were nefarious . 
It is reasonable to conclude that based on the outbreak , before it was declared a pandemic , that China would recognize key measurements in determining requirements for the need of personal protective equipment , said the source . 
The US needs " to be mindful about , ' what do you do about it ? ' " said the source . 
" Is this a trigger that propels industry here ? 
Will there be enough in the stockpile " going forward ? questioned the source . 
China has access to a wide array of raw materials that are necessary in establishing a production line of goods that are necessary in response to the Covid 19 pandemic , said the source , whether it â€™s surgical gowns , masks , or goggles . 
" They have a robust manufacturing capability and workforce that can quickly ramp up manufacturing , " said the source . 
ABC first reported the existence of the report .
