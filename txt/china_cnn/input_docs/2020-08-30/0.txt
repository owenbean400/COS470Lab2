At least 25,009,250 people have been infected with Covid 19 worldwide since the global pandemic began , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally of cases Sunday . 
The figures also show that at least 842,702 people have died after contracting the virus . 
Case numbers have soared exponentially since they first were reported in China in December 2019 . 
The world recorded 1 million cases more than three months later , on April 2 . 
The tally hit 10 million cases on June 28 and took just six weeks to double . 
While the world has learned a great deal about how to control the spread of the virus , governments are starting to lose their grip on the situation once more . 
Countries that were hit early in the pandemic saw case numbers dip after they imposed strict rules around social distancing and movement . 
But the figures are rising fast again as lockdowns are lifted and frustrations among the public lead to a growing backlash against mask wearing and other restrictions that have led to job losses , economic damage and widening inequality . 
As fall approaches in the Northern Hemisphere , doctors are already seeing signs of a dramatic second wave of infection that will be almost impossible to contain until a vaccine is developed and widely distributed -- another step that is already facing fierce opposition .
