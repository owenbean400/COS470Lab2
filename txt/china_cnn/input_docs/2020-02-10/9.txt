Millions of people across China are heading back to work after the Lunar New Year break turned into an extended quarantine due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
Many will be working from their homes , with strict quarantine guidelines in place in many cities and most businesses urging people to work remotely if possible to reduce the chances of transmission . 
The outbreak shows no signs of slowing , with the number of confirmed cases now at over 40,000 worldwide and the death toll at 910 . 
The vast majority of the deaths have been in mainland China , leaving the country in something of a bizarre situation where some areas of it will be returning to something approaching business as usual , even as other regions face increasingly draconian restrictions on their movement and behavior in a desperate attempt to contain the virus . 
Drastic measures : In a joint statement Saturday , China 's National Health Commission , Supreme Court and Ministry of Public Security announced seven " medical related crimes " that would be severely punished . 
They include attacking medical personnel , refusing medical checks and damaging or destroying property at medical facilities . 
According to the statement , anyone who violates new virus control regulations will be quickly prosecuted and could face arrest , jail or even the death penalty .
