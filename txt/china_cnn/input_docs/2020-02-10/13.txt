Kia Motors suspended nearly all production lines at its three South Korea factories today , a Kia Motors spokesperson told CNN . 
The three plants , located in the cities of Gwangmyeong , Hwaseong and Gwangju , are suspended due to " the problem of wiring harness supplies from China , " said the spokesperson . 
One exception is the production line for military vehicles in the Gwangju factory , which is still operating . 
Production lines at the Hwaseong factory will resume Tuesday , and lines at the two other plants will resume Wednesday , Kia Motors said . 
Outbreak hits auto industry : China is a major supplier of parts to auto plants around the world -- shipping nearly $ 35 billion worth of parts in 2018 . 
But plants across China have been closed for weeks in response to the coronavirus outbreak -- and that could mean factories around the world grinding to a halt . 
Hyundai also has shut its assembly plants in South Korea , not because the disease itself has spread there but because it ca not keep the plants operating without Chinese parts .
