There are 66 newly confirmed coronavirus cases aboard the Diamond Princess ship docked in Yokohama , according to an announcement just made by the ship â€™s captain Stefano Ravera . 
That brings the total number of cases on the ship to 136 , nearly doubling the previous total of 70 confirmed cases yesterday . 
Ravera cautioned that this does not mean that the quarantine is not working . 
" It was not unexpected , the additional cases , involving individuals exposed prior to the start of the quarantine , " he said . 
Japanese authorities are still testing hundreds of passengers on board the ship , which has been stuck at the harbor south of the capital Tokyo for almost a week now . 
Evidence is increasingly pointing to a full blown outbreak on board the ship , the largest outside of mainland China , where the vast majority of cases have been reported until now .
