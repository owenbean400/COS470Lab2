It has been three weeks since Wu Chen went into self enforced quarantine in his Wuhan apartment , with only his cat , Baozi , for company . 
Since January 13 , the 26 year old graphic designer has only ventured outside his apartment a few times , to stock up on supplies of food and protective face masks -- and to collect food for his cat . 
He is one of millions of people who are all but confined to their homes in Wuhan and several other Chinese cities , under an unprecedented lockdown with no sign of ending . 
Life under lockdown : Justin Steece , an American teacher in Wuhan , wears a face mask over his nose and mouth and sunglasses to protect his eyes when he goes out . 
He also puts on an extra layer of clothing , which is then washed once he gets back home . 
At the supermarket , there is a small selection of food -- fresh produce is a rare find . 
Any shopping bags he uses are carefully wiped down with soap . 
Killing time : As the weeks drag on , Chinese social media has been flooded with videos of citizens entertaining themselves by square dancing in their living rooms , or re enacting Chinese operas . 
Wu Chen has joined in , posting daily videos on Tik Tok . 
In one video , he plays hide and seek with his cat .
