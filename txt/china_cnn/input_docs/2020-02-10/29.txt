The coronavirus outbreak is driving up the cost of food — and almost everything else in China — adding to the pressure on household budgets . 
China 's consumer price inflation hit 5.4 % in January , according to the country 's National Bureau of Statistics today . 
Prices rose last month at their fastest rate since October 2011 , when China was battling to control months of soaring inflation . 
Food , which makes up nearly a third of spending by Chinese consumers , is spiking the most : Pork — a mainstay in the Chinese diet that is already under pressure because of a devastating pig disease — skyrocketed a staggering 116 % compared to a year ago . Vegetables were 17 % more expensive . 
Other items saw modest price rises by comparison : Health care was 2.3 % more expensive , for example , while clothing prices rose 0.6 % . 
The statistics bureau acknowledged the role coronavirus played in causing prices to surge . 
In a statement , it attributed the increase to the outbreak and to the Lunar New Year holiday , which was observed in January this year rather than February , as it was in 2019 .
