There are at least 24 Americans among the 135 people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship , according to information from Princess Cruises and a CNN tally . 
Japanese authorities are still testing hundreds of passengers on board the ship , which has been stuck at a harbor south of Japanese capital Tokyo for almost a week now . 
Evidence is increasingly pointing to a full blown outbreak on board the ship , the largest outside of mainland China , where the vast majority of cases have been reported until now .
