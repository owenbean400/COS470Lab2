Two new viewpoint papers published in the Journal of the American Heart Association today turn a spotlight on how certain blood pressure medications may be associated with more severe Covid 19 infections — but still , it is important that patients continue taking their medications as prescribed , they say . 
The papers focus on the types of drugs known as ACE inhibitors or ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs , which " upregulate " an enzyme called ACE2 . 
It turns out that the novel coronavirus that causes Covid 19 enters the body 's cells through ACE2 . 
Therefore there has been some speculation that heart and blood pressure medications that influence ACE2 could put patients at increased risk of severe Covid 19 infections — but until more research is conducted , doctors urge patients to keep taking their medicine . 
" Taken together , ACE2 plays a protective role in both cardiovascular diseases and acute lung injury . 
For uninfected patients , we tend to believe it is unnecessary to discontinue ACEIs/ARBs given the lack of evidence to support the hypothesis that ACEIs/ARBs might lead to an increased risk of SARS Co V 2 infection , " authors Junyi Guo , Zheng Huang , Li Lin and Jiagao Lv wrote in one of the papers published Wednesday . 
The authors are from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan , China , where the coronavirus pandemic began . 
They added that infected patients also should not discontinue their medications but there is no immediate need for an infected patient not already taking the medication to initiate use . 
Both papers call for more research into this issue .
