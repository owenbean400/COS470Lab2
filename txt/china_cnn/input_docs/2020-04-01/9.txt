Vice President Mike Pence sought to cast blame on the Centers for Disease Control and China when pressed by CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer on why the US was so late in understanding the enormity of the coronavirus pandemic . 
" I will be very candid with you and say that in mid January the CDC was still assessing that the risk of the coronavirus to the American people was low . 
The very first case , which was someone who had been in China – in late January around the 20th day of January , " Pence said . 
He continued : Pressed again by Blitzer , he later added , " The reality is that we could ’ve been better off if China had been more forthcoming , " adding that the " outbreak was real in China … long before the world learned in December . "
