Indonesia plans to vaccinate 9 million people with an experimental vaccine developed by Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech in December , a senior government minister announced Wednesday . 
Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said vaccinations " would likely start in the third week of December 2020 . " 
The vaccination drive is separate from Phase 3 clinical trials for Sinovac , taking place in West Java in conjunction with Indonesia 's state owned biotechnology company Bio Farma . 
Indonesian authorities said the vaccinations will put the country on track to lift restrictions in popular tourist destination Bali -- planned to reopen in early 2021 . 
" We are keen to see Bali become a green zone , which is our target . 
We are optimistic that Bali is becoming a green zone at the start of next year , as we will commence vaccinations in the third week of December , " Panjaitan remarked . 
Indonesia has recorded a total of 421,731 coronavirus cases and 14,259 deaths since the start of the pandemic , according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University .
