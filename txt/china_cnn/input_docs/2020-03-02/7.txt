China 's factories are reeling from the coronavirus outbreak . 
Manufacturing activity in the country fell to record lows last month , according to a closely watched private survey . 
The media group Caixin said Monday that China 's manufacturing purchasing managers index sank to 40.3 in February , down from January 's 51.1 and the lowest reading since the survey began in 2004 . 
It was also well below the 45.7 that analysts polled by Reuters expected . 
The Caixin survey came days after the Chinese government reported that its official manufacturing PMI plunged in February to an all time low of 35.7 , down from January 's reading of 50 . 
The official non manufacturing PMI survey , which measures the services sector , skidded to 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January . 
Caixin 's services survey will release later this week . 
What this means : A reading above the 50 point level indicates growth compared to the previous month , while anything lower shows a contraction . 
Shutdown impact hits : A government imposed factory shutdown weighed heavily on the manufacturing sector 's performance , according to Caixin , which also said that travel restrictions hurt the labor market and left firms struggling to fill roles last month . 
Production , new orders and staffing levels all fell at the quickest rates on record . 
The media group also said supply chains took a big hit , adding that average delivery times for goods increased at a record pace .
