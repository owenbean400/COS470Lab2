US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said of the 14 original positive cases of coronavirus in the United States , all are recovered or recovering . 
" We ’ve seen an increase of cases in the United States over the weekend . 
I want folks to understand that we knew this was coming , we told folks that this was going to happen and it is why we ’ve been preaching preparedness from the very start , " Adams said . 
Noting that containment strategies such as limiting travel have worked so far , " Our containment strategies were focused on limiting travel back and forth the most affected regions in China . " 
With many other countries reporting coronavirus cases , " we cannot hermetically seal the United States . 
So in addition to trying to contain virus entry into the United States from places that are most affected , we ’re encouraging communities to think about the steps they can take to limit spread . "
