As the coronavirus outbreak stabilizes in China , attractions and hotels are slowly getting back to business . 
According to Ctrip , China ’s leading travel site , about 25 % of the China based attractions on its platform have begun receiving visitors again . 
These attractions include the Top of Shanghai Observatory at Shanghai Tower -- the tallest building in China -- and the Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower observation deck , both of which reopened doors to tourists on Thursday . 
Visitors to both towers are required to wear face masks and will have their temperatures taken at the door . 
They must also show their personal color coded mobile QR code -- a system recently implemented by China to monitor citizens ’ quarantine status -- before entering .
