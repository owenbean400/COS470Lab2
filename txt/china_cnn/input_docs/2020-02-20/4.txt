Only 349 cases of the novel coronavirus were reported today in Hubei , the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak -- the lowest number of new infections officially recorded there by China in weeks . 
There are now just over 62,000 cases of the virus in Hubei . 
The official data on the virus released by Chinese officials continues to trend positive , but there is some uncertainty of how cases are being diagnosed in Hubei , with the criteria for diagnosing the virus outside of the lab shifting in recent weeks . 
Chinese authorities this week switched back to reporting only laboratory confirmed cases from Hubei , after last week allowing clinical diagnoses by doctors -- based on symptoms or more immediate tests -- to be counted towards the province 's totals . 
The total number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus also rose , with more than 10,000 released from hospital in the province . 
China ’s National Health Commission is expected to release figures for all of China ’s provinces later today . 
' Greater outbreak ' avoided ? : In recent days , Chinese state media has lauded the success of the country 's authorities in containing the virus . 
For the first time on Tuesday , the number of patients discharged from hospitals exceeded new confirmed cases , state news agency Xinhua reported . 
On Monday , a meeting of top government officials presided over by Premier Li Keqiang declared that a " greater outbreak " had been avoided , while state tabloid Global Times ran a series of articles announcing a " slow , steady economic reboot " after several weeks of disruption .
