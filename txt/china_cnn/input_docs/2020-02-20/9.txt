Researchers in China are saying that people with the novel coronavirus may have the same viral load -- or amount of virus in their body -- whether or not they are actually showing symptoms of illness . 
In a letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine , the researchers describe how they monitored viral loads of the virus in samples taken from the nose and throat of 18 patients : nine men and nine women ranging in age from 26 to 76 in Zhuhai , in China â€™s Guangdong province . 
Their analysis showed that the 17 patients with symptoms had a similar viral load in tests to the one patient who had no symptoms . 
" ( This ) suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients , " the researchers wrote in the letter . 
" These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection . "
