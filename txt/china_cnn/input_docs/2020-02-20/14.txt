One day after announcing the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters from China , the Chinese foreign ministry is standing by its decision , saying people who " maliciously smear China must pay their price . " 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said yesterday that the press credentials for the three journalists would be revoked over an opinion piece titled " China Is The Real Sick Man of Asia . " 
It was written by a US academic and was critical of China 's handling of the coronavirus epidemic , questioning what the consequences could be for the economy and political system . 
Speaking today , Geng said the government was not interested when responding to a question about why the three journalists were kicked out for an opinion article they had no connection to . 
When asked , Geng did not directly link Beijing â€™s decision on the WSJ reporters to a US State Department move Tuesday , which requires five Chinese state media outlets to comply with rules governing foreign embassies and consulates .
