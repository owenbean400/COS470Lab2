The drop in new novel coronavirus infections out of mainland China was sharp today , falling from 1,749 confirmed cases on Wednesday to just 394 Thursday . 
This now appears to be partly due to a change in what is counted as a " confirmed case . " 
About a week ago , Hubei province began counting " clinically diagnosed patients " in their case numbers -- those patients who showed symptoms , even if they tested negative . 
It resulted in a huge spike of confirmed cases in the province , which is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak . 
However , according to the latest government guidelines , " clinically diagnosed patients " will no longer be counted . 
A lab based diagnosis will now be required for a case to be counted as " confirmed . " 
All other cases will be categorized as " suspected cases . " 
Comments carried in Chinese state media have said that the decision to include clinically diagnosed patients was intended to help clear a backlog of cases in Hubei . 
Diagnosis delays : For weeks , Hubei citizens with symptoms had expressed frustration that they were not able to get treatment due to a delay in diagnosis . 
Those delays could be significant , with some reports of patients waiting up to a week for their results , as the testing kits were sent from Hubei to a lab in Beijing . 
While there have been efforts to speed up the process , scientific testing of samples is difficult and time consuming .
