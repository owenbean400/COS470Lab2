China has cut a key lending rate today as the country tries to shore up the economy and thwart long term damage from the coronavirus outbreak . 
The People ’s Bank of China cut its one year loan prime rate ( LPR ) to 4.05 % from 4.15 % . 
It also lowered its five year rate to 4.75 % from 4.8 % . 
The LPR , which banks charge corporate clients for new loans , is a new benchmark that China introduced in August . 
Thursday ’s cuts were widely expected -- the economy has been slowing down and the coronavirus has been damaging to business this year . 
Billions in losses : China ’s central bank will likely keep loosening its purse strings in the coming weeks , according to analysts at Capital Economics . 
They pointed out that the coronavirus has started to weigh on employment . 
" But rate cuts alone will provide limited relief to the millions of small private firms that are suffering the most from the epidemic and are poorly served by the formal banking , " the analysts added . 
Some analysts and state run media have already said that the coronavirus fallout could cost the Chinese economy a few percentage points of growth . 
In dollar terms , that could lose the country more than $ 60 billion .
