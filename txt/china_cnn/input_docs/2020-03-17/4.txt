Factories were shuttered and streets were cleared across China 's Hubei province as authorities ordered residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus .

Satellite images by NASA and the European Space Agency show a dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions -- those released by vehicles , power plants and industrial facilities -- in major Chinese cities between January and February .

Coal consumption dropped dramatically . 
Major coal fired power stations saw huge drops in consumption , likely because electricity demand is down . 
Burning fossil fuels like coal emits carbon dioxide -- and emissions were down by at least 25 % from February 3 to March 1 , according to air pollution research group Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ) . 
But some are worried that once the coronavirus threat passes , China will be solely focused on restarting its economy , and the pollution will return in full force .
