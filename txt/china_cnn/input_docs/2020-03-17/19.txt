The drastic measures enforced by China during the coronavirus outbreak have slashed deadly air pollution , potentially saving the lives of tens of thousands of people , according to a Stanford University researcher . 
Marshall Burke , an assistant professor at Stanford 's Department of Earth System Science , said the better air quality could have saved between 50,000 and 75,000 people from dying prematurely . 
The scientist quantified the improved air quality in four Chinese cities and , using data gathered around the 2008 Beijing Olympics when Chinese authorities implemented strict pollution controls on industry and transportation , calculated the estimated improvement in premature deaths for children under 5 and people over 70 . 
Burke calculated that the two months of cleaner air has saved the lives of between 1,400 and 4,000 kids under 5 and 51,700 to 73,000 adults over 70 in China . 
He said that while the cleaner air likely saved lives , the broader disruption caused by COVID 19 could cause many additional deaths that are not directly attributable to being infected with the virus . 
" Does this mean pandemics are good for health ? 
No , " he said . 
" Instead it means that the way our economies operate absent pandemics has massive hidden health costs , and it takes a pandemic to help see that . "
