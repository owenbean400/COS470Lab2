Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the " the United States government is working diligently " to figure out the origin of the coronavirus . 
The top US diplomat said that the Chinese government needs to " open up . " 
" They say they want to cooperate . 
One of the best ways they could find to cooperate would be to let the world in , to let the world â€™s scientists know exactly how this came to be , exactly how this virus began to spread , " Pompeo said . 
Some context : CNN has reported that US intelligence and national security officials say the US government is looking into the possibility that the novel coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory rather than a market , according to multiple sources familiar with the matter . 
Those sources caution it is premature to draw any conclusions . 
The US does not believe the virus was associated with bioweapons research , and officials noted that the intelligence community is also exploring a range of other theories regarding the origination of the virus , as would typically be the case for high profile incidents , according to an intelligence source .
