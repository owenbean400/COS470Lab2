British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has called for a " deep dive " review of China 's early handling of the coronavirus outbreak , telling reporters on Thursday that his government will have to " ask the hard questions " on how the pandemic came about . 
" There is no doubt that we cannot have business as usual after this crisis and we will have to ask the hard questions about how it came about and how it could have been stopped earlier , " Raab added . 
The foreign secretary cautioned that while there remain questions about the initial outbreak of the virus , the UK government " ought to look at all sides " in a " balanced way " that is driven by scientific evidence . 
" One thing that coronavirus has taught us is the value and the importance of international cooperation , " Raab said . 
" We had very good cooperation with the Chinese in relation to the return of UK nationals at the outset from Wuhan , as we have on the procurement of things that we need , " he said .
