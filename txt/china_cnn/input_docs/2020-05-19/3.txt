Hunan province in southern China has announced a scheme to buy wild animals from farmers as the country cracks down on the trade of wildlife for consumption . 
The initial outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has been linked to a wet market in Wuhan , capital of China 's central Hubei province , where a wide variety of wild animals were being sold as meat , including snakes , porcupines and raccoon dogs . 
Since then , China has been working to clamp down on the wild animal trade . 
In January , Chinese officials announced that the trading of wild animals would be temporarily suspended in hopes that would help contain the virus . 
The next month , China slapped a temporary ban on all farming and consumption of " terrestrial wildlife of important ecological , scientific and social value . " 
On Friday , the Hunan provincial government said it will offer compensation to wildlife farmers so they can switch to alternative forms of farming . 
Only farmers who obtained a license for the artificial breeding of wildlife are eligible , it said . 
The compensation varies depending on the species . 
Officials will pay 120 yuan ( $ 17 ) per kilogram of king rat snake , while a guinea pig is worth 24 yuan ( $ 3.40 ) . 
Jiangxi province in southeastern China announced a similar scheme last Saturday , but did not specify the compensation offered to its farmers . 
In a statement , animal protection group Humane Society International praised Hunan and Jiangxi for " demonstrating global leadership " on the issue , and urged other provinces and countries to follow suit .
