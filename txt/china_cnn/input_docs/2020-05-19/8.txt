Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Tuesday that his country is not interested in a trade war with China , after China announced crippling tariffs on Australian barley exports – a trade that is worth close to $ 600 million a year . 
The tariffs are the latest development in the deteriorating relationship between Canberra and Beijing , which began when Australia called for an international inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic . 
Even though the two sides say barley tariffs and the coronavirus inquiry are not linked , some are questioning whether Beijing ’s latest move is economic payback . 
Australia 's Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said Tuesday that Australia reserves its right to go to the World Trade Organization to mediate in the decision .
