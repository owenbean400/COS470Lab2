The Hong Kong government announced it would extend a ban on public gatherings -- established as part of coronavirus distancing measures -- an extra two weeks through June 4 , the day Hong Kong pro democracy advocates mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre . 
In light of concerns of experts , it is not the time for Hong Kong to relax the measures , Chan added . 
Hong Kong recently reported its first community transmission cases in weeks , calling into question the containment of the virus . 
Organizers of the annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil held in Hong Kong â€™s Victoria Park could still apply for permits to hold the event , but those are unlikely to be approved by the government on grounds of public health . 
Hong Kong is the only place on Chinese soil where major mass commemorations are held for the event .
