An international study of global carbon emissions found that daily emissions declined 17 % between January and early April , compared to average levels in 2019 , and could decline anywhere between 4.4 % to 8 % by the year 's end . 
Emissions have not been this low since 2006 . 
The study , which appeared today in the journal Nature Climate Change , centered on 69 countries , all 50 US states and 30 Chinese provinces , which account for 85 % of the world population and 97 % of all global carbon dioxide emissions . 
By the numbers : By the end of April , carbon emissions are estimated to have declined by 1,048 metric tons , according to the researchers -- that 's roughly 2,312,649 pounds . 
The decline is largest in China , where the pandemic began , where emissions dropped 533,500 plus pounds . 
In the US , carbon emissions declined by 456,350 plus pounds . 
China and the US are the two largest carbon emitters globally . 
By the end of the year , emissions will have declined somewhere between 4.4 % and 8 % , the researchers predict . 
It 's the most significant decline in over a decade , but it 's the result of forced changes , not the restructuring of global economies and energy . 
According to United Nations Environment projections , to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius , we need to reduce emissions by 7.6 % every single year between now and 2030 . 
Unclear trend : It 's not clear how long or severe the coronavirus pandemic will be , which makes it difficult to predict how emissions will be affected long term . 
And , because the changes driving reduced emissions have not fundamentally changed the economy or the energy much of the world relies on , the declines are likely to be temporary . 
Plus , 2020 is still on track to be one of the top five hottest years on record .
