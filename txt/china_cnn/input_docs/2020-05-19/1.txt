Volunteers who received Moderna 's Covid 19 vaccine had positive early results , according to the biotech company , which partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop the vaccine . 
If future studies go well , the company 's vaccine could be available to the public as early as January , said Moderna 's chief medical officer , Dr . Tal Zaks .

Two others , Pfizer and Inovio , are also in the United States , one is at the University of Oxford in Britain , and four are in China .
