President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed his attacks on the World Health Organization after the head of the organization asked him not to " politicize the virus . " 
At a press conference earlier Wednesday , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to attacks from Trump about how his organization handled the coronavirus outbreak . 
" Please do not politicize this virus ... 
If you do not want many more body bags , then you refrain from politicizing it . 
My short message is : Please quarantine politicizing Covid , " Ghebreyesus said . 
At Wednesday 's White House briefing , Trump declared it was Ghebreyesus who was politicizing the coronavirus and said he believes the organization favors China . 
Trump implied that there would have been fewer coronavirus deaths if the WHO gave a " correct analysis . " 
" I think when you say more body bags , I think we would have done , and he would have been much better serving the people that he â€™s supposed to serve if they gave a correct analysis , " Trump said .
