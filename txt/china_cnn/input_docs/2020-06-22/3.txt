China has suspended poultry imports from a Tyson Foods plant in the United States because of concerns about an outbreak of coronavirus at the facility . 
The country 's General Administration of Customs on Sunday said that Tyson confirmed a " cluster of Covid 19 infections among employees recently " at the plant , which it identified only by a registration number . 
Asked for comment , Tyson did not say which plant the Chinese government was referring to -- though the company told other media outlets that the announcement pertained to a plant on Berry Street in Springdale , Arkansas . 
The US Department of Agriculture has also used the same number to refer to a poultry plant at that location . 
Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for further details . 
The US company announced Friday that 481 of its workers recently tested positive for coronavirus at locations in Arkansas , nearly half of whom were at the Springdale plant . 
More than 3,700 people were tested in total , and all but 26 of the people who tested positive had no symptoms .
