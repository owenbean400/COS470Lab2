The European Union has revised the list of safe travel countries to 11 non member states after dropping Algeria from the list , according to a European Council Statement released Thursday . 
The EU will gradually lift the travel restrictions at the external borders for residents of Australia , Canada , Georgia , Japan , Morocco , New Zealand , Rwanda , South Korea , Thailand , Tunisia , and Uruguay , according to the statement . 
The United States remains on the list of restricted nations , and China is still pending approval based on reciprocity . 
The statement added that in order to be considered safe for travel , non EU nations must have coronavirus case numbers per 100,000 inhabitants that are close to or below the EU average over the last 14 days , as well as a stable or decreasing trend of new cases over that period in comparison to the previous 14 days . 
The EU is also taking into account other nations ' " overall response to COVID 19 , " including whether they have implemented reliable coronavirus testing , surveillance , contact tracing , containment , treatment and reporting . 
In nations where travel restrictions continue to apply , there are exemptions for EU citizens , long term EU residents , families of EU residents and citizens , and " travelers with an essential function or need . " 
The European Council said it will continue to regularly review the list of safe travel countries , adding , " Travel restrictions may be totally or partially lifted or reintroduced for a specific third country already listed according to changes in some of the conditions and , as a consequence , in the assessment of the epidemiological situation . 
If the situation in a listed third country worsens quickly , rapid decision making should be applied . " 
However , it remains up to EU member states to decide exactly how they implement any changes in border policy .
