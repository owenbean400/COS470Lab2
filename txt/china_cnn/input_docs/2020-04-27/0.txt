Before entering the cave , the small team of scientists pull on hazmat suits , face masks and thick gloves to cover every inch of their skin . 
Contact with bat droppings or urine could expose them to some of the world 's deadliest unknown viruses . 
Equipped with headlights , they set their nets up at the entrance of the dark opening overhung with bamboo trees , which is part of a vast system of limestone caves in China 's south western Yunnan province . 
Then they patiently wait for dusk . 
When the sun sets , thousands of bats fly out of the caves , looking for food -- and straight into their nets . 
Peter Daszak is a virus hunter . 
He presides over Eco Health Alliance , an American NGO which specializes in detecting new viruses and pandemic prevention . 
Over the past 10 years , he has visited over 20 countries trying to prevent the next big pandemic by searching bat caves for new pathogens . 
More specifically , new coronaviruses . 
The findings of Daszak , and others like him , inform an open source library of all known animal viruses , from which scientists can forecast which strains are most likely to spill over to humans , in order to ready the world for a new pandemic like Covid 19 . 
" We ( have ) collected more than 15,000 bat samples , which led to the identification of around 500 new coronaviruses , " he says . 
And one of those , found in a cave in China in 2013 , was a possible ancestor of Covid 19 .
