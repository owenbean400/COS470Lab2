Maatje Benassi , a US Army reservist and mother of two , has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic , saying she brought the disease to China . 
The false claims are spreading across You Tube every day , so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views , and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media . 
Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms , Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak , including among accounts that are known drivers of large scale coordinated activities by their followers .

It also serves as a powerful reminder that misinformation online , however wild or obviously untrue it may seem , can have real and lasting consequences offline .
