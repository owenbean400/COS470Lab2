The coronavirus continues to place huge strain on society as we know it , as its effects ripple around the world . 
Here are some of the latest developments : More flight cancellations : British Airways has suspended flights to and from London Gatwick airport , the second largest in the UK . 
Airlines have struggled during the coronavirus outbreak , cutting flights in response to travel restrictions and a sharp fall in demand . 
On Monday , European budget airline easy Jet announced it was grounding its entire fleet given the " unprecedented travel restrictions " caused by the pandemic . 
Virus strikes younger demographics : Australia and New Zealand say a high proportion of those diagnosed with coronavirus in those nations are young people . 
In New Zealand , 26 % of confirmed cases are in people aged 20 to 29 , and 21 % of cases in Australia involve those in the same age range . 
One possible explanation for the finding is overseas travel , which younger people engage in more than older demographics . 
In both New Zealand and Australia , the vast majority of cases recorded have been linked to overseas travel or other known cases , meaning there is limited transmission in the wider community . 
Coronavirus could drive millions into poverty : Countries in East Asia and the Pacific will be dealing with a recession if they do not act immediately to combat the economic shocks caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic , the World Bank is warning . 
It also estimates that the pandemic â€™s economic effects could drive millions of people in the region into poverty . 
Much of the world is now encountering economic difficulties , but the crisis is particularly acute in Asia Pacific because the region had already spent months dealing with the negative economic effects of the US China trade war .
