A new study may support the idea that men get sicker and are more likely to die from coronavirus than women . 
It â€™s a small study , done in China , and does not necessarily reflect what has happened elsewhere in the world . 
But it supports an early observation about Covid 19 when it first started spreading in China : men were more likely to die than women . 
The method : A team at Beijing Tongren Hospital and Wuhan Union Hospital studied 43 patients directly and the records of just over 1,000 others . 
What they found : Men and women seemed to get the disease at the same rate , but men were more than twice as likely to die , the team found . 
The study , published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health , gives little other detail . 
People who were older and those with more underlying health conditions fared worse than younger and healthier patients , the researchers found . 
More research needed : The authors concluded that the male gender is a risk factor for worse outcomes of Covid 19 , regardless of age and underlying health conditions . 
They said this will need to be studied with a larger group of patients to determine if it is accurate , although some earlier studies have noted a similar trend . 
Other factors could be at play : Scientists will also want to look at data from patients in other countries since there are demographic elements that could be a factor . 
In China , for example , 50 % of men smoke , compared to 5 % of women , according to earlier research , and smoking is thought to be tied to more severe cases of the disease . 
The study also does not explain why men fare worse with this disease .
