What is the NPC ? 
The National People ’s Congress is the country ’s rubber stamp parliament . 
Until this year , the annual plenary session -- one of the biggest events on the country 's political calendar -- had not been delayed or suspended since the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s . 
It went ahead as scheduled in 2003 amid the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) epidemic , which originated in China and hit the country hard . 
SARS eventually spread across the world to infect more than 8,000 people , killing at least 774 .
