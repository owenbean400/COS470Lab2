Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will end the state of emergency across the whole country tonight , he said in a briefing on Monday . 
Much of Japan entered the state of emergency on April 7 , as the country tried to rein in the coronavirus pandemic . 
It has since been lifted across most of the nation and businesses have reopened and social activities have slowly resumed . 
The country has recorded 16,550 cases of the virus and 820 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Abe will have a task force meeting Monday night after which the lifting of the state of emergency will take effect . 
Abe also announced he would put together a second supplementary budget on Wednesday , to boost the government 's stimulus packages . 
The amount provided by the two stimulus efforts comes to over 200 trillion yen ( $ 1.87 trillion ) . 
" The economic revival would be the first priority for my administration , " Abe said . 
Museums and sports facilities will open in Tokyo from Tuesday , the city 's governor Yuriko Koike said , while schools in the capital will reopen with a phased approach . 
While taking questions after the briefing Abe also discussed the Tokyo Olympics . 
He said that the development of a coronavirus vaccine was " significant " for the country being able to host the event in its complete form . 
The Games are scheduled to begin on July 23 2021 , after being postponed for a year due to the pandemic . 
The Japanese leader was also asked about the dispute between the US and China over the origins of Covid 19 . 
Abe said in response that he believed the coronavirus started in China .
