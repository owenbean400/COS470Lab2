The hugely popular K pop band BTS has cancelled four concerts in the South Korean capital Seoul due to fears over the spread of the coronavirus . 
The four concerts were set to take place in April , the group ’s management company announced on the band ’s official Facebook page . 
More than 200,000 people were expected to attend the shows . 
The band said that those who bought tickets will receive a full refund . 
The stakes of cancelling the Seoul tour are particularly high since the band recently released a new album and made high profile appearances on US television , including on Jimmy Fallon ’s " The Tonight Show . " 
South Korea has the largest outbreak outside of mainland China with more than 2,000 cases .
