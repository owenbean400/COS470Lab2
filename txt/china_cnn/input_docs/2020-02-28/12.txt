Chinese search giant Baidu ( BIDU ) warned Friday that its revenue could drop as much as 13 % this quarter compared to the same time last year . 
Revenue for its core business , which includes digital marketing and advertising , could plunge as much as 18 % year over year , according to the company 's guidance . 
The online ad industry is expected to be one of the biggest " losers " of the outbreak , noted Chelsey Tam , an equity analyst at Morningstar . 
The outbreak comes at a particularly vulnerable time for Baidu . 
Over the past year , its main business has already been squeezed by increased regulation of online content in China , as well as the country 's broader economic slowdown . 
The firm has been trying to turn things around , and its fourth quarter earnings on Friday beat expectations . 
But it 's still not clear how much the coronavirus will take a toll . 
" The coronavirus situation in China is evolving , " Baidu said in a statement . 
" Business visibility is very limited . "
