A woman in her 70s is the fifth passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship to die from the novel coronavirus , Japan â€™s Health Ministry said Friday . 
A top Japanese government adviser told CNN this week that the quarantine measures enacted on the Diamond Princess , which was docked off Yokohama for two weeks , may have allowed additional infections to spread among the ship 's crew and passengers . 
The American owned cruise ship was put under quarantine by Japan after a coronavirus outbreak was detected on board . 
At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine . 
For a time , the ship had the largest concentration of cases outside of mainland China , where the virus is thought to have originated . 
Japan has now confirmed 10 deaths from the coronavirus .
