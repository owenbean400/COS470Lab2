The US Food and Drug Administration says there are currently no known shortages on medical devices within the US market . 
The agency says it contacted 63 manufacturers which represent 72 facilities in China that produce essential medical devices , according to Stephen Hahn FDA Commissioner . 
The agency noted an increased market demand for some products which could include surgical gowns , gloves , masks , and respirator protective devices . 
Mark Bonifacio — founder of Bonifacio Consulting services , a group that works with medical devices and contract manufacturers — says coronavirus is not having an immediate effect on the medical device industry . 
" There is no effect . 
Companies have deep inventory benches and a two week shutdown does not show up on the radar as long as you can catch up quickly " said Bonifacio . 
" If this continues , it will be a different story . " 
Most factories in China were already shutdown because of the Chinese Lunar New Year . 
The coronavirus has added about an additional two weeks of inactivity , sad Bonifacio .
