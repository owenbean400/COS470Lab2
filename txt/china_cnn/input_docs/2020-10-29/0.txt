The coronavirus pandemic has left governments in disarray and made planning even weeks ahead difficult . 
In Beijing this week , however , China 's leaders met to set specific policy for much of the coming decade . 
In a series of closed door meetings in the capital , top Chinese Communist Party officials hashed out the country 's next five year plan -- and even drew up a " vision " for 2035 , a long term proposal for the year which President Xi Jinping has set as a deadline for China to " basically achieve socialist modernization . " 
Whatever is agreed at the plenum , by a tiny cohort of leaders , will shape policy for the entire country of 1.3 billion people , implemented at all levels by Communist Party bureaucrats , state controlled enterprises , and the all powerful security state . 
While full details of the fresh five year plan may not be unveiled until China 's rubber stamp parliament meets next year , key goals that have been previewed in state media include a pivot away from GDP growth at all costs , cutting carbon emissions and achieving self sufficiency in technology and science , amid increasing pressure from the United States on that front . 
This kind of long term planning is in contrast to the often flip flopping nature of democracies , where promises and plans set in place by one government are vulnerable to being undone by the next -- a point often highlighted in Chinese state media to defend the legitimacy of Beijing 's authoritarian system . 
Few American presidents have put this into starker relief than Donald Trump , who upon taking office scrapped a major trade deal , withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord , and set about dismantling the Iran nuclear agreement , essentially reversing all the long term policy established by the Obama administration .
