China 's Hubei province , the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak , will allow businesses to gradually come back online and will resume some public transportation services , the provincial government said in a statement Wednesday . 
The decision comes as the number of cases in the province has declined significantly . 
Hubei was reporting thousands of infections a day just weeks ago . There were only 14 new infections reported in Hubei Tuesday , according to China 's National Health Commission . 
Businesses in Wuhan -- the provincial capital and the city where the virus was first identified -- that are related to epidemic control , public utilities and daily necessities are allowed to resume work now , the statement said . 
Other firms can return to work starting on March 20 . 
The provincial government said that regions outside Wuhan will be divided into areas of high , medium and low risk . 
The order of work resumption will depend on the nature of businesses and where they are located . 
Meanwhile , business that involve people gathering in small spaces -- like karaoke bars , movie theaters and beauty salons -- will not be allowed to reopen until after the outbreak is over . 
Areas where the risk is deemed medium or low will be allowed to gradually resume public transportation services like city buses and flights between provinces . 
However , public transportation in Wuhan and other high risk areas will continue to be suspended until further notice , it said . 
Schools across Hubei province will continue to be suspended until further notice and checkpoints will remain in place for those wishing to enter or leave Hubei .
