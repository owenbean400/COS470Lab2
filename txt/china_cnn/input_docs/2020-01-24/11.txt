With global attention on the Wuhan coronavirus and its spread around China and other countries , it 's important to put it in the context of other deadly infections , including seasonal influenza , which claims the lives of thousands of people every year . 
According to a September 2019 study by Chinese scientists in The Lancet , there are an average of around 88,100 influenza related deaths every year in China , with a mortality rate of between 1.6 % and 2.6 % . 
The majority of those who died as a result of the flu were aged over 60 , the report said . 
While the true extent of the new coronavirus is unclear , it appears to be more deadly than seasonal influenza . 
Of the 846 confirmed cases , there have been 26 deaths , a mortality rate of 3 % . 
However , that is far less deadly than related coronaviruses SARS and MERS . 
SARS has a mortality rate of around 10 % , while MERS has killed 34 % of those infected with that virus .
