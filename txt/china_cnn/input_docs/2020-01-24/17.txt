Hong Kong is facing a serious shortage of face masks as fears over the Wuhan coronavirus has seen a rise in demand . 
Horace Lau , the vice president of Hong Kong â€™s General Chamber of Pharmacies , told CNN the next batch of face masks is not expected until February . 
" The supply of face masks during the Lunar New Year is highly uncertain , " he said . 
He added that Hong Kong imports most of its face masks from China , Taiwan and Malaysia , so , if China stops their exports of face masks , supply will be tight . 
Deliveries could also be affected by the Lunar New Year holiday in both China and Hong Kong . 
Lau said that in his own shop he sold over 10,000 boxes of 50 face masks in the last week alone . 
The price of face masks in pharmacies has already started to rise , he added .
