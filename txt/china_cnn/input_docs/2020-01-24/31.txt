Anthony Fauci , from the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , spoke briefly to reporters ahead of the coronavirus briefing on Capitol Hill Friday . 
Fauci , who is the director of the national institute of allergies and infectious diseases at the agency , said that he feels China is being more transparent with the world this time than it was during previous outbreaks , such as the 2003 SARS outbreak . 
Fauci said that China 's decision to shut down travel may not have a huge impact on containing the spread , but " it â€™s their judgment that this is something that in fact is going to help . "
