Authorities in China are reportedly planning to build a dedicated pneumonia hospital in Wuhan to help treat the hundreds of people affected by the deadly coronavirus in that city . 
According to the Beijing News , a state backed newspaper , the hospital will be a prefabricated , box type model that can be built in six days . 
A design plan will be released on Friday , the paper said , with construction due to begin soon afterward in Wuhan 's southwestern Caidian District . 
During the 2003 SARS crisis , Xiaotangshan Hospital was constructed in six days and seven nights in Beijing . 
Dedicated to tackling that virus , it was used to treat almost 700 SARS patients , only eight of whom died , a mortality rate of 1.18 % , far below the national average .
