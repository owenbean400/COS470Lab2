Central government authorities in China are asking people for information about any underreporting or concealment of the facts around the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak , according to state broadcaster CGTN . 
There have been numerous allegations that officials in Wuhan downplayed the virus in the initial weeks following its discovery . 
During the 2003 SARS outbreak , which originated in the southern province of Guangdong , local officials there and elsewhere in China actively covered up the extent and danger of that virus . 
According to CGTN , China 's State Council said it is " welcoming information from citizens about potential issues with the reporting of the new coronavirus . "
