Disney will require guests to wear masks , except when dining , and go through temperature screenings as well as use the government issued Shanghai Health QR code , a contact tracing and early detection system used in China . 
Disney said it will also control guest density , limit attendance with an advanced reservation and entry system , increase sanitization and disinfection measures , and train employees on contactless guest interaction . 
Disney Parks Chief Medical Officer , Dr . Pamela Hymel , said in a statement to guests that this is " an encouraging sign for Disney parks and retail locations all over the world . " 
Hymel said that the company is working on a plan for domestic US parks to reopen in phases , including the use of virtual queues . 
Hymel did not specify whether guests to US Disney theme parks might have to wear face masks , but said , " We 'll follow guidance from the government and the medical community regarding enhanced screening measures and prevention measures , including those related to personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , such as face coverings .
