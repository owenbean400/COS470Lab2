Many of the early Covid 19 cases imported into the UK came from European countries , rather than China , the UK government ’s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said Tuesday . 
" They actually came from European imports and the high level of travel into the UK around that time , " he explained -- despite the UK ’s initial focus on contact tracing which concentrated on arrivals from China . 
The first two cases of coronavirus in the UK were confirmed by England ’s chief medical officer , Chris Witty , on January 31 . 
When asked whether the UK should have imposed a lockdown earlier than March 23 , Vallance said : " when you look at everything that happened and the speed at which it happened , maybe days either way would have made a difference . " 
Vallance said that the UK has not yet managed to get the reproduction rate of the virus -- known as the R rate -- down to a manageable number , whereby the virus could be controlled using contact tracing and isolation . 
He said the country 's lockdown should not be lifted until this outcome is achieved . 
The UK must review its lockdown measures by Thursday , but is not expected to announce major changes yet .
