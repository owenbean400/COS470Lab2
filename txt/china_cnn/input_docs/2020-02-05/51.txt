Public health experts have criticized a report , published last week , that suggested the coronavirus could spread before the onset of symptoms . 
The study had seemed to confirm earlier statements from Chinese officials that the virus could spread asymptomatically . 
In an email to CNN on Tuesday , German public health officials said the report was incorrect . 
Marc Lipsitch , a Harvard public health professor , said the error had likely been because the authors were " inadequately careful ... an error that is understandable in a crisis situation , but is still problematic . " 
The Public Health Agency of Sweden also called the study 's conclusions " based on misconceptions , " adding that it had not provided " scientifically substantiated facts . "
