The British government has urged all of its citizens in China to leave the country , but offered little more in detailed information or practical advice . 
What they said : In a statement yesterday , the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said it " now recommends that British Nationals who are able to leave China do so , " citing the coronavirus outbreak as the reason for the advisory . 
UK citizens in China should leave " to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus , " said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in the statement . 
What they did not say : The statement gave little more detail on what prompted the additional urgency , whether there was new medical information about the virus spread , or even how tens of thousands of Britons in China might go about leaving . 
Other countries have suspended travel to mainland China and barred entry to travelers coming from China , but the UK is the first to ask its citizens to leave the country entirely . 
Chinese response : China has not responded specifically to the updated UK advisory , but it has lashed out at other countries for taking stringent measures against the coronavirus . 
It accused the US of overreacting and feeding mass hysteria by banning Chinese travelers and evacuating its consulate staff from China . 
" We hope countries will make reasonable , calm and science based judgments and responses , " said a Chinese official on Monday .
