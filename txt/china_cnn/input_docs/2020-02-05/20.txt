All travelers entering Hong Kong from mainland China will be placed under quarantine for 14 days , Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced at a news conference today . 
The rule includes Hong Kong and mainland residents , Lam said . 
There are 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the semi autonomous city , of which three are locally infected cases -- suggesting transmission between the community , rather than being brought in from somewhere else . 
Travel restrictions : The government suspended four more border crossings yesterday , which has seen entries by travelers from mainland China drop by 60 % , Lam said . 
However , the city cannot close all borders because many of the arrivals from the mainland are Hong Kong residents who need to return into the city , she said . 
Besides , Hong Kong relies on the mainland for crucial supplies including food . 
What the government has done : The government will allocate over 10 billion Hong Kong dollars ( about $ 1.3 billion ) in resources to fight the outbreak , Lam said . 
It has already closed most of Hong Kong 's borders with the mainland -- but many in the medical field say that 's not enough , and have been on strike for three days .
