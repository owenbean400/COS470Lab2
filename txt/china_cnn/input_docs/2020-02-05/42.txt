The 12th US person with a confirmed case of Wuhan coronavirus is isolated at home in Wisconsin , according to officials at UW Health . 
Safdar said the medical center has a " very involved protocol that was put into play " when the patient sought care at UW Health on Jan . 30 . 
" When somebody comes in , they ’re asked questions about travel history , whether they traveled to the relevant areas in question and whether they have symptoms of a respiratory nature , " Safdar said . 
" When there ’s a positive answer to those questions they are taken back into a private room , that ’s called a negative pressure room to prevent spreading the virus to anyone else . 
The health care workers that enter the room are fully garbed up with gowns , gloves , eye protection and face masks . " 
Wisconsin ’s Division of Public Health and UW Health are investigating the patient ’s close contacts . 
The patient is an adult who traveled from Beijing and was exposed to known cases while in China , UW Health said in an earlier news release .
