It 's a beautiful morning at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County , California . 
A handful of people are out and about on the grounds , including 27 year old Jarred Evans . 
After his morning run , Evans may settle in with his laptop in the hotel where he 's staying on base and do some work for his business . 
If he were so inclined , he could even go to a Zumba or kickboxing class to pass the time . 
For the most part , though , he and everyone else at the hotel are keeping to themselves . 
They are under quarantine , after all . 
Evans and 194 other people were evacuated from Wuhan aboard a chartered flight on January 28 to escape the rapidly spreading coronavirus . 
The passengers from Evans ' flight are one of several groups that have been quarantined after entering through the US airports designated to receive passengers from areas in China affected by the virus . 
From those airports , groups are taken to military bases , hotels or other sites to wait out a federally mandated 72 hour quarantine .
