" In the last 24 hours , we had the most cases in a single day since the outbreak started , " the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday , in a press conference detailing the latest developments of the coronavirus outbreak . 
The director general referred to case numbers the WHO had recorded by 6 a.m . Geneva time Wednesday , adding the relatively small number of infections outside China gave " a window of opportunity to prevent this outbreak from becoming a broader global crisis . " 
" Our greatest concern is about the potential for spread in countries with weaker health systems , and who lack the capacity to detect or diagnose the virus . 
We are only as strong as the weakest link , " he said .
