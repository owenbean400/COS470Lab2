Editor 's note : Yuli Yang is a Hong Kong based journalist who worked for CNN , BBC and Al Jazeera in greater China for over a decade . 
I am a Wuhan girl living in Hong Kong . 
Right now , my close family is all under lockdown in my hometown , the epicenter of this epidemic . 
Every day , I worry for their safety , their health and their mental well being . 
They worry , too , that I am worried about them . 
Sound familiar ? 
I 'm sure anyone living far away from their parents can relate to this funny cycle of love . 
I 'm also a news producer and aware of the blame , the frustration and the outrage that circulates in the wake of a crisis . 
I 'm grateful for my tireless , fellow journalists , who keep the world abreast of the battle against this coronavirus outbreak . 
I understand and support the physical measures that airlines , governments and institutions have put in place for control and prevention . 
But at the same time , I invite you not to put up walls between our hearts . 
By this , I 'm referring to the emerging trend around the world of discrimination towards Chinese people , and towards those who simply look like us . 
This virus brings death and fear . 
People see the infection spread across borders and they grow afraid for their children , parents , for themselves . 
But the virus also reveals an amazing truth -- that we 're all interconnected , so much more closely than we might have thought .
