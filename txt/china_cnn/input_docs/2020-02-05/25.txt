Why they 're striking : The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance , a union representing medical workers in the city , is on its third day of strike action .

Government response : Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam criticized the strikers for weakening the city 's medical capacity at a crucial time . 
Remaining employees still working in the hospital now have a heavier workload to make up for their absent colleagues , she said .
