As medical workers in Hong Kong continue their strike , the Hong Kong Hospital Authority said today that the limited number of staff meant public hospitals could only offer emergency services . 
With such limited services , the Hospital Authority asked patients with mild conditions to see private hospitals or doctors , or specialist outpatient clinics , according to a statement from the government Wednesday . 
Why they 're striking : The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance , a union representing medical workers in the city , is on its third day of a strike . 
Strikers and union members are demanding closed borders with mainland China , and have accused the city government of inadequate action during the coronavirus outbreak . 
Government response : Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam criticized the strikers for weakening the city 's medical capacity at a crucial time . 
Remaining employees still working in the hospital now have a heavier workload to make up for their absent colleagues , she said yesterday . 
The government has already implemented travel restrictions and shut down most of its borders with neighboring mainland China -- only three crossing points remain open , including the international airport .
