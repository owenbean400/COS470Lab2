Spain has bought $ 467 million worth of medical supplies from China , the Spanish health minister said on Wednesday . 
Health Minister Salvador Illa said Spain 's President " talked over the phone with China 's President a few days ago , and since then the whole government has been working together to sign this contract and make this buy . " 
The equipment includes 550 million masks , 5.5 million " quick tests , " 950 ventilators and 11 million gloves . 
The supplies should cover the medical needs in Spain for about four to eight weeks , Illa said . 
The minister also announced two companies in Spain are already producing medical equipment as well . 
In response to the rise in deaths , which have surpassed China 's numbers , Illa said : " We said this week would be tough , the numbers are tough . 
It is likely that the number of deaths will increase for a few more days until we reach the peak " . 
Spain now has at least 3,434 deaths from coronavirus , but authorities say the number of hospitalized patients is " stabilizing . " 
Fernando Sim√≥n , chief of the Center for Emergencies , explained in Wednesday 's news conference that the rate of infection is slowing down , " which means we are not far from the national peak . " 
" Regarding the increase in new cases , if we are not at the peak already , we are very close , " he said .
