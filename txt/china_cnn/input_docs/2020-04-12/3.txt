South Korea announced Sunday that the government will form a vaccine development support group this week , which will involve members of government , academia , industry , research institutions and hospitals . 
The joint support group will be led by the Ministries of Health and Science to form a quick decision making system to aid in the development of treatment in South Korea . 
Earlier in the week , President Moon Jae in held a meeting during which he vowed to " provide all the financial , administrative , and policy support " for the development of a vaccine , according to Health Minister Park Neung hoo . 
" If we put their efforts together , we can develop both the vaccine and treatment in the fastest time possible , " Park said at a briefing on Sunday . 
Such cooperation would cut down the time taken for administrative reasons and provide infrastructure or resources needed , Park said . 
Race for a vaccine : This week , a study published in The Lancet medical journal warned that coronavirus lockdowns across the globe should not be completely lifted until a vaccine for the disease is found . 
China 's draconian restrictions on daily life appear to have halted the first wave of Covid 19 across much of the country , but the researchers used mathematical modeling to show that premature lifting of measures could result in a sweeping second wave of infection .
