Former US Vice President Al Gore said that President Donald Trump and his administration have failed to properly handle the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Gore said when he was vice president , he began every day with a report from the intelligence community and : Gore said he believes Trump both missed the warnings and " failed to mobilize the resources of the federal government to straighten out this testing catastrophe , to get swabs , and the so called re agents they need to do the tests , and the gowns , and masks , and all of the other stuff . " 
Reopening too soon : Gore also said he 's concerned the country is not ready to reopen . 
Trump , Gore said , " may be recklessly rolling the dice hoping that he can goose the economy just enough in the third quarter of this year to enhance his reelection prospects , hoping that he can divert the blame for the extra tens of thousands of Americans who the doctors tell us will die as a result of this , and blame it on the Chinese or former President Obama or whoever , instead of doing what a president needs to do . "
