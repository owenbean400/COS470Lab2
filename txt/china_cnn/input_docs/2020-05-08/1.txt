The coronavirus that causes Covid 19 can persist in men ’s semen even after they have begun to recover , a finding that raises the possibility the virus could be sexually transmitted , Chinese researchers said Thursday . 
A team at Shangqiu Municipal Hospital tested 38 male patients treated there at the height of the pandemic in China , in January and February . 
About 16 % of them had evidence of the coronavirus in their semen , the team reported in the journal JAMA Network Open . 
About a quarter of them were in the acute stage of infection and nearly 9 % of them were recovering , the team reported . 
Why this finding is not terribly surprising : Many viruses can live in the male reproductive tract . 
Ebola and Zika virus were both found to spread in semen , sometimes months after a male patient had recovered . 
But it ’s not yet clear if coronavirus can spread this way . 
Finding evidence of virus does not necessarily mean it ’s infectious . 
" If it could be proved that SARS Co V 2 can be transmitted sexually in future studies , sexual transmission might be a critical part of the prevention of transmission , " the team wrote .
