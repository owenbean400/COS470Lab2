Not everyone in China will need to get vaccinated against Covid 19 , according to the country 's top medical official , as Beijing looks to prioritize frontline workers and high risk populations in a move that underscores rising confidence among policy makers of their ability to contain the virus . 
The question of vaccinating the public was one of balancing " risks and benefits , " he added , pointing to factors like cost and potential side effects . 
There is not currently a need for mass vaccination at this stage -- though that could change if another serious outbreak takes place , Gao said . 
The policy marks China apart from many Western governments , most notably Australia , that have outlined plans to introduce mass public vaccination drives . 
Outbreak under control : China 's reported virus numbers have stayed low since the spring . 
There have been a few flare ups -- clusters in the northeastern Jilin province in May , an outbreak in Beijing in June , and another in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in July -- but these were met with immediate lockdown measures and mass testing , and the outbreaks were contained within a few weeks . 
Gao cited these brief outbreaks as evidence of China 's effective containment measures . 
" The facts have proven that we have several magic weapons to respond to the epidemic , " he said , according to China News Service . 
Any potential vaccine would instead be prioritized for those on the front lines , he added : medical workers , Chinese nationals working overseas in virus hostpots , and people working in dense , high risk environments like restaurants , schools or cleaning services .
