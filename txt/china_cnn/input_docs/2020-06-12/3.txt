All viruses mutate — including the novel coronavirus . 
But as the world now races to develop a Covid 19 vaccine , the coronavirus mutations are not expected to alter vaccine efficacy during this race , said World Health Organization chief scientist Dr . Soumya Swaminathan . 
Swaminathan added that " viruses keep on changing and we have to keep an eye on that . " 
Currently there are about 200 vaccine candidates in development around the world , with 10 in human trials — four in the United States , five in China and one in the United Kingdom — and 126 in preclinical trials globally , according to WHO . 
Regarding how the coronavirus may differ across countries due to mutations , " the virus may be slightly different but it ’s not so different that the vaccine will not work , " Swaminathan said . 
" It ’s also good to have vaccine trials in many different countries because you have different populations , different genetics , different risk factors and WHO very much would like to see the candidates that are being developed now being tested in many countries . "
