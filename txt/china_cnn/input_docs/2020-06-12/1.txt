Having a safe and effective Covid 19 vaccine available for the world is currently the " best way " to beat the coronavirus pandemic , according to World Health Organization chief scientist Dr . Soumya Swaminathan . 
" Everyone is waiting for a vaccine because it ’s clear that a vaccine would be the best way out of this pandemic . 
If you can vaccinate enough people — let ’s say 50 % to 60 % of people become immune — the virus can stop spreading from one person to another , " Swaminathan said on Friday during a live Q&A broadcast on WHO 's social media pages . 
Currently , there are about 200 vaccine candidates in development around the world , with 10 in human trials — four in the United States , five in China and one in the United Kingdom — and 126 in preclinical trials globally , according to WHO . 
" The other thing that WHO is working on is developing an allocation framework because we do not want to be in a situation where there are some doses of a vaccine but they ’re not available to everyone , they ’re just available to a few people in a few countries . 
So this is where global solidarity comes in , " Swaminathan said . 
" Our member states are discussing , how do we make a fair and equitable allocation ? 
So that , let ’s say you have 50 million doses to begin with -- who are the people who need it the most ? 
It should not be limited by country but it should be : Is it the most vulnerable ? 
The frontline workers that we see are getting infected ? 
Is it the elderly ? 
The people above 60 or 65 ? 
We need to have a consensus on that . "
