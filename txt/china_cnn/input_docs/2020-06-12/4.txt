The wife of Li Wenliang , the Wuhan whistleblower doctor who died of coronavirus in February , has given birth to their son , according to the Chinese state run Litchi News . 
Li 's wife told Litchi News early Friday morning local time that she gave birth to a baby boy in a Wuhan Hospital . 
Who was Li Wenliang ? 
Li was a doctor in the Chinese city of Wuhan , which was ground zero for the coronavirus pandemic . 
In late December , when reports emerged of a dangerous new virus in the city , he texted fellow medical school alumni warning them of the news . 
" I only wanted to remind my university classmates to be careful , " he told CNN in February . 
Soon after , he was targeted by Wuhan police , who accused him of rumor mongering . 
He was made to sign a statement acknowledging his " misdemeanor " and promising not to commit further " unlawful acts . " 
On February 1 , he tested positive for the virus . 
He died less than a week later -- sparking a rare online wave of grief , fury , calls for freedom of speech and government accountability .
