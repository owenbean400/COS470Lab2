The coronavirus pandemic is far from coming to an end any time soon , according to World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . 
" Although many countries have made some progress globally , the pandemic is actually speeding up . 
We 're all in this together and we 're all in this for the long haul , " Tedros said . 
" We have already lost so much but we cannot lose hope . " 
Tedros also said that Tuesday marks six months since WHO first received reports of cases of pneumonia in China from an unknown cause -- which would later be identified as caused by novel coronavirus infection .
