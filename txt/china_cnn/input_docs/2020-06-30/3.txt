Chinese researchers have discovered a new type of swine flu that can infect humans and has the potential to cause a future pandemic , according to a study released on Monday . 
The disease , which researchers called the G4 virus , is genetically descended from the H1N1 swine flu that caused a global pandemic in 2009 . 
G4 now shows " all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus , " said the study , published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 
The new study comes as the world grapples with the Covid 19 pandemic , which has now infected more than 10.3 million people globally and caused more than 505,000 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
How was it discovered ? 
Researchers detected G4 during a pig surveillance program that ran from 2011 to 2018 , in which they collected more than 30,000 nasal swab samples from pigs in slaughterhouses and veterinary teaching hospitals across 10 Chinese provinces . 
From these samples , researchers identified 179 swine influenza viruses -- but not all of them posed a concern . 
Some only showed up one year out of the program 's seven , or eventually declined to nonthreatening levels . 
But the G4 virus kept showing up in pigs , year after year -- and even showed sharp increases in the swine population after 2016 . 
Can it infect people ? 
Further tests showed that G4 can infect humans by binding to our cells and receptors , and it can replicate quickly inside our airway cells . 
And though G4 holds H1N1 genes , people who have received seasonal flu vaccines wo not have any immunity . 
G4 already appears to have infected people in China . 
In Hebei and Shandong provinces , both places with high pig numbers , more than 10 % of swine workers on pig farms and 4.4 % of the general population tested positive in a survey from 2016 to 2018 .
