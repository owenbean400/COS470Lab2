Authorities in Beijing locked down more residential compounds , had more than 30,000 restaurants disinfected and tightened outbound travel as the Chinese capital 's latest coronavirus outbreak continues to spread , with more than 100 people now infected . 
The Beijing Municipal Health Commission reported 27 fresh Covid 19 cases today -- taking the five day total to 106 following a flare up at Xinfadi , the city 's largest wholesale food market . 
The sprawling , bustling market in Beijing 's southwestern Fengtai district occupies 277 acres and has more than 2,000 stalls , selling mainly fruit and vegetables as well as meat and seafood . 
It supplies about 70 % of the city 's vegetables and 10 % of its pork , according to officials . 
The market has been shut down since Saturday , but its sheer size and the amount of people who work or visit there from in and outside of Beijing have heightened the risk of the outbreak spreading . 
Via door to door visits and calls , authorities have tracked down nearly 200,000 people who had been to the market during the two weeks prior to its closure . 
They have been told to stay at home for medical observation and are being tested for the coronavirus , a city official told a news conference on Monday .
