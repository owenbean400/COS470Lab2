Dr . Anthony Fauci says he hopes many countries around the world are successful in finding a coronavirus vaccine . 
Speaking to NPR ’s 1A program on Tuesday , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said , " I would love there to be more than one , two or three vaccines , including China getting a vaccine , and we get a vaccine , and some of the European countries get a vaccine . " 
Fauci said that for a vaccine to be successful , it has to be available globally . 
" The more companies that have successful vaccines , the better off we are . 
I do not see this as a race in which there is one winner , " Fauci said . 
The United States ’ efforts are " moving very quickly , " he said . 
" And I might emphasize , not at the experience of safety , nor compromising any of the scientific integrity of the study . " 
Fauci said there is no guarantee that a vaccine is going to be effective . 
" Certainly we would not have a vaccine given to anyone if it 's not safe , and if it 's not effective , " he said . 
But Fauci is hoping " to get to the point where you can make a determination if it 's effective likely , by the end of this calendar year and the beginning of 2020 . 
So , the vaccine does show itself to be safe and effective , we may get doses that are available for people by the very end of this year , and the beginning of the first few months of 2021 . "
