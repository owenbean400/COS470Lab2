China begins its most important political event of the year today , following a two month delay due to the novel coronavirus outbreak . 
The National People 's Congress ( NPC ) will give Chinese leaders an opportunity to highlight their success in containing the virus and underscore the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , as it faces a growing international backlash over its initial handling of the crisis . 
The annual gatherings will also reveal Beijing 's plans for how to revive an economy battered by the pandemic , which has led to the country 's first economic contraction after decades of continuous growth . 
A new normal : Like everything else disrupted by the pandemic , this year 's NPC meetings will not be the same as usual . 
Still cautious about a potential second wave of coronavirus infections , the Chinese government is not taking preventive measures lightly . 
At the opening ceremony on Friday morning , all delegates donned face masks , except more than two dozen senior leaders sitting in the front two rows on stage -- including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang . 
The congress will be truncated to just a week -- about half of the usual duration . 
There will also be fewer news conferences , all of which will be held online via videoconferencing . 
Only a select group of reporters will be allowed to cover the opening and closing ceremonies -- after they pass coronavirus tests . 
But even for them , no public interviews will be allowed .
