China will not set a specific target for economic growth this year , said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the 13th National People 's Congress in Beijing . 
The NPC , China 's top legislature , opened its third session on Friday morning . 
Not setting a specific target for economic growth would enable the government to focus more on achieving stability and security , he said . 
Li added that China is expected to face great uncertain economic challenges following the pandemic , and that coronavirus was " the fastest spreading , most extensive , and most challenging public health emergency China has encountered since the founding of the People 's Republic . " 
Some context : The world 's second largest economy has taken a huge hit from the virus , as lockdown measures brought much of the country to a halt from late January to March . 
China 's gross domestic product shrunk 6.8 % in the first quarter this year -- the worst plunge since quarterly records began in 1992 . 
The Chinese Communist Party has pledged to double the size of the economy from 2010 by the end of 2020 -- a goal that could be difficult to reach in the fallout of the pandemic , as growth had already slowed due to a prolonged trade war with the United States .
