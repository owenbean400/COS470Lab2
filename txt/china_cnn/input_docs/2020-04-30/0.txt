China recorded four new cases of novel coronavirus and no new deaths yesterday . 
All four new cases were imported , said the National Health Commission . 
That brings the official national total to 82,862 cases and 4,633 deaths . 
That does not reflect the number of active cases , but rather the total number of infections since the pandemic began ; so far , 77,610 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital . 
Another 33 new asymptomatic cases , which are counted separately , were also reported yesterday . 
Fears of a second wave : The situation in China appears to have calmed down mostly , with local transmissions dropping close to zero and cities slowly reemerging from lockdown . 
The country announced yesterday it will hold it biggest annual political meeting in May following a two month delay -- the strongest signal yet from the government that it considers the coronavirus outbreak to be under control . 
But beneath the surface , fears about a potential second wave of infections remain high . 
As of Wednesday , a total of 1,660 imported cases have been reported , mostly Chinese nationals returning from overseas . 
In many cities , all overseas arrivals are required to go into mandatory quarantine for at least two weeks .
