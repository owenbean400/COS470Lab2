A deep dive into the genetics of the novel coronavirus shows it seems to have spent some time infecting both bats and pangolins before it jumped into humans , researchers said Friday . 
Pangolins , also known as scaly anteaters , are sold as food in China and have been a prime suspect as a possible source of the pandemic . 
Yet the researchers said it ’s too soon to blame pangolins for the pandemic and a third animal species may have played host to the virus before it spilled over to people . 
What is clear is that the coronavirus has swapped genes repeatedly with similar strains infecting bats , pangolins and a possible third species , a team at Duke University , Los Alamos National Laboratory and elsewhere reported in the journal Science Advances . 
What ’s also clear is that people need to reduce contact with wild animals that can transmit new infections , they concluded . 
The team analyzed 43 complete genomes from three strains of coronaviruses that infect bats and pangolins and that resemble the new Covid 19 virus . 
But their findings may let pangolins off the hook .
