Asked about the coronavirus death toll reaching 200,000 in the US today , President Trump said , " Well , I think it ’s a shame . " 
After ignoring a question from CNN 's Nikki Carvajal on his message to the American people , Trump was pressed on passing the 200,000 death threshold , and turned the conversation to his standard response on the virus , blaming China and saying the death count could have been much worse had he not taken action . 
" I think if we did not do it properly and do it right , you ’d have two and a half million deaths . 
If you take a look at alternatives , you could have two and a half million deaths or something thereabouts . 
You could have a number that would be substantially more , " Trump told reporters before departing the White House on Tuesday . 
" And you saw my United Nations speech , China should have stopped it at their border . 
They should have never let this spread all over the world and it ’s a terrible thing . " 
Trump went on to say had he not closed the country down , there could have been upwards of 3 million deaths . 
" It ’s a horrible thing . 
Should have never ever happened . 
China let this happen and just remember that , " Trump added . 
Facts First : It ’s misleading for Trump to say he closed the US border to travel from China and Europe because both policies contained multiple exemptions , including for US citizens and permanent residents ; the Europe policy exempted entire countries . 
Only foreign nationals who had been in China , Europe 's Schengen area , the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the US .
