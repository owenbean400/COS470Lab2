Clara cited Jacobi Medical Center and Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx and Elmhurst Hospital in Queens as the institutions she and her husband thought might need the supplies the most . 
The 2,000 ventilators that were donated are noninvasive , so they are not the type that can be used on patients who are unconscious .
