Dr . Bruce Aylward , team lead for the World Health Organization China joint mission on coronavirus , addressed the possibility that the virus could become a pandemic at a news conference today . 
Aylward and a team of 25 people visited several areas in China , including Wuhan , to see how China was addressing the virus . 
Aylward said China is using basic public health tools and applying them with rigor and innovation on a scale never seen in history . 
" It â€™s the unanimous assessment of the team that they have changed the course of this outbreak . 
What was a rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued and then come down faster than one would have expected , " Aylward said , adding hundreds of thousands of people in China did not get this because of this response . 
What is a pandemic ? 
A disease outbreak is the occurrence of disease cases in excess of what 's normally expected , according to WHO . 
An epidemic is more than a normal number cases of an illness , specific health related behavior or other health related events in a community or region . 
A pandemic is defined as the " worldwide spread " of a new disease . 
The last pandemic reported was the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 , which killed hundreds of thousand worldwide . 
Although WHO has declared the outbreak a " public health emergency of international concern , " the outbreak has not met the criteria needed to be described as a pandemic when it comes to its geographical spread and impact , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during Monday .
