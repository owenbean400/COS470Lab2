The US Food and Drug Administration is currently not able to conduct routine inspections on drugs , medical supplies or household goods from China due the US State Department ’s travel advisory for China over the coronavirus outbreak , the agency said in a statement . 
Inspections are just one tool the FDA uses to make sure products are safe , and the lack of inspections is " not hindering our efforts to monitor medical products and food safety , " officials said . 
The agency monitors products through import screening , sampling and import alerts and it works with US Customs and Border Protection to look for products that violate legal requirements . 
Some 60 % of FDA regulated products imported from China are medical devices , the agency said , and 20 % are housewares , such as food packaging . 
In response to the outbreak , the FDA said it will also use , where appropriate , the agency ’s authority to request records from firms " in advance or in lieu of " drug surveillance inspections in China . 
Paper records will help prioritize what inspections should happen first during what could become a back log in on the ground inspections , depending on how long the travel restrictions continue , the agency said . 
The FDA reiterated that there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through imported goods , but added that this is a " dynamic " situation and the agency will continue to assess it and update guidance as needed . 
The FDA promised it is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate any coronavirus related issues in a collaborative effort with other agencies .
