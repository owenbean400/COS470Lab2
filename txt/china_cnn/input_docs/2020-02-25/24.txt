While the US Food and Drug is not aware of any shortages of medical products being reported in the United States , it is monitoring some that could be at risk , FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn told reporters Tuesday . 
In particular , the FDA is keeping its eye on personal protective equipment such as face masks and gowns used by health care workers . 
The agency is proactively reaching out to hundreds of manufacturers of medical products for information related to these concerns , Hahn said . 
More on this : US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said some of the $ 2.5 billion requested funds would be used to purchase personal protection equipment for the national stockpile . 
On Tuesday morning , Azar told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee there are 30 million N95 respirators in the Strategic National Stockpile , and the US would need about 10 times that for health care workers . 
Hahn also said that the agency is postponing roughly 100 scheduled inspections in China over February and March â€” mostly routine surveillance inspections meant to ensure that medical products produced in China meet the standards for entering the US marketplace . 
But he said these can happen at any time during the year , and the agency is moving things around so they can stay on schedule when it comes to planned inspections for the year .
