No drug manufacturers have reported that they anticipate shortages of particular drugs due to the novel coronavirus , a US Food and Drug Administration spokesperson said on Monday . 
The agency said it has been in touch with 180 drug manufacturers to remind them of their regulatory obligation to notify the FDA if they anticipate any disruption in drugs supplies . 
Reviewing supplies : The FDA asked companies to evaluate their supply chain in light of the novel coronavirus and what potential challenge that may pose to the global drug supply , the statement said . 
Sourcing from China : The FDA says it has identified about 20 drug products that either solely source their active pharmaceutical ingredients or produce finished drug products from or in China . 
Where do our drugs come from ? 
Most active pharmaceutical ingredients -- the drugs that are formulated into capsules , tablets and injections -- are not manufactured in the United States . 
As of August 2019 , 13 % of active pharmaceutical ingredients for the US market are made in China , Dr . Janet Woodcock , the director of FDA â€™s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , said in October . 
The number of firms making those ingredients in China more than doubled between 2010 and 2019 . 
In August 2019 , India made 18 % of these ingredients and the EU made 26 % of these ingredients for the US market .
