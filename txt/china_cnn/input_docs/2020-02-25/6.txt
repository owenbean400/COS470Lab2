Health officials have yet to label the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic -- but they could be close to calling it one . 
Not there yet On Monday , the World Health Organization 's director general Dr . Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said coronavirus has pandemic potential -- but it ’s not there yet . 
Tedros said the decision to use the word pandemic is based on ongoing assessments of the geographic spread of the virus , severity and impact of the society and for the moment they are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus . 
He said the virus is affecting countries across the world in different ways and requires a tailored response , adding it ’s not a one size fits all response . 
Remember : There is no precise , mathematical definition of a pandemic . 
Outbreaks get characterized as pandemics by epidemiologists -- who are not yet using the term . 
That 's because they 've yet to see sustained transmission among people who have not recently traveled to China or had close contact with someone who recently traveled to China . 
It 's not enough for a cluster of disease in a country to exist and even spread -- it has to spread in a sustained way , from person to person , time and time again , through many generations of transmission . 
Right now , certain countries may still be able to contain the clusters of disease they are experiencing , and if they snuff out the outbreaks before they progress and achieve sustained transmission , they will have avoided a pandemic .
