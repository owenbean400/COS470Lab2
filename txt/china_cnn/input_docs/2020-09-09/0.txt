The Trump administration intends to end coronavirus screenings of passengers arriving to the United States from overseas , according to three officials familiar with the plans . 
The US began conducting enhanced screenings of passengers arriving from Wuhan , China , where there had been coronavirus outbreak , at select airports in January . 
Over the following months , additional airports began the process of checking passengers from high risk countries . 
For a brief period , the screenings resulted in long lines and overcrowded conditions at US airports . 
The administration now appears set to end those screenings , a move first reported by Yahoo News . 
US Customs and Border Protection deferred to the Department of Homeland Security , which has not returned request for comment . 
A TSA official told CNN that a draft public affairs guidance memo lays out the rationale for ending airport screening — of the 675,000 passengers screened at 15 airports , fewer than 15 had been identified as having COVID 19 . 
It ’s been difficult to measure how effective the screenings were to begin with . 
Data provided to the House Oversight Committee earlier this year revealed few passengers were stopped in initial screenings of international flights from early coronavirus hotspots outside of China . 
The screenings included questions about medical history , current condition , and contact information for local health authorities .
