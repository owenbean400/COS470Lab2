Pope Francis dedicated Thursday ’s homily to Italian authorities , asking people to support the government during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Authorities often feel " alone " during times like these , but " it ’s for everyone ’s common good , " the Pope said . 
Italy was placed under total lockdown on Monday -- meaning schools are closed , movement restricted , events canceled , public services suspended , and many public spaces are empty as people stay home . 
Italy now has the most coronavirus cases outside of China .
