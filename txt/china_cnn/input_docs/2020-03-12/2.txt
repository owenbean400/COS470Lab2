Mainland China reported 15 new coronavirus cases yesterday -- continuing the week long trend of dramatically falling numbers , according to China 's National Health Commission . 
Six of those cases were imported from overseas -- meaning they were not locally transmitted in China . 
Hubei province , where the coronavirus pandemic began back in December , reported eight new cases -- the lowest to be reported from Hubei since the outbreak began . 
The drop in new daily cases is especially striking given that just a month or two ago , the country was reporting around 2,000 new cases per day . 
China has now reported 80,793 cases and 3,169 deaths . 
Of the total cases , 62,793 have recovered and been discharged from hospital , according to the NHC .
