A woman who traveled from China to Illinois in mid January likely transmitted novel coronavirus to her husband through " prolonged , unprotected contact , " according to research released Thursday . 
None of more than 300 people who came into contact with the two patients after they showed symptoms , however , developed symptoms of their own . 
The findings , published in the medical journal The Lancet , detail the first known transmission of novel coronavirus in the United States , and suggest that the virus may transmit most easily through extended contact with infected people , not brief or casual exposures . 
Dr . Jennifer Layden , the chief medical officer of the Chicago Department of Public Health , who co led the research , stressed that health care providers should still " rapidly triage and isolate individuals suspected of having [ the virus ] " and notify local health departments . 
That 's because , according to the study , " infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response " to these first cases might have prevented widespread coronavirus exposure . 
And it 's possible that other patients — those with more severe illness , for example — may transmit the virus more easily . 
The researchers cautioned that their findings are preliminary and based on a single transmission event , which might not represent the population at large . 
The study had other limitations , too . 
Because they relied on memories to reconstruct people 's movements , investigators might not have identified everybody who came into contact with the coronavirus patients .
