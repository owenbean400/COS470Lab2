Amid a rush of Thanksgiving travel , accelerating infection rates and no significant change in mobility data , " many Americans could take one simple step to protect themselves : Buy a better mask , " Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , wrote in a Wall Street Journal op ed on Sunday . 
" While there are still some shortages of medical masks , health care workers have dedicated supply chains , " Gottlieb wrote . 
" It ’s time to revise the guidance to consumers . " 
N95 masks and their equivalents offer the best protection against the novel coronavirus , Gottlieb said . 
If used properly , they can filter out at least 95 % of infectious particles . 
Equivalents include the KN95 from China and the FFP2 from Europe . 
Surgical masks are the next best option , which could offer protection of about 60 % , Gottlieb said – but quality matters . 
Many masks sold on Amazon say they are for dust and allergens but are not surgical masks . 
Real medical procedure masks are cleared by the FDA and offer one of three levels of protection , with a level 2 or level 3 mask generally being best . 
Finally , cloth masks are the least protective , Gottlieb said . 
If it is the only available option , it should be thick , snug fitting and made of cotton polyester blends , as these will generally offer more protection . 
" But even a very good cloth mask may only be about 30 % protective ; scarf or bandanna , 10 % or less , " Gottlieb wrote . 
While it may be more expensive to buy better quality masks , having a few available for high risk settings can reduce transmission risks , he said . 
The Department of Homeland Security has also published online instructions for disinfecting and reusing N95 masks , which can extend their life . 
" Slowing the current cycle of spread will be difficult , " Gottlieb wrote . 
" But encouraging Americans to wear higher quality masks is a simple step that might make a difference . "
