Shanghai 's biggest international airport momentarily descended into chaos Sunday night , after authorities ordered a mass testing drive in response to a small outbreak of Covid 19 linked to several cargo handlers . 
Since the beginning of November , seven cargo workers and their close contacts at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport have been diagnosed as confirmed coronavirus cases , including two reported on Sunday . 
In a bid to contain the cluster , authorities ordered all cargo staff at the airport to undergo coronavirus tests overnight and set up a temporary testing site on the second floor of a parking garage , according to a statement from the Shanghai government . 
Photos and videos circulating on Chinese social media show hundreds of people packed closely together inside the garage -- the opposite of social distancing -- with a line of people in hazmat suits trying to hold back crowds pushing forward . 
But the chaos appeared to have calmed before midnight , when the airport police posted photos on Weibo showing workers lining up orderly for the tests . 
As of Monday morning , 17,719 samples had been collected . 
Of the 11,544 samples that have been tested , all received negative results , officials said at a news conference . 
While the initial chaos has drawn criticism on Chinese social media , the swift , drastic response over just a few cases highlights the length the Chinese government is willing to go to in order to stamp out any resurgence of the virus .
