When asked about President Trump ’s continued use of the term " Chinese virus " when referring to the novel coronavirus , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies programme , said WHO has been clear since the beginning of the outbreak , " Viruses know no borders and they do not care your ethnicity or the color of your skin or how much money you have in the bank . " 
Trump 's latest use of the phrase happened Wednesday during a White House press briefing on the coronavirus . 
" This is a time for solidarity , this is a time for facts , this is a time to move forward together , " Ryan said , adding , " there is no blame in this . " 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , World Health Organization infectious disease epidemiologist , said we ’ve seen overwhelming international solidarity during this pandemic . 
" We see this through donations – whether it ’s through [ personal protective equipment ] or I ’ve seen children drawing pictures for health care workers – every single one of those acts of kindness is an act of international unity and we ’d like to see more of that , " Van Kerkhove said . 
" These are very tough times . 
And in many countries this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better . 
But this will be temporary , we will get through this and we will get though it together , " Van Kerkhove added .
