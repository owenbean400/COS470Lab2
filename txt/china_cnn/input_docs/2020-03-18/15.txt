Mild , asymptomatic or otherwise unrecognized infections may have driven the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus in the outbreak â€™s earliest days , according to modeling published Monday in the journal Science . 
The research , based on reported cases in China and travel data , estimated that 86 % of coronavirus infections in the country were " undocumented " in the weeks before officials instituted stringent quarantines . 
Undocumented infections , according to the researchers , can go unrecognized because they come with mild or no symptoms , and that " can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur . " 
These undetected cases , which are often less severe , were estimated to be about half as contagious as confirmed cases . 
But because undetected cases were more common , they could have played an outsize role in spreading the virus , the study said . 
About 4 in 5 people confirmed to have coronavirus , for example , were likely infected by people who did not know they had it , according to the modeling . 
The study , they later added , suggests that " a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control [ the virus ] . "
