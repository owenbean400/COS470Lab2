The United States and Canada are preparing to issue a joint statement that could suspend non essential travel between the two countries in the next 24 to 48 hours , a Trump administration official tells CNN . 
The agreement is not yet finalized and officials are still working to define " non essential travel , " but the official stressed that the new restrictions will ensure that business and trade between the two countries can continue . 
Part of the discussions involve what types of vehicles and individuals would still be allowed to travel between the two borders and for what purpose , the official said . 
The restrictions will likely allow for significant flexibility . 
Unlike travel restrictions on Europe and China , this would be a mutual agreement between the two countries . 
When Trump was asked at the coronavirus task force briefing whether he was considering closing the US land borders on Tuesday , he said , " I do not want to say that , but we are discussing things with Canada and we 're discussing things with Mexico , quite honestly , and again , the relationship is outstanding with both , outstanding . 
We just signed our deal , the USMCA , and the relationship is very strong . "
