Government officials across Hubei province , the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak , are desperate to find ways to stop the spread of the infection . 
In Hubei 's Fangxian County , officials are trying a different approach -- paying sick people . 
According to an official Fangxian County notice , anyone who is sick and reports themselves to a hospital can expect to be paid . 
Patients who have a fever and turn themselves in will receive 1,000 yuan ( $ 142 ) . 
But officials and other interested parties are also being offered cash incentives if they catch anyone with a fever . 
For each person with a fever who is reported by an official or citizen , there is a reward of 500 yuan ( $ 71 ) . 
The notice said that the offer is only valid from today until February 18 .
