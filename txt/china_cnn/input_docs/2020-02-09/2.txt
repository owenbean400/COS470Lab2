The global death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus is at least 805 , surpassing the number of fatalities from the deadly 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak . 
When SARS swept across the world , it sparked an international panic and infected more than 8,000 people , killing 774 . 
In comparison , the coronavirus has now infected more than 27,000 people in China 's Hubei province alone -- and over 37,000 globally . 
Like SARS , this latest outbreak is caused by a coronavirus , a family of viruses common to animals that range from the common cold , to more serious diseases , such as Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) . 
Both the SARS and Wuhan outbreaks started in China -- and both are believed to have originated from wild animal markets .
