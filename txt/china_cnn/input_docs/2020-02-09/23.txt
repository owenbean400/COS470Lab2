A group of 34 Brazilian nationals arrived in Brazil ’s western state of Goias on Sunday after being transported on military planes from Wuhan , China , according to Brazil ’s Health Regulatory Agency ANVISA . 
This came after President Jair Bolsonaro expressed reservations in coordinating their return for fear of contamination . 
None of the new arrivals have shown signs of contamination so far , ANVISA reported . 
Brazil ’s government said it has taken strict measures to isolate these repatriated nationals who arrived at Annapolis Air force base in Goias . 
They are expected to be quarantined for 18 days and will be in isolation in a so called " transit " hotel , according to ANVISA . 
Goias Gov . 
Ronaldo Caiado rebutted public criticism that the quarantine measures are draconian . 
" Brazil has created a protocol that has become an example to the rest of the world , " he told a government news agency .
