China â€™s National Health Commission gave the Wuhan coronavirus a temporary name at a news conference on Saturday . 
For weeks , the rapidly spreading virus has only been known by the name of the city where it originated , something which locals in Wuhan have found frustrating and stigmatizing . 
Chinese officials said that the virus would temporarily be named the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia , or NCP . 
There is no news on when an official final title for the virus will be designated .
