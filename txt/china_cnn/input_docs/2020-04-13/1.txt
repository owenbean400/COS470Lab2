China 's National Health Commission announced 108 new cases of the novel coronavirus this morning , the highest number in at least a month . 
The vast majority of the new infections were imported , with 98 of those diagnosed bringing the virus with them from overseas . 
But there were also 10 locally transmitted cases -- seven in the northeastern Heilongjiang province , and three in Guangdong province in the south of the country . 
Despite being the original epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic , China has seen a dramatic reduction in cases over the past month and has recently begun to remove strict lockdown provisions across the country . 
But officials are now concerned about a second wave of infections brought into China from overseas . 
The total number of cases reported officially in the country is now 82,160 , with 3,341 deaths .
