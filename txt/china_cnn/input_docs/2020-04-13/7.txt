Asked Monday whether China should " pay for the damage done " by the novel coronavirus , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo downplayed any immediate punitive action against Beijing and stressed the need for global cooperation to prevent a recurrence of the pandemic . 
He also said " there ’ll be a time for recriminations " in the future . 
He did not specifically say that those recriminations would be aimed at China . 
Pompeo said the administration was focused on " looking forward , " noting " we ’re trying to find our path to making sure that we reduce risk as we move forward in the days and weeks and months ahead . " 
" For the moment , I think it ’s absolutely essential that we focus on the task ahead of us , getting systems in place such that we can reopen the American economy , and ultimately the global economy as well . 
There ’ll be a time for recriminations , " he said . 
Pompeo said there needed to be " more than a global debate " about whether the Chinese government should be held accountable for the pandemic . 
" It ’s important to understand how this began , where this began , where it originated , and that ’s science , " he said . 
" We ’ve seen these stories about Chinese wet markets , we ’ve seen stories about precisely where this virus originated , and it ’s important that the whole world gets this . "
