A Chinese naval flotilla headed into the Pacific over the weekend , evidence that the People ’s Liberation Army Navy has done a much better job controlling coronavirus than the US Navy , according to a story posted on the PLA ’s English language website . 
The aircraft carrier Liaoning led the group , which included two guided missile destroyers , two guided missile frigates and an auxiliary ship , according to the report from state run tabloid Global Times . 
It cited Japanese and Taiwanese reports and noted the PLA had not confirmed the operation . 
The report said that the Chinese carrier was carrying out this operation while four US Navy aircraft carriers -- the USS Theodore Roosevelt , the USS Ronald Reagan , the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Nimitz -- have reported cases of coronavirus , crimping their operations . 
The Roosevelt , now docked in Guam , has been hit the hardest by the virus , with 585 cases among its crew of more than 4,000 people . 
Almost all of them have been moved ashore on the island and work is going on to disinfect the ship , delaying its ability to deploy . 
The PLA Navy has no such issues , Chinese military experts told the Global Times .
