A study by the Italian Health Institute ( ISS ) analyzed the characteristics of the evolution of the Covid 19 infection in Italy and concluded it bore similarities to what happened in Wuhan , China . 
The report says the Italian cluster " showed worse clinical outcomes " in elderly males with previous health conditions , resembling the most at risk patients in Wuhan . 
According to the institute , the initial reproduction number or R0 — the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person — was 2.96 in the region of Lombardy , one of the most affected . 
The study says that by mid February , the R0 had edged up slightly to three . 
Silvio Brusaferro , head of the ISS had said during his weekly briefing that R0 levels should ideally be below one to flatten the Covid 19 curve . 
" Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia , explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread observed . 
Overall Rt [ the virus ' transmission rate at a given time ] in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country , supporting the importance of combined non pharmacological control measures , " the report says .
