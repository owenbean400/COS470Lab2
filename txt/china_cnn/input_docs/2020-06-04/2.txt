Pakistan now has 85,264 confirmed cases of Covid 19 , authorities said , becoming the latest country to overtake the total in China , where the pandemic began . 
At least 1,770 virus related deaths have also been recorded in Pakistan . 
The country lifted its nationwide lockdown in early May , though the rate of new infections continues to rise . 
That could be in part due to an increase in testing by the government , especially within the last 24 hours . 
Prime Minister Imran Khan announced earlier this week that his government is working on measures to reopen domestic tourism . 
For now , hotels and restaurants remain closed . 
China has reported 84,160 coronavirus cases and 4,638 deaths .
