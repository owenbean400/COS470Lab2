An annual vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre will not take place in Hong Kong today , after police refused organizers permission to hold a mass gathering during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Every year on June 4 , thousands have gathered at a candlelit rally in Hong Kong to mark the anniversary -- the only mass memorial held on Chinese soil and a key emblem of the semi autonomous city 's political freedoms . 
The massacre made headlines around the world -- with iconic images such as the " Tank Man " defying troops -- but it particularly resonated in Hong Kong , which was then eight years away from being handed over from British to Chinese control . 
No official death toll has ever been released , but rights groups estimate hundreds , if not thousands , were killed . 
Yet Hong Kong police would not give permission for this year 's rally to go ahead , citing coronavirus restrictions . 
For many in the democratic opposition , however , the justification rings hollow : organizers had said they would work with the authorities to ensure a safe and socially distanced rally , and meanwhile the city 's shopping districts , subway and public parks have been open for weeks with little issue . 
The decision by police carries extra weight as many already feared this week might be the last opportunity to freely mark the anniversary . 
Last month , China announced it would impose a national security law on Hong Kong , in response to widespread and often violent anti government unrest last year .
