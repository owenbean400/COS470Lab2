People with the novel coronavirus may have the same viral load — or amount of virus in the body — whether or not they are showing symptoms of illness , according to researchers in China . 
The letter from the researchers , which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine , details how the researchers monitored viral loads of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from the nose and throat of 18 patients : nine men and nine women ranging in age from 26 to 76 in Zhuhai , in China ’s Guangdong province . 
For those samples , a total of 72 nasal swabs and 72 throat swabs were collected and analyzed . 
The analysis revealed that higher viral loads were detected soon after a person was showing symptoms , with higher viral loads found in the nose than in the throat . 
Among the patients , only one was asymptomatic . 
Yet overall , " the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients , which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients , " the researchers wrote in the letter . 
It also turned out that , when it comes to viral shedding , the novel coronavirus seemed to resemble influenza more than SARS , according to the letter . 
How many affected : Globally , the World Health Organization has reported that there have been more than 75,000 laboratory or clinically confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and more than 2,000 deaths .
