White House trade adviser Peter Navarro defended President Trump 's handling of the coronavirus pandemic amid revelations from journalist Bob Woodward 's upcoming book detailing the President 's efforts to downplay the virus in its early stages . 
When asked about the audio tape of Trump 's comment in early February to Woodward about the virus being more deadly than the flu , yet denying this two weeks later in a White House briefing , Navarro hailed the President for halting travel to the US from China in what he called " a signal " from Trump that " this is a serious , serious matter . " 
Navarro had privately warned White House officials early about the seriousness of the virus . 
He pointed to a memo he said he wrote on Feb . 9 saying , among other things , that the US could have a vaccine by the end of the year " if we start right now . " 
He said he wrote this " under the advice of the President in terms of getting on this situation because it might be serious . " 
Navarro claimed that in the early days of the pandemic , the US was in the " fog of war " and alleged there were " competing views as to whether this is simply the flue or whether this is very serious " at the time , despite the President 's own comments , which were recorded on tape by Woodward .
