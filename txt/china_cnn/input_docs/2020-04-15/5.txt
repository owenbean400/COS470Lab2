US President Donald Trump stunned world leaders and health experts on Tuesday when he announced he was halting funding to the World Health Organization , in the middle of the global coronavirus pandemic . 
He first threatened to do so last week , accusing the WHO of mismanaging the spread of the novel coronavirus , and of not acting quickly enough to investigate the virus when it first emerged in China in December 2019 . 
Antonio Guterres , Secretary General of the United Nations , which is the WHO 's parent organization , described the pandemic as unprecedented in a statement on Tuesday , and acknowledged that there would be " lessons learned " for future outbreaks . 
" Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic , there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe , and how all those involved reacted to the crisis , " he said in the statement .
