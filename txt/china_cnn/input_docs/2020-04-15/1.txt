US President Donald Trump 's trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared on Fox News after the White House briefing to defend the President ’s WHO funding halt and discuss how it could impact US China relations . 
Pressed on how this could impact future trade negotiations with China , he called those " interesting questions " but went on to talk about supply chains . 
Asked again later in the interview how coronavirus will impact the US China relationship , Navarro said , " We have to find out where it originated . 
We have to understand why China did not tell us for six weeks in which we lost precious time preparing for a pandemic . " 
" This is something we will not forget : China was basically vacuuming up the world ’s PPE around the world so that we did not have it in New York and people did not have it in Milan , " he said . 
" That ’s a question that has to be answered . 
The question going forward is will they provide the PPE to the world as we go through this crisis without strings ? "
