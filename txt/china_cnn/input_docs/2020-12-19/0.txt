Essential workers will be the first to be immunized against Covid 19 when a vaccine roll out begins in China , a spokesman for the State Council Information Office said in a news conference Saturday . 
According to the spokesman , those key populations include : Cold chain logistics workers Customs border inspection workers Medical disease control workers Farmers market/seafood market workers Public transportation workers Students traveling to medium and high risk countries The second step will be to roll out immunization to the larger population when vaccine output increases , officials added . 
Vaccine trials : China currently has five coronavirus vaccine candidates from four companies that have reached phase 3 clinical trials , the last and most important step of testing before regulatory approval is sought . 
Having largely eliminated the coronavirus inside its borders , Chinese drugmakers had to look abroad for places to test their vaccines ' efficacy . 
Together , they have rolled out phase 3 trials in at least 16 countries .
