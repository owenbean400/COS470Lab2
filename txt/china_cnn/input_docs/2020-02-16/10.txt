Sitting alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People , World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was effusive in his praise of the country 's response to the coronavirus crisis . 
" We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak , especially the commitment from top leadership , and the transparency they have demonstrated , " Tedros said , in comments that would be repeatedly quoted in China 's state media for weeks .
