Virginia does not have enough personal protective equipment ( PPE ) or testing material to keep up with demand , Gov . 
Ralph Northam said during a news conference Friday . 
A disruption in the supply chain in China coupled with the increased demand have resulted in a global shortage , Northam said . 
Some context : Virginia is competing with their own health care system , as well as other states and the federal government for more PPE , Northam said . 
Northam said they need a national solution and hope that manufacturers in the US can produce more equipment .
