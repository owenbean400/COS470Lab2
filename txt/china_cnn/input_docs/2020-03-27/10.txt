There are now 25 sailors who have tested positive for the coronavirus aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , just two days after the Pentagon announced that three sailors aboard the ship had tested positive for the virus , a Navy official has confirmed to CNN . 
The Navy says they expect there to be additional positive tests among the crew , with one official telling CNN there could possibly be " dozens " of new cases that emerge . 
A second official said that were there to be a large number of additional cases , the Defense Department would be unlikely to publicly specify how many of the Navy 's overall cases are amongst members of the crew of the Roosevelt , due to concerns that adversaries such as China or North Korea could see the ship as vulnerable . 
Despite the outbreak , Chief of Naval Operations Adm . Mike Gilday said in a statement , " we are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region . " 
Earlier in the day , acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had said there were " several " more cases onboard the ship , but did not give a specific number . 
" We are in the process now of testing 100 % of the crew of that ship to ensure that we 're able to contain whatever spread might 've occurred , " Modly told reporters at the Pentagon at a briefing Thursday morning . 
There are approximately 5,000 personnel on board the carrier .
