CNN 's global town hall on the coronavirus town hall has just ended for the night . 
We talked about the situation in China , Europe , and the US , answered questions from our audiences , and had special guests like Bill Gates and Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky . 
Here are some of the takeaways : This is not over yet : The US has not yet peaked , and we wo not be able to return to normal life by April , said Bill Gates and top US infectious diseases expert Dr . Anthony Fauci . 
We need more testing : There is still a lot we do not know about the disease and how long it will last -- but ratcheting up testing and collecting more data will give us a better idea in the coming weeks and months . 
Stay vigilant : We all still need to be continuing preventative measures like thoroughly washing our hands , social distancing , and home isolation . 
But also take care of yourself : Mental health is especially important in times like these , and there are resources in your community or through remote means that can help combat feelings of helplessness , anxiety , and depression . 
We will recover : The economy is taking a hit , and the nation is facing extraordinary circumstances . 
But because the economy is on artificial pause , it will likely recover faster than previous recessions , according to CNN anchor and business editor Richard Quest , and the country will be able to go back to normal once we manage to contain the crisis .
