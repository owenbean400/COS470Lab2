Chinese diplomats have condemned another European media outlet for its handling of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak . 
In a statement over the weekend , the Chinese Embassy in Germany criticized Der Spiegel over its Saturday front page " Coronavirus : Made in China . " 
The headline was accompanied by a photo of a man in a red poncho with a gas mask on . 
" Releasing such a picture does nothing to the outbreak , but only causes panic , mutual blaming and even ( racial ) discrimination . 
We despise such a move , " the embassy said , according to state media . 
This row comes after Chinese officials in Denmark slammed newspaper Jyllands Posten for a cartoon riffing on China 's national flag , with coronavirus modules in place of stars . 
In a statement published online , an embassy spokesperson said the drawing was " an insult to China and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people . " 
Jyllands Posten editor Jacob Nybroe said in an article following the complaint : " We ca not apologize for something we do not think is wrong . 
We have no intention of demeaning or mocking , nor do we think the drawing does ... 
As far as I can see , there are two different forms of cultural understanding here . "
