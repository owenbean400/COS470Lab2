The Chinese government on Monday declined to comment on the delay of the second US evacuation flight to the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak , after slamming Washington ’s response to the epidemic as an overreaction that fanned global hysteria . 
When asked by CNN if the delay of the charter ’s arrival in Wuhan is related to Beijing ’s displeasure over the US response , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said : " The US was the first to evacuate its consulate staff in Wuhan via charter flight . 
Relevant arrangements must be coordinated based on a variety of factors including Wuhan airport capacity to receive supplies . " 
Hua confirmed that China has said it welcomes the US to join the World Health Organization ( WHO ) expert team on the outbreak and the US has submitted a list of names to the WHO . 
Last Wednesday a chartered plane carrying some 200 US citizens -- including about three dozen diplomats and their families -- arrived at March Air Reserve Base in Southern California .
