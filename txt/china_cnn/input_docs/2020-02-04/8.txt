A " large number " of hospital staff in Hong Kong are absent today due to a labor union strike , said the city 's Hospital Authority . 
Why they 're striking : The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance , a medical workers ' union with over 13,000 members , began striking on Monday to demand the government completely close all borders with China . 
As the group and the authorities failed to reach a compromise , the group kicked off the second stage of strike on Tuesday to further limit services . 
The move comes as Hong Kong announced the death of a 39 year old man from the Wuhan coronavirus on Tuesday . 
The man had previously visited Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak . 
To date , Hong Kong has recorded a total of 15 confirmed coronavirus cases . 
What this means : Emergency services in public hospitals have been " affected to a certain extent " by the strike , said the Hospital Authority . 
Public hospitals now only have " limited number of staff on duty " to provide emergency services , while specialist outpatient clinics can only provide " limited services . " 
The authorities advised patients to reschedule appointments . 
Government response : Chief Executive Carrie Lam criticized the strike , saying critical patients like cancer patients still needed their services . 
Now , medical staff who are still working will have heavier workloads because of the strike , she said . 
The government has already imposed several travel restrictions and closed many borders with the mainland ; only three crossing points , including the city 's international airport , remain open . 
Closing all borders would also mean shutting out Hong Kong residents traveling in the mainland , who would be stranded and unable to return home , Lam said .
