There 's still a lot we do not know about the Wuhan coronavirus , and scientists around the world are racing to gather data and develop a treatment . 
New drug combinations : Officials in Thailand said Monday that a second patient has been treated with a new combination of HIV and flu drugs , after doctors said the cocktail had been successful in treating a 71 year old woman from China with the virus . 
Officials have yet to provide an update on the success of the treatment for the second patient . 
Thailand 's Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters that the 71 year old had the most severe symptoms of all those in care in the country . 
While he cautioned against placing too much expectation on a tiny number of cases , Anutin said he hoped " other academic , medical or research institutions can take this treatment result and find more facts as much as they can do . " 
Experimental medication : Gilead Sciences , a biopharmaceutical firm with an experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir that is used to treat the Ebola virus , said late Friday it is working with Chinese health authorities to see if the medication can combat the symptoms of coronavirus . 
The company said in a statement that remdesivir has demonstrated some success in treating Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) -- two viruses similar to the Wuhan coronavirus -- in animals . 
Treatment centers : A purpose built hospital dedicated to treating the virus also opened in Wuhan Monday . 
The institution was constructed in under a week , and a second is due to open Thursday . 
Both will only handle coronavirus patients , helping to take the pressure off the severely stretched Wuhan healthcare system .
