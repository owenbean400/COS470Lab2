Taiwan announced today that the island will deny entry to foreign nationals who have been to China , starting this Friday .

The restrictions mean that any foreign national who has visited or lived in the People â€™s Republic of China in the past 14 days will be banned from entering Taiwan . 
Those needing to enter for " special reasons " can fill out a visa as long as they have not been to areas " severely affected " by the virus and can submit travel history reports along with medical reports . 
Foreign nationals with a Taiwan resident certificate who have been in China in the past 14 days are required to self isolate in their homes and monitor their health . 
Taiwan has 10 confirmed cases of the coronavirus .
