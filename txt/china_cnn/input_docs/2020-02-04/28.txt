The death rate from the Wuhan coronavirus across mainland China stands at 2.1 % , China â€™s National Health Commission said in a press update on Tuesday . 
In Hubei province , the epicenter of the outbreak , the rate is 3.1 % , said Jiao Yahui , deputy director of the National Health Commissions State Health Administration . 
Hubei province accounts for 97 % of all deaths . 
Of the 425 confirmed deaths across mainland China , 80 % of the victims were over the age of 60 , and 75 % of victims had some form of underlying disease , Jiao added . 
Two thirds of the confirmed deaths are male . 
Jiao attributed the higher number of deaths in Hubei province to the large number of severe cases as well as the initial lack of hospital beds to treat patients . 
Despite the youngest confirmed case being just one month old , the majority of cases -- especially severe cases -- involve elderly patients , Jiao said . 
The national average time needed for a patient to fully recover is nine days , according to Jiao . 
She added that in Hubei province the recovery time is higher at 20 days because there are more severe cases . 
There are currently 20,438 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus across mainland China .
