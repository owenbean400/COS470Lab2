One of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro ’s son set off a war of words Thursday , after calling the Chinese government a " dictatorship " that purposely hid the severity of coronavirus . 
Eduardo Bolsonaro , a congressional lawmaker for the state of Sao Paulo , wrote on Twitter : " Once again , a dictatorship chose to hide something serious instead of exposing the reality , which could have saved countless lives . 
China is to blame and freedom is the solution . " 
The Chinese embassy in Brazil responded to Eduardo Bolsonaro via Twitter Wednesday , saying his comments " sounded familiar " and were " extremely irresponsible . " 
President Bolsonaro and Eduardo Bolsonaro were both part of a delegation that visited US President Trump in Mar a Lago almost two weeks ago . China is Brazil ’s biggest trading partner , but Bolsonaro has made it clear that he considers Trump his main international ally .
