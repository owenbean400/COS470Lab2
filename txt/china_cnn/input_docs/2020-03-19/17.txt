The Chinese government on Thursday announced the result of its investigation into issues related to Dr . Li Wenliang , the ophthalmologist who was reprimanded by police in Wuhan for trying to warn others about the coronavirus â€” and whose death from the virus on Feb . 7 sparked nationwide outrage . 
The national authorities confirmed that the 34 year old Li , who worked at a hospital in Wuhan , re posted internal government documents on the emerging outbreak on Dec . 30 in a social media group chat and warned others not to go outside . 
Local police in Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , subsequently summoned Li on Jan . 3 and issued him a formal reprimand . 
The government investigators also said that Li received proper treatment once he became ill , and all medical procedures were approved by him or his family . 
The authorities concluded that local police 's reprimand of Li was " inappropriate " based on improper application of law and that it should be rectified . 
The government investigators urged local police to withdraw its reprimand and hold relevant personnel accountable .
