China has reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the first time since the the pandemic began , marking a major turning point in the global battle to contain Covid 19 . 
At a news conference on Thursday morning , officials from China 's National Health Commission announced there had been just 34 new cases in the past 24 hours -- all imported from overseas -- and eight new deaths , all in Hubei , the province where the virus was first identified . 
Why this matters : The milestone will likely be held up as proof of the ongoing success of China 's sweeping , top down efforts to control the virus , despite persistent allegations that local officials mishandled the initial outbreak . 
Just last month , mainland China was reporting thousands of new cases every day , and was considered the most high risk infection area in the world . 
In the weeks following the early spread of the virus , the government enacted draconian quarantine measures and strict travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens . 
In some hard hit cities , residents have been unable to leave their apartments for more than a month , while transport between major population hubs has been limited or halted altogether . 
The unprecedented nature of the measures has exacted a steep toll , both on the many millions of ordinary Chinese forced to endure life under lockdown and the country 's economy , which has seen a steep decline in recent weeks .
