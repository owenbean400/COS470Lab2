US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar spoke about what Taiwan , the country he is currently visiting , has done in order to control the Covid 19 pandemic . 
" Taiwan has taken very effective measures , but they ’re very strong measures , " Azar said on ABC ’s Good Morning America on Tuesday . 
Every person who comes into Taiwan is subject to a mandatory quarantine period , where individual compliance is checked and inspected by the police , Azar said . 
Taiwan has also used social media and mandatory cell phone GPS tracking to identify contacts . 
More than 200,000 individuals have been placed in mandatory police enforced quarantine in Taiwan , Azar said . 
" There obviously are contexts here that fit cultural , social and legal norms that may or may not be applicable in the United States , " he said , " but the important thing is that Taiwan has approached this in a transparent , open collaborative way in the international system . " 
They should be highlighted for what they have done for global public health , Azar said , before comparing the country to China . 
" Across the straits of Taiwan , China , the People ’s Republic of China , has not been transparent , have not been collaborative , and have been at the center of creating this global Covid 19 crisis , " he said .
