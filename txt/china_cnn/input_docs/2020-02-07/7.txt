The death of Chinese whistleblower Li Wenliang after he became infected with the novel coronavirus has sparked an unprecedented outpouring of grief and anger toward the government in China . 
On social media , mourners have posted portraits and artwork of Li , vowing not to forget him . 
But one of the reasons his death was met with such deep emotion from the public was because he was just an ordinary person they could relate to . 
He had not set out to be a hero from the beginning -- he was simply trying to protect his friends . 
He first warned about the disease in a group chat with fellow medical school classmates and alumni -- messages that were screen captured and then went viral . 
Li had not wanted to become a public figure -- he was first interviewed anonymously by the China Youth Daily newspaper , and initially refused to speak with foreign media . 
But as the outbreak spread and its severity became clear , he spoke more publicly , eventually posting about his experience on social media . 
A relatable figure : On Weibo , China 's Twitter like platform , Li posted trivial things about himself . 
He was a foodie who sometimes craved ice cream and fried chicken . 
He was a fanboy of certain celebrities , watched popular TV series , and sometimes complained about work , as you do on social media . 
In other words , he was an ordinary , relatable figure . 
People who flocked to his social media profile resonated with him and his tragedy , and came away with the sense : He 's one of us .
