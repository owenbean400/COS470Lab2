Public anger in China is rising over hospitals struggling to find enough supplies , despite the Red Cross -- and other organizations -- having received millions of dollars in donations . 
The Red Cross is the country 's biggest charity -- but , unlike in most other countries , the Red Cross in China is government controlled and receives most of its funding from the state . 
Supply shortage : On February 1 , a government official said that the public had donated more than $ 86 million , and medical supplies to the Wuhan Red Cross , according to the state run China Daily newspaper . 
Despite the donations , doctors and hospital workers describe a desperate situation . 
One doctor in Huanggang , Hubei province , told CNN that his hospital has no usable hazmat suits , face masks or shoe covers . 
And in a video shared by the state run tabloid Global Times last weekend , a doctor says he waited for over an hour at a Red Cross distribution center , just to get a box of 500 masks . 
Official response : In response to anger and accusations , the Hubei Red Cross apologized for its failures and punished three officials for " mishandling donations for the coronavirus . " 
The Wuhan government dismissed one government official , and warned another two over taking masks from a Red Cross warehouse . 
But this is not the first time China 's Red Cross has come under fire during a national crisis , and this time it could be damning -- not only for the organization but also for the government .
