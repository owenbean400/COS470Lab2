Shelves are empty in some Hong Kong supermarkets . 
Toilet rolls , tissue paper , bleach , and even soap have sold out . 
Videos on social media show crowds packed inside supermarkets , rushing to snatch remaining supplies . 
The panic buying began earlier this week and has continued through today , sparked by rumors online that mainland China would stop exporting these goods -- specifically toilet paper -- to Hong Kong , as more borders between the two places close . 
The Hong Kong government has denied the rumors and appealed for calm . 
Emergency measures , including closing several borders , " will not affect the freight services between the Mainland and Hong Kong , " the government said in a statement . 
But the warnings do not seem to have had much effect -- one supermarket 's online shopping site is so swamped that users have to join an online queue , with a wait stretching for more than an hour .
