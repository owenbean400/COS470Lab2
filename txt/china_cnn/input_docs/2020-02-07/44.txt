About one in six people under investigation for Wuhan coronavirus in the United States have had " close contact " with someone confirmed to have been infected , according to a report released today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
About 11 % had contact with another person under investigation had not yet been confirmed to have the virus . 
The majority , about 70 % , had only travel related risk . 
Of them , most had traveled to Wuhan , versus other parts of China . 
The numbers come from 210 people who were under investigation from Jan . 21 to Jan . 31 , when CDC updated its guidelines . 
All of the people were symptomatic — typically with fever and respiratory symptoms — and thus tested for the virus . 
Here are some more numbers from the report : Only six people were identified through airport screenings , and 85 % were identified in health care settings such as hospital emergency departments . 
Another 26 , or 12 % , came from contact tracing . 
The median age was 29 , and 55 % were men . 
People under investigation have included 17 health care workers and at least 48 college students . 
Most people under investigation have been found to not have the virus . 
During the period of the new report , only 11 had tested positive . 
The CDC says these numbers are likely to change . 
" Because person to person transmission is expected to continue , and as further travel restrictions are implemented , it is likely that the proportion of [ people under investigation ] with such contact risk in the United States will increase , " the report says . 
On Friday , the CDC posted its latest total of people under investigation since January 21 : A total of 337 people in 36 states . 
This includes 12 who have tested positive , 225 negative and 100 are still pending .
