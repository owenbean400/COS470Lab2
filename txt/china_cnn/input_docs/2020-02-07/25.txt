For decades , China 's government has based its legitimacy on its ability to grow the economy , keeping its people safe and successful . 
The Wuhan conronavirus threatens this social contract in two ways : the utter failure to contain the outbreak has put hundreds of millions at risk , while the already struggling economy suffers another blow . 
Censors crack down : The public has been angry for weeks that Wuhan officials downplayed the virus and silenced whistleblowers like Li . 
But the central authorities were largely able to keep this anger focused on local officials by allowing a rare amount of transparency and giving Chinese media a relatively free hand . 
In the past week or so , however , the central authorities have tightened their grip on the flow of information , with state media emphasizing positive stories of resilience and heroism . 
What Li 's death means for China : Li might have fit into this new narrative of heroism . 
But his death has instead exposed the cold reality at the heart of the Chinese social contract : when it comes down to it , individuals are absolutely expendable if the stability of the Party is at stake . 
The need to maintain stability is what will dominate the response to Li 's death . 
An outpouring of grief is fine , even some anger is acceptable , provided it can be focused on individuals and not the system at large , and some scalps may be offered to help this along . 
What the authorities cannot allow is for the Party or the central government to become a target -- but whether they will be successful in doing so remains to be seen . 
A relatable figure : Li resonated with the public because he was not some Party cadre or police officer -- he was just an ordinary person who loved ice cream and TV . 
And he 's infinitely more sympathetic than the steely eyed men and women trying to control the narrative around his death .
