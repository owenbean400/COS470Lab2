Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong have been on strike for five days , demanding the government close all borders with mainland China and take further emergency measures against the virus . 
Now , they are voting on whether to continue the strike -- an issue that has become bitter and divisive in the city , where political hostilities have yet to cool after months of ongoing unrest that began in June last year . 
The vote : The strikers are largely members of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance ( HAEA ) , a medical workers ' union . 
The union said earlier today that it will hold a vote on whether to extend or end the strike , and continue striking if more than 6,000 members vote in favor of it . 
The vote is now underway . 
The strike , and the controversy : Yesterday , more than 6,400 union members went on strike , said the HAEA -- about 17 % of the total nursing staff in the Hospital Authority . 
The strike has been criticized by the Hospital Authority , the city 's Chief Executive Carrie Lam , and some members of the public who accuse the strikers of neglecting their duty to patients . 
For most of the week , public hospitals have had limited services due to the strike . 
Remaining staff members have had to focus efforts on emergency services , so patients with mild conditions were advised to find private hospitals or clinics instead . 
Meanwhile , Lam has implemented emergency measures such as mandatory quarantines for travelers coming from China , and closed all but three of Hong Kong 's mainland China border crossings .
