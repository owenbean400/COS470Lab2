China 's ambassador to the United States said he was " really saddened " by the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang , who has died from the coronavirus . 
" He was a very devoted doctor , " tweeted ambassador Cui Tiankai today . 
" We are so grateful to him for what he has done in our joint efforts fighting against ( the coronavirus ) . " 
Cui is one of the few Chinese officials to comment on Li 's death beyond brief statements of condolences -- but his emphasis on " joint efforts " echo other officials and state media , who in recent days have praised the country 's response and pushed positive stories of resilience . 
The statements typically leave out the fact that Li had been targeted by police in December after trying to warn his friends about the virus , and was forced to sign a statement about his " misdemeanor . "
