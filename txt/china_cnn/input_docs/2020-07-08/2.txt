President Donald Trump ’s move to formally withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) is " really sad , " according to WHO Special Envoy on Covid 19 Dr . David Nabarro . 
Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday , Nabarro voiced his sadness at the President ’s decision to pull funding in the midst of " a massive health crisis . " 
Nabarro , who is one of six special envoys on Covid 19 , said he feared that the global health crisis was " going to get much worse in the next six months , " and that there was still a lot to be discovered about the virus . 
Nabarro said that WHO was " underfunded " and " working flat out " during the pandemic . 
He added that he was sure that the American people " by and large want to be part of the global response and will be a bit confused about why this has happened . " 
Nabarro stressed the need for international cooperation , saying that " all world leaders and all world nations must work together to deal with this virus . " 
The US pulling out " is just not frankly what the world 's people need , " he said . 
German Health Minister Jens Spahn made a similar point , describing the official announcement of the US ' withdrawal from WHO -- which goes into effect in July next year -- as a " bitter setback for international cooperation . " 
" We need more international cooperation to fight pandemics , not less . 
Global infection dynamics show that coordinated action is required , " he tweeted Wednesday . 
" European states will initiate WHO reforms . " 
Some context : Trump said he was halting funding to the organization in mid April and announced his intention to withdraw from the WHO in May , after he said it " failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms . " 
Trump had denounced the US ' contribution to WHO -- $ 400-500 million -- in comparison to China 's and consistently accused the organization of aiding China in allegedly covering up the origins of the virus and allowing its spread .
