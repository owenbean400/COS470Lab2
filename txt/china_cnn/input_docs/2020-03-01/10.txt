The director of the religious group at the center of South Korea 's coronavirus outbreak has denied responsibility for the recent spike in infections , saying authorities were trying to " exaggerate " its involvement to shift blame . 
Kim Shin chang , director of international missions for the Shincheonji religious group , told CNN today that members had been fully transparent and cooperative with authorities in trying to contain the outbreak . 
Spike in South Korea : The coronavirus has infected 3,526 people and killed 17 in South Korea . 
Health authorities say nearly 60 % of all cases are related to Shincheonji -- an offshoot of Christianity -- and a specific branch in the southern city of Daegu . 
Accusations of Wuhan travel : South Korea 's Ministry of Justice last week said that 42 Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan , the Chinese city where the coronavirus originated , to South Korea since July . 
This is a big accusation -- the outbreak in Wuhan is so severe that people traveling through it could potentially pick up the virus and bring it to other countries . 
Kim told CNN there were 357 Shincheonji members based in Wuhan , adding that " we have no record " of any coming from Wuhan into South Korea since November . 
" Move the responsibility " : Kim also pointed out the outbreak began in December -- so there was no need to check members ' travel history from July . 
The Ministry of Justice said it had pulled the immigration records from July on request of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) . 
CNN has reached out to KCDC for comment .
