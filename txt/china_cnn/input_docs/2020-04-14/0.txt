During Monday 's task force briefing , the White House presented a digital montage of TV and radio clips of President Trump ’s early actions with the coronavirus . 
One clip featured audio from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman , who can be heard describing how the President was criticized for his early travel ban from China . 
Facts First : The Haberman quotes are misleading as they edit out one of her key points : that the President ’s travel restriction was one of the last actions he took to address the coronavirus for weeks . 
Here ’s the Haberman quote as it was presented by the White House video : According to a transcript of The Daily podcast from March 25 , here ’s the end of the quote , including a key point at the end that was left out of the White House presentation : " At the end of the day , it was probably effective , because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus . 
The problem is , it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks . " 
According to the transcript , the Daily ’s host Michael Barbaro asks a follow up question : " So the right decision in retrospect , but not accompanied by similar actions that might have contained transmission . " 
Haberman responded : " That ’s exactly right . 
In the same way that George W . Bush was criticized for his " Mission Accomplished " banner about Iraq , the president treated that moment as if it was his mission accomplished moment . 
He did not do anything after that in terms of alerting the public , or telling people to be safe , or telling people to take precautions . 
And it basically squandered several weeks within the US . " 
As Haberman pointed out on Twitter , she went on to say that the President " treated that travel limitation as a Mission Accomplished moment , " harkening back to former President George W . Bush .
