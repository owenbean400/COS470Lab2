President Trump lashed out at Dr . Anthony Fauci , claimed " some people do not like ( masks ) scientifically , " and said he would not do much differently in his response to Covid 19 in clips of a Rose Garden town hall with Sinclair released Tuesday evening . 
Asked about his recent comments attacking Fauci , the director of the National Institutes of Health , Trump said he gets along " fine " with the doctor , " but he ’s made mistakes . " 
" He said ‘ No masks , do not wear masks , ’ and then he said ‘ Wear a mask . ’ 
He did not want me to stop people coming in from China and then he admitted it was a great move , that I made , against him . 
You know , I overrode him , " Trump claimed to the conservative outlet . 
" With all of that I get along with him nice – I like him , he ’s – Tony , he ’s a nice guy . " 
" He ’s made bad moves , " he added , " but he ’s been there a long time . " 
Trump also claimed to have " no problem " with masks , despite frequently and repeatedly attacking people who wear them , but immediately added that " some people " do not like them . 
" Frankly some people do not like it , some people do not like it scientifically , " he claimed . 
Science overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that masks work . 
When host Eric Bolling , a vocal Trump supporter , asked the President what he would do differently if he got a " mulligan " or a " do over " on his Covid response , Trump replied , " not much . " 
" Look it ’s all over the world . 
You have a lot of great leaders , a lot of smart people , it ’s all over the world , " he said , before blaming China . 
The full Sinclair town hall airs on Wednesday night .
