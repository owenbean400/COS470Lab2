There will likely be longer air travel security lines as the Transportation Security Administration adjusts staffing with more people taking to the skies , according to Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf . 
More than 300,000 people passed through airport security checkpoints on Thursday , the first time that has happened since March . 
It â€™s also the first time in eight weeks that daily traffic at checkpoints was more than 10 % of the number of people screened last year , according to data from the TSA . 
There will be new efforts by the TSA to reduce person to person contact during security checks with travelers scanning their own boarding passes and they will also be asked to pack food in a separate bag , so fewer bags will have to be searched by officers , Wolf said an interview on Fox News on Saturday . 
TSA officers will be wearing masks and travelers are also encouraged to do so though not required when going through checkpoints , Wolf said . 
Wolf also said he thinks travel restrictions on China and parts of Europe need to stay in place " as we get the economy back up and running . "
