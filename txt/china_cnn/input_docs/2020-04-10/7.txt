Taiwan has accused Chinese internet users of pretending to be its citizens and publishing " racist comments " against WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said Friday . 
The report , published in the government run Central News Agency ( CNA ) , came after the Director General claimed Wednesday the island has targeted him in a series of " racist comments " in the past few months . 
" Giving me names , black or negro , " he said . 
" I 'm proud of being black , or proud of being negro , " he said during a press conference Wednesday . 
" I do not give a damn . " 
According to CNA 's report , the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau found that a number of online users -- who pretended to be from Taiwan -- have published " an increasing number of messages " admitting that they have made the racist comments . 
The bureau claimed that an investigation traced the users to mainland China , and criticized them for intentionally damaging Taiwan 's international reputation . 
On Thursday , Taiwan 's president Tsai Ing wen " strongly protested " against the accusation , adding that the island has always opposed all forms of discrimination . 
" For years , we have been excluded from international organizations , and we know better than anyone else what it feels like to be discriminated against and isolated , " she said Thursday . 
" Taiwan is dedicated to the values of freedom , democracy , diversity , and tolerance . 
We do not condone the use of racist remarks to attack those with different opinions . "
