As Wuhan , the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected late last year , leaves lockdown this week , much of the rest of the country is also relaxing controls . 
But there 's one area where restrictions are being ramped up : the internet . 
Censorship authorities announced this week a renewed campaign " targeting online pornography and illegal publications to create a healthy social and cultural environment . " 
Anti porn crackdowns have a long history of being used to go after political speech , and a state media report on the latest clean up left little doubt this will be the case again . 
" The campaign will also clear up illegal and harmful publications for children , blackmailing by fake journalists and unauthorized news outlets and copyright infringement , " state run news agency Xinhua said . 
This comes after weeks of ramped up censorship of topics relating to the coronavirus and the authorities ' handling of the pandemic , despite widespread criticism of how such stifling of discussion may have helped spread the virus in the first place .
