The Chinese government has issued a new draft list of livestock that can be farmed for meat in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic , which is suspected to have originated from wild animals in a Wuhan wet market . 
Beijing temporarily banned all trade in wild animals for food following the Covid 19 outbreak , but the new law has yet to be finalized . 
China 's Ministry of Agriculture issued a draft list of animals considered fit to be used as livestock on Wednesday night , including dietary staples such as pigs , cows , chickens and sheep , as well as " special livestock " such as a number of species of deer , alpaca and ostriches . 
Two species of fox , raccoons and minks can be kept as livestock but not for their meat . 
There is no mention of the species of animal which are suspected by scientists to have spread the coronavirus to humans , such as pangolins , bats and civet cats . 
Dogs are also absent from the list of livestock , which , if formally enforced , would lead to China 's first countrywide ban on their consumption in a victory for animal rights activists . 
The draft has still yet to be finalized and the public has until May 8 to provide feedback .
