Scientists at Oxford University have developed a 30 minute test for COVID 19 , which can be done anywhere . 
The raw materials for it cost about $ 25 . 
A team at the Engineering Science Laboratory , working with partner medics in China had an 8 week head start on developing the test , which uses a mix of chemicals and enzymes which turn from pink to yellow in color in the presence of the virus . 
The test has a huge advantage in both its speed , but also because the chemicals only need to be kept at 65°C ( or 150°F ) for half an hour , which can be done easily in any hospital , or even eventually at home . 
While there are hurdles ahead , the test may be able to complete clinical trials in the coming days . 
" We have 3 things to do , " Professor Zhengfang Cui , who led the team , said . 
" The first is to get clinical trials . 
We just started those here at Oxford University Hospital . 
The second thing is regulatory approval , which is based on the number of tests done . 
" The third is to get industry partners to implement large scale manufacture . 
For that , we need clean rooms and manufacturing facilities . 
And then we can roll out he product , " Zhenfang said , adding that he hoped the steps can be completed in 2 to 4 weeks .
