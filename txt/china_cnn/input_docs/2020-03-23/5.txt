Most non residents will be banned from entering Hong Kong from midnight Wednesday local time , Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced at a news conference on Monday . 
Non Hong Kong residents arriving from Macao , Taiwan and mainland China will be allowed to enter Hong Kong as long as they have not travelled abroad for the last 14 days . 
Travelers from Macao and Taiwan who enter Hong Kong will be subjected to mandatory 14 day quarantine â€“ which is already in place for most travelers , including those from mainland China . 
Travelers will also not be allowed to transit through Hong Kong airport . 
The strict new measures come as the number of confirmed cases in the city has almost doubled in the past week . 
Many of the cases were imported from overseas , as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad , or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- returned , bringing the virus back with them . 
Correction : This post has been updated to reflect that most travelers to Hong Kong will be banned from entering the territory from midnight on Wednesday and give more information on the ban .
