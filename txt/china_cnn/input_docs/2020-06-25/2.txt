The International Monetary Fund has slashed its global economic forecasts for 2020 , saying the coronavirus pandemic is causing a much steeper recession and a slower recovery than initially expected . 
The organization said Wednesday that it thinks global GDP will contract by 4.9 % this year , downgrading its estimate from April , when output was forecast to shrink by 3 % . 
That was already due to be the deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
The pandemic is causing an " unprecedented decline in global activity , " according to the IMF . 
It said the global labor market has taken a " catastrophic " hit , movement outside the home remains depressed , companies have cut back on investment and consumer spending has dropped significantly . 
Here is the IMF 's world economic forecast by country for June : Some key forecasts : China , which got a head start on the recovery , is expected to log growth of 1 % , in part due to policy support from the government . 
India 's economy , meanwhile , is forecast to shrink 4.5 % following a longer lockdown and slower than expected recovery . 
The US economy is expected to shrink by 8 % , while output across the 19 countries that use the euro could decline by 10.2 % . 
Countries in Latin America that are still struggling to contain the virus will also be hard hit . 
Brazil 's economy is expected to contract by 9.1 % , while output in Mexico could decline by 10.5 % . 
The outlook is slightly rosier than those provided by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which have recently forecast that global GDP would shrink by 5.2 % and 6 % , respectively , before rebounding in 2021 . 
But the IMF warned of a " higher than usual degree of uncertainty " around its forecast , which it said was based on a number of assumptions , including stable financial conditions .
