Beijing health officials have ruled out imported meat , eggs , and seafood as the cause of the virus outbreak at a sprawling food market . 
China 's capital reintroduced strict lockdown measures and rolled out mass testing after the outbreak emerged earlier this month at the Xinfadi market , which supplies most of Beijing 's fresh fruit and vegetables . 
Director of the Infectious Disease Department at the First Hospital of Peking University , Wang Gui Qiang tried to quell the fears of local residents by saying that " all meat , eggs , and seafood supplied in the regular supermarket are all safe to consume . " 
Wang acknowledged that the topic was of " great concern " to local residents , many of whom are afraid they could be infected by consuming meat and seafood after market officials blamed the outbreak on imported seafood . 
On Wednesday , a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal People â€™s Government said the coronavirus outbreak linked to the market has " basically been contained . "
