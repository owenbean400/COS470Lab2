Italy has said police may use drones to monitor movement in order to contain the coronavirus outbreak . 
The National Civil Aviation Authority ( ENAC ) authorized the use of drones to monitor the movements of citizens in municipal areas to ensure the containment of the epidemiological emergency , ENAC said Monday in a letter published on its official website . 
The letter was sent by ENAC to the Italian ministries of the Interior , Transport and Justice , the Air Force General Staff , the company that manages civil air traffic in Italy ( ENAV ) , the National Association of Italian Municipalities and the Local Police posts . 
When the outbreak in Italy began , authorities only locked down affected areas in the north . 
The entire country was put on lockdown on March 9 and those who break the rules now face $ 232 fines and six months ' prison time . 
Hundreds of thousands of Italians have been given police citations for flouting the ban and a Chinese Red Cross official last week said the measures -- among the strictest in Europe -- were not strict enough . 
On Friday , the military was called in to help enforce the rules as deaths spiked and hospitals buckled under the strain . 
By the weekend , authorities were forced to issue even more stringent restrictions . 
Yesterday saw a small decrease in cases and deaths for a second day . 
Italy confirmed 601 new coronavirus related deaths over 24 hours , bringing the total to 6,077 . 
Another 4,789 new cases were diagnosed , bringing the total number of cases to 63,927 .
