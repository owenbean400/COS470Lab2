Singapore 's recession may be much deeper than expected this year as the coronavirus pandemic continues to batter the wealthy city state . 
Officials there Tuesday slashed the country 's economic forecast for the third time this year . 
GDP growth is now set to drop between 4 % and 7 % -- down from an expected decline of 1 % to 4 % , according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry . 
The darkening outlook marks a major departure from just a few months ago . Earlier this year , Singapore was seen as one of the few countries that had its coronavirus response under control . 
But it has recently experienced an alarming second wave of infections , leading to heightened restrictions . 
The island nation now has 31,960 confirmed cases , up from just a few hundred in March , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Singapore was already headed for recession last year as its exports slumped due to the US China trade war . 
Now , " we think the economy is already in recession , " Sung Eun Jung , of Oxford Economics , wrote in a research note Tuesday . 
To shore up the flagging economy , the government has deployed billions of dollars in stimulus measures . 
A new package is also expected later on Tuesday , when Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat presents a relief plan for businesses in an address to parliament .
