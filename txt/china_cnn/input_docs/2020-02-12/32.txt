It 's too early to predict the end of the current novel coronavirus outbreak , said Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization 's health emergencies program . 
The number of new coronavirus cases being reported out of China has appeared to slow down . 
" The number of newly confirmed cases reported from China has stabilized over the past week , but that must be interpreted with extreme caution . 
This outbreak could still go in any direction , " WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during the news conference . 
At the news conference , Ryan said that the stabilization in cases is " reassuring " and is the " result of the huge public health operation in China . " 
WHO on Wednesday reported 44,730 cases of coronavirus in China , with 1,114 deaths . 
Outside of China , there are 441 cases and one death , according to WHO .
