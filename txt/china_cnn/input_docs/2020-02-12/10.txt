The global death toll from the novel coronavirus has topped 1,100 , but there are signs that the outbreak may be peaking at the epicenter of the crisis . 
Authorities in Hubei , the province where the outbreak likely originated , said there were an additional 1,638 confirmed cases of the virus as of this morning .

He added later that while the outbreak remains " very much an emergency " for China , there is a " realistic chance " of stopping it .
