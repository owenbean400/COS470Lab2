About 200 people who recently returned from China to the US state of Georgia are self monitoring for symptoms of the coronavirus , said the state 's Department of Health . 
The travelers were in mainland China , outside Hubei province , with no known high risk exposure . 
They show no symptoms and are self isolating at home , according to the department . 
How they identify travelers : Every day , Customs and Border Protection sends a list of Georgia travelers who have arrived from China to the state health department , which then reaches out to those travelers individually . 
The department makes a plan with these individuals to monitor themselves for symptoms , and gives them instructions on what to do if they get sick . 
So far , there are no Georgia travelers who have returned from Wuhan or Hubei province requiring quarantine , or any confirmed cases in Georgia , the department said . 
Cases in the US : There have been 13 confirmed cases in the US : seven in California , two in Illinois , and one each in Arizona , Massachusetts , Wisconsin , and Washington .
