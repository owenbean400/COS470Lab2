When a taxi driver showed up to pick up Priscilla Dickey and her 8 year old daughter from their home in Wuhan , China , he wore a blue hazmat suit . 
Dickey took a video on the familiar ride to the airport . 
The streets , which are normally clogged with traffic , were empty . 
The city of 11 million people has been on an unprecedented lockdown for nearly two weeks , with commercial flights stopped . 
Dickey and Hermione had hoped to leave on the first evacuation flight out last week but could not . 
This week , they boarded a flight charted by the US State Department to bring Americans home from Hubei province , where hundreds have died from the virus . 
An eerie cab ride to the airport on deserted streets . 
Health screenings . 
A long wait to board a flight home . 
A plane full of masked passengers . 
This is what it is like to be an American citizen evacuated out of Wuhan on a charter flight .
