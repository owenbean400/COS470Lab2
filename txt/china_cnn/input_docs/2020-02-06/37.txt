With several Chinese cities under lockdown , businesses closed , and residents staying home to avoid the coronavirus , travel within the country has dropped dramatically . 
Huang Xin , a director of the China Railway Group , said daily average passenger numbers are down 80 % from what they would typically be at this time of year . 
Lunar New Year just passed -- meaning these few weeks should be packed with travelers going home to celebrate , then returning to their cities of residence to continue work after the long public holiday . 
But in the past 15 days , the Chinese railway has only sold an average of 1.2 million tickets a day -- about a tenth of the original estimated figures , Huang Xin said . 
Safety measures on trains : In response to the coronavirus outbreak , trains are only selling 50 % of tickets available to make sure passengers can have one empty seat between them , Huang Xin said . 
Trains and train stations are also sanitized and disinfected regularly , and passengers have their temperatures checked before boarding .
