China announced on Thursday that it will halve additional tariffs on $ 75 billion worth of US imports , as the world 's two largest economies continue to step back from a years long trade war that has hurt both countries and dented global growth . 
The move comes as China is grappling with the escalating coronavirus outbreak . 
The disease has killed 565 people , mostly in China , and infected more than 28,000 people in over 25 countries and territories . 
The reduction affects US goods that China imposed tariffs on last September . 
Starting next week , China will cut the additional 10 % tariff rate it enacted back then on some goods to 5 % . 
Other goods that were taxed an extra 5 % will now be levied 2.5 % , according to a statement from China 's State Council Tariff Commission .
