There have not been any confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New Zealand so far , but one industry has been hit by the outbreak -- the crayfish industry . 
With the Chinese government closing borders and imposing travel restrictions , Chinese distributors have canceled import orders of rock lobster -- leaving about 165-200 tons of live lobsters sitting " in pots and tanks , at sea and on land , " said a statement from the New Zealand government . 
Fisheries Minister Stuart Nash said some of the rock lobsters can be released into the wild -- but this might affect the sustainability and health of the industry , and present biosecurity issues for the marine environment . 
Officials will have to find alternative , new markets in which to sell the remaining unreleased live lobsters .
