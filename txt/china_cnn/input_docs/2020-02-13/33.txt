Asymptomatic transmission of the novel coronavirus is possible , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told CNN . 
In other words , Redfield said that an infected person not showing symptoms could still transmit the virus to someone else based on information from his colleagues in China . 
" There ’s been good communication with our colleagues to confirm asymptomatic infection , to confirm asymptomatic transmission , to be able to get a better handle on the clinical spectrum of illness in China . 
What we do not know though is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving transmission , " he told CNN ’s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta in an interview on Thursday . 
Redfield continued : " What I ’ve learned in the last two weeks is that the spectrum of this illness is much broader than was originally presented . 
There ’s much more asymptomatic illness . 
A number of the confirmed cases that we confirmed actually just presented with a little sore throat . "
