This bring the total number of cases on the ship to 219 , including one Japanese quarantine officer -- the largest outbreak of the virus outside of mainland China . 
Kato did not give a breakdown by nationality of the new cases , nor of passengers versus crew . 
Floating quarantine : More than 3,700 passengers and crew are stuck on the cruise ship in Yokohama that became a floating quarantine zone after dozens of people tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month . 
The number of infections is increasing by the day . 
On Wednesday , Kato announced 40 new cases among those on board . 
CNN â€™s latest tally indicates that at least 24 Americans have tested positive . 
Some respite : The health minister also said that people who have tested negative for the virus and are over 80 years old , or have a non virus medical condition requiring attention , will be allowed to leave the ship and move to a government medical facility , if they wish . 
He did not give a timeline for that process . 
An unknown number of passengers with non virus medical conditions were allowed to disembark earlier on Tuesday .
