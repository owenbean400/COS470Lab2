China has moved to dismiss key party officials as the coronavirus outbreak shows no sign of abating in the country . 
Jiang Chaoliang will be replaced by Shanghai mayor Ying Yong as Hubei Communist Party chief in a major shakeup of provincial leadership , according to China â€™s state run Xinhua News Agency . 
Wuhan Communist Party chief Ma Guoqiang has also been replaced by Wang Zhonglin , party chief of Jinan city in Shandong province , according to Xinhua . 
These moves come after two officials in charge of the provincial health authority were sacked early this week .
