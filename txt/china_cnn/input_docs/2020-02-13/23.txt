The amount of oil needed to run the global economy will decline sharply in the first quarter of this year as the coronavirus forces factories to close in China , snarls transportation and hits supply chains . 
Global oil demand in the first three months of 2020 is expected to drop by 435,000 barrels per day compared to a year earlier , according to the International Energy Agency , the first quarterly decline in more than a decade . 
The agency also marked down its forecast for oil demand growth for the whole of 2020 . 
It is now expected to increase by just 825,000 barrels per day , the weakest annual pace since 2011 . 
The IEA said in its monthly oil report that the impact from the coronavirus was difficult to measure at this stage . 
" The onset of [ the coronavirus ] will likely have a large impact on both the world 's economy and oil demand , " said the agency . 
" Consequences will vary over time , with the initial economic hit on transportation and services , likely followed by Chinese industry , then eventually exports and the broader economy . " 
However the IEA did say there is " little doubt " that coronavirus will have a bigger impact on oil demand and the global economy than the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak in 2003 . 
" While steps taken in China to reduce its spread were adopted earlier than in the SARS crisis and have been far more extensive , the profound transformation of the world economy since 2003 means China 's slowdown today is bound to have a stronger global impact , " it said .
