Yesterday Chinese officials broadened their definition of what constitutes a confirmed coronavirus case , to include " clinically diagnosed cases " -- i.e . people diagnosed on the basis of their symptoms rather than testing positive . 
This has led to a huge spike in the number of cases reported -- 14,840 in just one day . 
But this kind of tweaked definition is " normal , " said the World Health Organization . 
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 60,015 -- the vast majority in mainland China .
