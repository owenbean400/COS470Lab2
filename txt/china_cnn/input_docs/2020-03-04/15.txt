Beijing 's public transport network plans to experiment with " subway by appointment , " starting on Friday morning . 
The transit operator said on Thursday that passengers were encouraged to make an appointment to enter two commuter heavy stations during morning rush hours . 
Using one of five authorized apps , passengers will be able to make an appointment for a spot to enter one of the two stations the next day . 
They will receive a QR code on their smartphones if they complete the process successfully . 
The code is valid for half an hour around the time chosen by the passengers . 
The aim is to reduce crowding in stations and on trains during the outbreak , as well as waiting time outside stations , according to the subway operator . 
Beijing Subway is the busiest in China with a daily ridership of over 10 million .
