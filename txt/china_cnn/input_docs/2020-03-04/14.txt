China 's air pollutant levels dropped in February as a result of measures taken by the nation 's government to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus , the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service confirmed on Wednesday . 
" The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ( CAMS ) observed a decrease of fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) for February relative to the previous three years , " said the CAMS in a report . 
It said PM2.5 was one of the " most important air pollutants regarding health impacts , " according to the World Health Organization . 
Analysis by the CAMS showed a reduction of approximately 20-30 % in air pollutants over large parts of China in February compared with monthly averages in February 2017 , 2018 and 2019 . 
The CAMS said the reduction is a likely side effect of measures taken by the Chinese government , including restrictions on industry and traffic . 
Copernicus is the European Union â€™s flagship Earth observation service , which analyzes temperature data from around the planet .
