The scene at the Great Wall of China this past week would have been unthinkable just months ago . Photos of the tourist attraction in Beijing last weekend show massive crowds crammed along the winding wall , pressed together in close quarters and squeezing past each other through narrow doorways . 
Most are wearing face masks -- but a number of people , including young children , pulled their masks down to their chin , and a few seem to have foregone masks entirely . 
It 's Golden Week -- an eight day national holiday , one of China 's busiest annual travel periods , and a major test for the country as it emerges from the coronavirus pandemic . 
China 's official reported virus numbers have stayed low since the spring . 
There have been a few flare ups , including a cluster in Beijing in June , but these were met with immediate lockdown measures and mass testing , and the outbreaks were contained within a few weeks . 
With close to zero local transmissions , people flocked to bus stations , airports and transit hubs to travel around the country for the holiday , which kicked off on October 1 . 
Local authorities competed to attract tourists , with provincial and municipal governments issuing travel vouchers and tourist attractions offering free or discounted tickets . 
The Great Wall has geared up for the rush of tourists as well . 
The most popular section of the wall -- the Badaling section -- reopened at the end of March , albeit with new restrictions like requiring visitors to reserve tickets in advance .
