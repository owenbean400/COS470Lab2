President Donald Trump 's top health advisers say that the coronavirus pandemic has driven America to its knees amid a disturbing surge in cases . 
But Trump is ignoring the new danger , instead using the worst domestic crisis in decades as a racist punchline . 
Political mismanagement of the situation , the glaring lack of a national strategy and the nation 's exhausting , inconclusive struggle with the coronavirus was reflected Tuesday in three key developments . 
Fully half of US states are now seeing rising cases of the disease with the situation especially acute in Texas , Florida and Arizona , which embraced aggressive reopening programs . 
The European Union , which has been more successful than the US in suppressing Covid 19 , warned it might bar visitors from America in what would be a major embarrassment for Trump . 
And the President persisted with his counter logical argument that the US is only seeing more cases of the virus because it is doing more testing , leaving the implication that it would be better if rising cases , infections and ultimately deaths were simply ignored . 
Trump spent the day in Arizona and held a rally in Phoenix , a city where mask wearing is mandatory in public . 
But he refused to don a face covering , along with many supporters who attended his indoor event . 
And he delighted his fans by reciting a racist name for the virus referencing its origin in China . 
" Kung flu ? " 
Trump said , prompting roars from his crowd .
