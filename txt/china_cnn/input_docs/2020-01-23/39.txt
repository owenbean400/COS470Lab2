A group of Chinese exchange students visiting the US are no longer participating in on campus activities with Longfellow Middle School students in Fairfax County , Virginia , according to a letter from the administration sent to parents yesterday . 
" While health officials believe the risk of illness transmission of the novel Coronavirus from these students is extremely low , we felt it necessary to make this adjustment , " it said in the letter . 
According to school spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell , the students are visiting from Yi Chang , which is located in the Hubei province . 
Wuhan is the capital of Hubei . 
The exchange students are expected to stay in the DC area for a week before making other stops in the United States , Caldwell said . 
Longfellow Middle School students have an exchange trip to Yi Chang scheduled for early April that has not been canceled yet . 
They will monitor the situation and make a determination at a later time , Caldwell said . 
Caldwell provided CNN with a copy of letter sent to parents :
