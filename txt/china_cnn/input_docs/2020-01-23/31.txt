Macao ’s Government Tourism Office has announced all Lunar New Year festivities are being canceled " due to the Wuhan coronavirus . " 
The semi autonomous Chinese city and gambling enclave confirmed its first case of the virus on Wednesday . 
Dr . Lei Chin ion , the director of the Macao Health Bureau , said Wednesday a 52 year old woman from Wuhan was confirmed as being infected with the virus after she went to hospital in Macao on January 21 . 
She had arrived in Macao from Wuhan on January 19 and had traveled by train and bus , Lei said at a news conference today . 
She claims she had no contact with anyone with a confirmed Wuhan coronavirus back home , Lei said . 
Macao joins neighboring Hong Kong in calling off New Year festivities , albeit for very different reasons . 
Earlier this month Hong Kong officials announced that the city ’s traditional fireworks display in Victoria Harbor , held on the second day of the Lunar New Year holiday , would be canceled for security reasons due to the ongoing anti government protests .
