Fear and anxiety is mounting in China , with controversy on social media over residents who apparently fled Wuhan ahead of the partial lockdown enforced on Thursday . 
On the microblogging platform Weibo , people shared their fears over the virus , as well as cautionary warnings . 
" Do not panic and try not to go out , " one person warned . 
Another person posted they had thought about fleeing Wuhan . 
" I was thinking about my parents and children -- if I bring them , where can we escape to ? " read the post . 
Controversy over evacuees : On early Thursday morning , train stations in Wuhan were packed with people trying to get out of the city before the blockade went into effect . 
Crowds jammed together , trying to get on the last few trains out of the city of 11 million people . 
The rush to get out has even got its own hashtag on Weibo -- # Escape From Wuhan . 
But the mass exodus has been met with anger from many Weibo users , who accused people leaving Wuhan of being selfish and irresponsible as they could then potentially spread the virus . 
" Wuhan people , get out of Shanghai , " one person posted . 
" Do not sneak in and spread chaos . "
