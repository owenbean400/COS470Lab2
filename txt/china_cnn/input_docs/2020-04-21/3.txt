The coronavirus pandemic has put a damper on many activities , including Hong Kong 's anti government protests . 
But anger in the city has not gone away , nor has the protest movement gone completely dormant , even as restrictions on gatherings and a desire to avoid infection has put a temporary halt to the kind of mass demonstrations seen in 2019 . 
Just as the extradition bill which sparked last year 's protests gave a shot in the arm to a movement that was looking all but defeated , recent moves by Beijing and the Hong Kong police have also reinvigorated opposition in the city . 
Covid crisis eases : This comes as the city begins to consider relaxing coronavirus restrictions , with local cases dwindling to just a handful per day . 
While there have been small , sporadic protests throughout winter and into spring , even with the pandemic concerns , a major rally on July 1 could be the first major test of the protest movement 's ongoing public support this year . 
July 1 , the date of Hong Kong 's 1997 handover from British rule to China , has traditionally been a day of protest , with tens of thousands taking to the streets every year .
