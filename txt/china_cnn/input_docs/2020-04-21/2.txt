US President Donald Trump made several false claims at his White House coronavirus briefing on Monday . 
Here 's a fact check on what he said : Trump said people were talking about the need for more coronavirus testing because they want to damage him politically . 
Asked why he sees the bipartisan outcry over testing as a personal attack , Trump said , " It 's not bipartisan . 
It 's mostly partisan . " 
Fact check : Concerns about testing are indeed bipartisan . 
The Republican governors of Ohio , Nebraska , Maryland and Massachusetts , as well as Republican Congress members , have all spoken out about the need for more testing . 
Trump said he had not " left the White House in months " except to send off the USNS Comfort , a hospital ship sent from Virginia to aid New York . 
Fact check : Trump held five campaign rallies in February and one on March 2 . 
He left the White House on several occasions in March . 
Trump said the US used to have a $ 500 billion trade deficit with China , citing this figure as evidence of how he believes the US has been taken advantage of economically under previous administrations . 
Trump claimed before he took office , China " came in and they took $ 500 billion a year for many years , anywhere from $ 200 ( billion ) to $ 550 billion a year out of our hides . " 
Fact check : There has never been a $ 500 billion or $ 550 billion trade deficit with China .
