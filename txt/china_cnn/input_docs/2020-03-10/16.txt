China 's Hubei province announced today that it will issue health codes for residents who want to travel within the province , in the first stage of a gradual lifting of travel restrictions . 
Travel bans and restrictions have been imposed across the province since January , with the capital Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , placed under total lockdown . 
Now , the restrictions are slowly beginning to lift -- and the first stage will allow residents to apply for a government issued QR health code through smartphone apps , which will then be verified by the provincial epidemic prevention database . 
Residents will be given one of three color QR codes : green , yellow or red . 
The codes will be issued within 24 hours , but it is unclear how soon the residents may be able to travel . 
Green code holders from low and medium risk areas will be allowed to travel within the province . 
Green code holders in high risk areas will be able to travel in accordance with regulations of the local prevention department . 
Yellow code holders will not be allowed to travel . 
Red code holders will need to be treated and quarantined . 
QR codes are also currently used outside of Hubei to identify people â€™s health status and track where they have been to help monitor the spread of the virus .
