China 's state run news agency Xinhua has released several photographs of President Xi Jinping visiting Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan -- one of the emergency facilities built in a matter of days to handle the influx of patients at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak . 
Xi is seen chatting with what looks like several medical workers and members of the military , all wearing bright turquoise masks . 
Another photograph shows what appears to be Xi video chatting with a patient . 
Xi 's visit to Wuhan -- which has been on lockdown for weeks now , with tens of thousands of confirmed cases of the virus and hundreds of deaths -- is a major show of confidence in China 's response to the pandemic , underlining the message building in state media that the country has turned a corner . 
Senior government officials , including Vice Premier Sun Chunlan and Premier Li Keqiang , have visited Wuhan , but it was assumed until now that the risk to Xi , even if slight , was not worth the potential cost . 
Li was photographed wearing a similar mask and a hospital gown when he visited Wuhan in January .
