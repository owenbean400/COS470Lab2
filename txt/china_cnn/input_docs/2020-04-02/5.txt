One of the New England Patriots ’ team planes is flying back to Boston carrying N95 masks Massachusetts Gov . 
Charlie Baker ordered from China . 
According to a source , Baker is extremely frustrated that the federal government outbid him on stuff that was en route to Massachusetts . 
He worked with New England Patriots ’ owner Robert Kraft and the Patriots to get these supplies brought over from China . 
The governor posted a photo of the plane being loaded up with medical supplies , tweeting this : In a longer statement provided to CNN , Baker said , " As I said before , ordering vital equipment like this is only one part of the challenge and I am incredibly grateful that the Krafts worked this issue relentlessly alongside our Command Center staff to get these critical supplies to Massachusetts . 
The Krafts , our partners Ambassador Huang Ping , Dr . Jason Li , Gene Hartigan and our Covid 19 Command Center personnel teamed up to get this job done and we eagerly await the plane landing at Logan Airport soon . 
Our administration will keep pursuing the PPE necessary to support our brave front line workers who are working tirelessly to save lives during this pandemic . " 
CNN Sports has reached out to the Patriots for comment but we have not heard back yet .
