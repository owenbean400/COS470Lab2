Getting the flu vaccine is more important this year than it ever has been before , said Dr . Anne Schuchat , principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
People want to avoid getting flu anyway , during normal times , Schuchat said . 
Averting flu during the Covid 19 pandemic could prevent people from having to get tested for other respiratory illnesses . 
" The kind of person that should be tested for Covid probably should be tested for flu , and they can have both at the same time , " she said . 
Data from China has suggested that people can have both viruses at the same time , Schuchat said . 
CDC has developed a test that looks for both flu strains and Covid 19 at the same time . 
It ’s being reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization . 
" We ’ve also updated guidance about how to get vaccine out in this era , " Schuchat said . 
" You do not really want a big , mass crowd of people , " she added . 
There is also guidance on how to distance while you ’re getting a flu vaccine .
