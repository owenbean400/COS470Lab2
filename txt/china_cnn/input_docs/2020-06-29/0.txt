Some 400,000 residents in Anxin County in China 's Hebei province near Beijing have been placed under new lockdown measures amid a small increase in coronavirus cases . 
The statement adds that families are only permitted to send one family member out of their house each day to purchase supplies , and that all non locally registered vehicles are not permitted to enter the area . 
Hebei ’s Provincial Health Commission said that ever since Beijing 's Xinfadi market cluster was discovered on June 11 , Xiong ’an New District -- where Anxin County is located -- has reported 13 locally transmitted cases and six asymptomatic cases . 
The Anxin local government announcement also mentions that they have implemented the new lockdown because the pandemic prevention and control situation in the county is " still serious . " 
Anxin , a relatively rural and sparsely populated county , is located around 90 miles ( 145 km ) south of China ’s capital Beijing , which had seen a spike in coronavirus cases linked to the Xinfadi market in the past two weeks . 
Officials have since said the outbreak in Beijing has been " basically contained . " 
China reported 12 new cases of the virus on Sunday , including seven local infections in Beijing and five imported cases across Sichuan , Liaoning and Shanghai .
