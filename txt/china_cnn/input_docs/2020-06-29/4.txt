European Union member states had been given till lunchtime tomorrow to sign off on a list of 15 non EU states that would be allowed to travel into the bloc , two EU diplomats , who were not permitted to speak on the record about EU policy that is not yet formally agreed , have told CNN . 
As expected , the US was not included in the list of nations allowed . 
The first phase was only expected to include countries whose current coronavirus data shows they are handling the pandemic at least as well as the EU . 
The US does not currently meet this criteria , and it 's unclear when it might be considered for inclusion on any EU safe travel list . 
The list of approved countries includes China , where the virus originated , on the condition that China offered reciprocal arrangements . 
The other 14 countries are : Algeria Australia Canada Georgia Japan Montenegro Morocco New Zealand Rwanda Serbia South Korea Thailand Tunisia Uruguay The EU is also working on guidelines for how member states would lift travel restrictions , as border control is not handled at an EU level .
