President Trump called the travel ban for Brazil , which started earlier this week , a " very strong ban , " but said US citizens would be permitted reentry . 
" Brazil now , we have the ban on . 
The ban ’s been put on and it ’s a very strong ban except we do have Americans that we have to allow – like I did with the China ban – we do have to allow people to come back into the country . 
We ca not be that tough where we do not allow United States citizens to come back in , " Trump said . 
" But they come back in under a very strict , whether it ’s a quarantine or not , we test them and we go through a process , " he said , turning over to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf . 
Wolf said US citizens and others coming into the US from Brazil and other countries with travel bans in place go through immigration checks where they are asked questions and receive random temperature checks and contact tracing is conducted .
