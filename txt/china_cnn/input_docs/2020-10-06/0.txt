China is in talks with the World Health Organization to have its locally produced vaccines included in the " emergency use listing , " a WHO official said Tuesday . 
According to WHO , the Emergency Use Listing is a " risk based procedure for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines , therapeutics and in vitro diagnostics with the ultimate aim of expediting the availability of these products to people affected by a public health emergency . " 
In order for a vaccine to be submitted to the Emergency Use Listing , manufacturers must supply manufacturing quality data , non clinical data , and clinical data to the WHO , as well as a plan to monitor quality , safety , and efficacy in the field and an undertaking to submit any new data to WHO as soon as the new data are available .
