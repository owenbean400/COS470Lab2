China 's state owned pharmaceutical company Sino Pharm said that " hundreds of thousands " of people in the country have received Covid 19 vaccinations under an emergency use program . 
The company 's general counsel Zhou Song said Sino Pharm has provided emergency vaccinations to high risk groups , including medical professionals , diplomats deployed to high risk areas , and workers for state owned enterprises who participate in the Belt and Road Initiative , according to a statement on its website . 
" ( The vaccines ) have been applied ... hundreds of thousands of times , and there was not a single case that demonstrated significant negative effects , nor was anyone infected , " Zhou said . 
In the statement , Sino Pharm said it is currently developing two Covid 19 vaccines , and both vaccines are now in Phase 3 clinical trial . 
The company also claimed that 100 million doses of Covid 19 vaccines can be produced by the end of this year . 
Zhou said that " the vaccines were proven effective " because none of those who traveled to high risk places after receiving the injections were infected with Covid 19 . 
He added that individuals receiving the vaccine will have to get two doses to generate antibodies , with the second shot coming two to four weeks after the first shot . 
Wu Guizhen , chief biosecurity expert of China 's CDC , told China 's state run broadcaster CGTN on Monday that Covid 19 vaccines will be ready by November . 
" The public can start taking the vaccine around November or December as the performance of Phase III trials goes well , " said Wu .
