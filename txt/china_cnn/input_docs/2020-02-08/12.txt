Getting groceries delivered through Alibaba , the Chinese e commerce giant , has become a different experience in China since the coronavirus outbreak . 
After a Saturday order on Alibaba 's grocery site , a message popped up on my phone : Many residential compounds in major cities across China , including the capital , are now strictly limiting access to residents only . 
Delivery people are no longer allowed in . 
Recipients usually have to go outside to pick up their orders . 
In my compound , delivery people have taken to pushing grocery bags through the gap between a now locked side gate and the floor .
