At midnight Saturday , authorities in Hong Kong began imposing 14 days ' quarantine for all travelers arriving from mainland China . 
Hong Kong 's Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters that 161 people had been placed under quarantine Saturday , 148 of whom are isolated at home . 
Eleven others are in hotels or two other facilities . 
" We will call them [ those quarantined at home ] to ensure they are home and remind them not to leave , otherwise it 's illegal and they will be subject to a six month imprisonment . 
We also do random check ups -- in fact , police have already done 10 and everyone has been at home , " she said . 
She said authorities considered the travelers a low risk , but explained they would be required to check in with the government to confirm their live locations via Whats App or We Chat . 
As of 4 p.m . Saturday , a total of 8,953 people came to Hong Kong , the vast majority through the airport . 
Lam announced the new measure to quarantine travelers from the mainland on Wednesday , saying it was only the second time the measure had been enacted .
