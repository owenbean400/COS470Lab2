Manchester United 's newest signee Odion Ighalo will not join his teammates for training camp in Spain because travel restrictions linked to the coronavirus may prevent him from returning to England , the team 's manager said . 
The 30 year old joined the Premier League club in a deadline day loan from Shanghai Shenhua and arrived in Manchester from China only in the past 14 days . 
" Because of the situation in China , we 're not sure if he 'd be allowed back into England if he leaves the country again , so he 's staying here working with a personal coach , individual programme and his family then can settle in England as well . 
That 's a plus , " United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told the team 's in house TV station .
