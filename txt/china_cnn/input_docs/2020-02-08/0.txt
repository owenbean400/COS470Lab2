There 's still a lot we do not know about the Wuhan coronavirus , and scientists around the world are racing to gather data to develop a treatment . 
Here 's what we can tell you so far : Is there a cure ? 
No -- but there are signs of progress . 
Doctors in Thailand said earlier this week they successfully treated a patient with a combination of antiviral drugs . 
What are the symptoms ? 
Coronavirus symptoms can look like the flu -- people get a fever , a cough , trouble breathing . 
If you have these symptoms and recently went to China , or have been in contact with someone who did , experts advise going to the doctor . 
How does the virus spread ? 
The virus is thought to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing . 
There 's also a possibility the virus can exist in and spread through contaminated fecal matter . 
There 's currently no evidence that the virus is airborne -- meaning it does not travel across a large room . 
Who is at risk of infection ? 
People of all ages can be infected with the virus , but older people and those with pre existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable to severe complications . 
How can I protect myself ? 
Take the same precautionary measures you would during flu season . 
Wash your hands often with soap and water , cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough , avoid close contact with people and large gatherings , and wear a face mask . 
Is it safe to travel ? 
Many countries including the US have advised against travel to China . 
Many airlines have suspended travel to and from China , and countries have implemented bans on travelers from China .
