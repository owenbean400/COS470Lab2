The outbreak in Beijing , which has infected more than 100 people , will be the latest test of China 's coronavirus containment strategy . 
On Thursday , Wu Zunyou , chief epidemiologist at China 's Center for Disease Control , struck a victorious tone , declaring that the outbreak in Beijing is already " under control . " 
Wu said that it is still likely that there will be newly confirmed cases linked to the market emerging in the coming days -- but it is not likely due to fresh transmission . 
The chief epidemiologist said that it was not unexpected to see a new outbreak in Beijing , given the large number of new global cases . 
" As long as there are risks of imported cases , imported infections and small scale clusters caused by imported infections might occur anywhere in China . 
From this point of view , ( the Beijing outbreak ) is normal , " he said .
