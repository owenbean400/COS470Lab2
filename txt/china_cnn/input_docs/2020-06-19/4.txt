Until last week , Beijing seemed to have all but moved on from the coronavirus pandemic . 
For 55 days , the Chinese capital had not reported any locally transmitted infections and life had been returning to normal . 
But that facade of normality was shattered when a fresh cluster of coronavirus cases emerged from a sprawling wholesale food market in the city , infecting more than 180 people as of Friday . 
Within a matter of days , the metropolis of more than 20 million people was placed under a partial lockdown . 
Authorities reintroduced restrictive measures used earlier to fight the initial wave of infections , sealing off residential neighborhoods , closing schools and barring hundreds of thousands of people deemed at risk of contracting the virus from leaving the city . 
The flare up of infections in Beijing , the seat of Communist Party power and previously considered among the country 's safest cities , is a stark reminder of how easily the virus can come back to haunt places where it was thought to have been tamed . 
The current outbreak in Beijing is the worst resurgence of the coronavirus yet , and authorities are still trying to track down its source . 
Previously , reports had linked the outbreak to seafood or meat , after traces of the virus were reportedly detected on a chopping board used by a seller of imported salmon at the market . 
However , there are now concerns that the virus had been quietly spreading for weeks before it was first detected .
