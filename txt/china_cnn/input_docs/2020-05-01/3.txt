UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres lamented a " lack of leadership " among the international community 's response to the pandemic during a press conference in New York on Thursday . 
His comments came amidst a mounting war of words between the US and China . 
President Donald Trump said he believes China 's handling of the pandemic is proof that Beijing " will do anything they can " to make him lose his re election bid in November . 
Chinese state media Global Times tweeted Thursday that China has no interest in interfering with the US election , attributing the statement to the Foreign Ministry . 
The tweet tagged Trump . 
When asked about the need for cooperation between China and the US , Guterres replied : " The contribution of China and the United States , both to fight Covid 19 , but to all other aspects in the development of international relations is , in my opinion , absolutely essential , and I hope that it will become possible in the future . " 
" Now is the time to be determined , " he added . 
" Determined to defeat Covid 19 and to emerge from this crisis by building a better world for all . "
