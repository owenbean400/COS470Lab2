The severity of the novel coronavirus is higher than flu — but perhaps not as high as the 2.3 % death rate that has been reported by Chinese authorities , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN today . 
" My sense and the sense of many of my colleagues is that the ultimate case fatality rate … is less than 2 % , " Fauci said . 
This would mean the novel coronavirus is more lethal than flu but far less lethal that SARS , which comes from the same family of viruses . 
However , Fauci noted the novel coronavirus is more transmissible than SARS , which infected far fewer people . 
Fauci 's comments follow a study published yesterday by scientists at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , calculating a case fatality rate of 2.3 % — meaning 2.3 % of people found to be infected with the virus have died . 
" I would think at tops it ’s 2 % , " Fauci said . 
" And it likely will go down when all the counting gets done to 1 % or less . " 
" That ’s still considerable if you look at the possibility that you ’re dealing with a global pandemic , " he added .
