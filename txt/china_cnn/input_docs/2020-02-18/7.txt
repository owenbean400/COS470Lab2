Singapore is increasing isolation conditions for those who have returned or transited through mainland China , the Ministry of Health said Tuesday . 
Previously , Singapore had issued a 14 day " Leave of Absence " ( LOA ) notice , which " allowed returnees to leave their homes briefly , for example for their meals or to buy household supplies , " a news release said . 
Now , travelers must abide by a " Stay Home Notice " ( SHN ) , which means they 'll " have to remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14 day period . " 
" Those placed on the SHN will be reminded to monitor their health closely and minimise contact with others , " the statement said . 
The new rules apply to Singapore residents , long term pass holders and returning workers from mainland China on work passes . 
The ministry said support will be available for those who need assistance in getting " food and daily necessities . "
