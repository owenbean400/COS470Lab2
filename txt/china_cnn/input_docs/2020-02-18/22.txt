Economists at the research firm Capital Economics have tried to estimate the impact the novel coronavirus outbreak could have on Japan 's already struggling economy . 
The world 's third biggest economy is already flirting with recession , and the novel coronavirus could push it over the edge . 
The outbreak is already hurting Japan 's important tourism sector . 
" The number of air passenger leaving Hong Kong has plunged by 90 % since the Lunar New Year and tourist arrivals from China may have fallen by a similar amount , " Marcel Thieliant , Capital Economics ' senior Japan economist , wrote in a note on Tuesday . 
Thieliant said the slump in tourist arrivals will most likely knock around 0.4 percentage points off Japan 's GDP growth in the first quarter . 
However , he added there was " a growing risk " that an outbreak of the virus in Japan could hurt consumer spending . 
The firm now expects Japan 's economy to shrink by 0.5 % in 2020 .
