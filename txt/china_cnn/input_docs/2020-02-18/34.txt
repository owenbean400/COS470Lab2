With a majority of some US medical supplies coming from or originating in China , coronavirus could hold " chilling implications " by hindering that pipeline , according to Robert P . Kadlec , assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
About timing : The US might not see the impacts just yet because American buyers typically stock up before Chinese factories slow down during the Lunar New Year , Kadlec added . 
These concerns extend not just to pharmaceuticals but also to other materials like face masks , which are frequently manufactured in China . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the use of face masks for the general American public . 
By buying them up in large quantities , Kadlec warned that Americans might leave fewer for some people who really need them — namely , health care workers . 
Kadlec said , " We probably need to change the way we do business in these areas because of the significant risks and vulnerabilities that are being highlighted by this event . " 
He added that the solution requires a whole government approach in cooperation with the private — " It 's everybody . " 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , agreed , saying , " We ca not see them crash . 
If they crash , we have a problem . "
