The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says " several " airport screeners have been directed to self quarantine after two contractors who were screening passengers arriving from China at Los Angeles International Airport subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus , according to CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund . 
CNN has previously reported on the two positive tests , but not the subsequent quarantine of other screeners . 
The contractors were working for the Department of Homeland Security . 
Nordlund said the CDC and the local health department are investigating the exposures , but do not know if the employees were exposed during their screening duties . 
Because the two people who tested positive interacted with other screeners , Nordlund said several others are now under quarantine . 
Nordlund said the CDC and DHS are working to re staff screening operations at LAX , including bringing staff from other quarantine stations .
