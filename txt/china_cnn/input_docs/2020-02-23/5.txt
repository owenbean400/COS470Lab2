Princess Cruises , which operates the Diamond Princess cruise liner , has announced a search for a " best in class " cleaning and disinfection service , to get the ship operational again after a weeks long quarantine in the Japanese port of Yokohama . 
Hundreds of people on board the ship were found to have contracted the coronavirus , the worst outbreak outside of mainland China . 
Disembarkation began this week after a 14 day quarantine , but some passengers who left have since tested positive for the virus causing concern that the quarantine may have failed . 
Cleaning of the 115,875 ton passenger vessel will not be an easy task . 
Princess Cruises said jobs that need doing include " the removal and proper disposal of all towels ( bath , face , hand ) , bed linens , mattress pads , pillows , duvets , shower curtains , and mattresses , " as well as the disinfection of curtains and other soft furnishings , while the extensive ventilation system will need cleaning , along with public areas such the spa , gym and restaurants . 
While Princess Cruises is being public about the disinfection work , it may struggle to attract passengers back to the ship , which was headline news for weeks . 
The cruise industry as a whole is fearing a major slowdown over the outbreak .
