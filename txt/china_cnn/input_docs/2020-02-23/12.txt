The South Korean religious group at the center of a dramatic spike in coronavirus cases in the country has rejected a storm of criticism over the outbreak . 
Roughly half of the more than 600 cases in South Korea are associated with the controversial religious group , leading to 9,300 Shincheonji members being put into self isolation . 
Outside a shuttered building in Seoul that houses offices and places of worship for Shincheonji , a shopkeeper called the group " heretics " in an interview with CNN . 
But Kim So il , a project director at Shincheonji , defended the group , saying it was in " great difficulty " right now . 
That was the view reflected by a Shincheonji spokesperson in a televised press conference Sunday , who said the religious group 's members are the " biggest victims ' " of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea . 
" COVID 19 is a disease that originated in China and spread to South Korea , " the spokesperson said . 
The Shincheonji is centered around the personality of its founder and chairman , Lee Man hee . 
On a website believed to be the group 's official homepage , the group heavily suggests that Lee is the " Promised Pastor " mentioned in the Bible . 
The passage it highlights suggests that the Promised Pastor is the second coming of Jesus Christ . 
Members of the group congregate in a way that puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time . 
Jung Eun Kyeong , director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said at a press briefing on Friday : " ( We are ) seeing that there is a possibility that the characteristics of many people sitting close together in a very confined space and holding service for more than an hour ... ( could have led to ) a few who were exposed infecting many ( other ) infectees . " 
The group has said that it " deeply regrets " the outbreak which occurred in their branch in the southern city of Daegu .
