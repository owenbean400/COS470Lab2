Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN the US needed more resources to fight the coronavirus outbreak , which has infected 53 people in the US . 
" We ’ve had a pandemic preparedness plan that we really developed in preparation for pandemic influenza , that we can extrapolate to this . 
We certainly need more resources , and that ’s what you heard today with the supplemental request . 
Because we can only go a certain way with the resources we have , " Fauci said . 
Death rate : Fauci added that the fatality rate of the outbreak could reach the same levels in the US as in China because there is no vaccine or cure available .
