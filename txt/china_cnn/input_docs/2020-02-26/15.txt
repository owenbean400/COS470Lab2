Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the Food and Drug Administration is closely monitoring pharmaceuticals made in China during the coronavirus outbreak . 
Rep . 
Kay Granger , the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee , asked Azar during a budget hearing about what the US is doing to ensure the safety of the American drug supply . 
The FDA is reaching out to pharmaceutical and device manufacturers , Azar said . 
" The latest fruits of that work show that there are 20 pharmaceutical products we are aware of to date at FDA where either the entire product is made in China , or there is a critical active ingredient that is solely sourced within China , so those would be , obviously , the most targeted to be concerned about , " he said . 
Azar added , " I 'm told there are two manufacturers in Hubei province of pharmaceuticals , but fortunately the manufacturer has a large , large stockpile of supply of advanced production there , but we have to be very alert to this and we have to be candid that there could be disruptions in supplies .
