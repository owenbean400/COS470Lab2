The Hong Kong government has announced a dramatic economic relief package worth 120 billion Hong Kong dollars ( $ 15.4 billion ) . 
Financial secretary Paul Chan said in a budget speech Wednesday that all permanent residents in the city will receive 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ( $ 1,280 ) to boost local consumption and counter the fallout from the slumping economy . 
Handout plan : " The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus has dealt a severe blow to economic activities and sentiment in Hong Kong , " Chan told the city 's legislature . 
" I have decided to implement counter cyclical measures of a massive scale involving above HK$120 billion so as to meet the public ’s expectations as far as possible . " 
The handouts will cost about 71 billion Hong Kong dollars ( $ 9.1 billion ) in total , and are expected to benefit around 7 million people . 
The government said it would announce details of the scheme soon after obtaining funding approval from local lawmakers . 
A hard year for Hong Kong : Chan said that the economic environment was " austere " in 2019 , due to a series of factors including the US China trade conflict and the slowing global economy . 
" To sum up , Hong Kong ’s economy is facing enormous challenges this year . 
The outlook is far from promising in the near term , " he said . 
The financial secretary warned that a record high deficit will be recorded next year , but also noted that he believes Hong Kong ’s economic fundamentals remained solid in the long term .
