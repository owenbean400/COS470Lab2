The UN â€™s human rights chief says she is " alarmed " by the treatment of the independent media by several nations over the reporting of Covid 19 . 
Michelle Bachelet said on Friday that " restrictive measures " imposed on media as well as the " arrest and intimidation " of journalists , is hindering the free flow information , " vital in fighting Covid 19 . " 
" Some states have used the outbreak of the new coronavirus as a pretext to restrict information and stifle criticism , " Bachelet said . 
" A free media is always essential , but we have never depended on it more than we do during this pandemic , when so many people are isolated and fearing for their health and livelihoods . 
Credible , accurate reporting is a lifeline for all of us , " the statement says . 
Bachelet cites reports of violations against journalists in Asia Pacific , Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa . 
She said there are cases of journalists being threatened and even disappearing for voicing criticism of state response to the pandemic or for " simply questioning the accuracy of official numbers . " 
Concerns over treatment of the press : Earlier this week a leading media watchdog told CNN that the coronavirus pandemic could have been avoided had there been a free press in China . 
" Reporting the truth at the earliest possible moment would have allowed the rest of the world to react probably earlier and probably more seriously , " Reporters Without Borders ' Rebecca Vincent said . 
" The consequences ( of stifling media freedom ) are actually deadly . "
