Television stations across China will cut down entertainment programming , including popular variety show , to air more reports on the outbreak , according to a statement posted Tuesday by the National Radio and Television Administration . 
The move comes as the country steps up efforts to contain the spread of the virus . 
Speaking at a meeting with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Monday , China 's ambassador to the UN said the country has " full capability and confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic . " 
" Putting the interests of the people first , China has taken rapid and strong measures , putting in place a nationwide prevention and control mechanism , " Ambassador Zhang Jun said . 
" China has been working with the international community in the spirit of openness , transparency and scientific coordination . 
With a great sense of responsibility , China is sparing no effort in curbing the spread of disease and saving lives . 
Now is a crucial moment , and China has full capability and confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic . " 
Some 60 million people have been placed under travel restrictions in Hubei , the epicenter of the outbreak , with almost all movement in and out of Wuhan itself stopped and much of the city on lockdown . 
Officials have also cracked down on the trade of wild animals , after the Wuhan coronavirus was linked to a seafood market selling exotic live mammals , including bats and civet cats , which have previously been linked to the 2003 SARS outbreak .
