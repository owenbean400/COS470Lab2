The coronavirus outbreak , which began December 2019 in Wuhan , China , has now made its way across the world . 
So far its fatality rate appears to be lower than similar viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) , but researchers are still gathering data and racing to contain the virus . 
Let 's break it down : What is the virus ? 
The novel coronavirus ( 2019 n Co V ) detected in Wuhan belongs to a large family of viruses that mostly sicken animals -- but this coronavirus , like SARS , " jumped the species barrier " to infect people , the CDC said . 
What are the symptoms ? 
Coronavirus symptoms can look like a common cold -- they include a cough , fever , and trouble breathing . 
Severe cases can lead to pneumonia , kidney failure and even death . 
It can take a week after getting infected before showing any symptoms . 
How does it spread ? 
Scientists believe this coronavirus started in another animal and then spread to humans . 
Chinese officials say the disease can be transmitted through contact as well as water droplets -- for instance , if you touched something and the virus got on your hand , then you touched your eyes . 
How can I protect myself ? 
There 's no vaccine for the virus yet . 
To protect against it , avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms like coughing and sneezing . 
Wash your hands often with soap and water , cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze , wear a surgical mask , and disinfect surfaces you touch . 
How worried should I be ? 
The public should be cautious and take preventative measures , especially as it 's so early that researchers are still gathering information . 
But so far , the mortality rate is about 2-3 % -- lower than SARS at 10 % , or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome at 34 % .
