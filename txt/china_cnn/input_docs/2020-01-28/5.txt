By the end of day Monday , the number of confirmed cases of people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus in mainland China was 4,515 , according to China â€™s National Health Commission . 
The majority of confirmed cases are in Hubei province , which is where the virus was first identified . 
By the end of day Sunday , the number of cases in mainland China stood at 2,744 . 
That 's a jump in reported cases of nearly 65 % over the course of a day . 
During the 2002 and 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , there were 8,098 confirmed cases worldwide from November 2002 to July 2003 , with 774 deaths . 
While the current outbreak does not appear to be as deadly as SARS , it may be spreading more rapidly . 
That could be due to being more contagious , or the increased interconnectedness of both China and the world than in 2003 . 
As of mid March 2003 , roughly a month after the World Health Organization was first alerted to SARS by Chinese authorities , and three months after the first cases were detected in China , the number of confirmed cases worldwide stood at around 3,200 , with 159 confirmed deaths . 
Information release On Monday , the mayor of Wuhan admitted that people were " not satisfied " with the rate that his government released information on the coronavirus , adding that it was " not disclosed in a timely fashion . " 
Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state run CCTV that , " we did not effectively use that information " in its response . 
He explained that under Chinese law on infectious diseases , the local government first needs to report the outbreak to the national health department , and then get approval from the State Council -- the country 's chief administrative body , chaired by Premier Li Keqiang -- before they can make an announcement . 
The mayor added that he took responsibility for the " unprecedented " decision to lock down the city .
