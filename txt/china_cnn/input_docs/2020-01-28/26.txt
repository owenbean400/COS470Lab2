Hong Kong 's Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday that the government will " temporarily " close some of its borders with mainland China and travel permits to mainland Chinese tourists will stop being issued . 
Here 's why that 's a big deal . 
Legacy of SARS : Memories of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak of 2002 and 2003 run deep in Hong Kong , where 1,750 people were infected and more than 280 died of the disease . 
Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world , with ideal conditions for diseases to spread -- in tightly packed subway train carriages and people living cheek by jowl in the city 's notoriously tiny apartments . 
Initial suppression of information about the SARS outbreak after it was discovered in southern China heightened mistrust of the central Chinese government among many in Hong Kong . 
So it should therefore come as no surprise that the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan in December raised suspicions -- and fears -- in Hong Kong . 
Politically sensitive time : Hong Kong 's move to close some of its borders comes amid eight months of ongoing anti government protests that began against a now scrapped China extradition bill , which have expanded to include demands for greater autonomy in the semi autonomous city . 
So it 's a particularly sensitive time for Hong Kong 's beleaguered leader , Carrie Lam , with recent polls showing her popularity at an all time low in a divided city . 
However , calls to limit travel from mainland China came from lawmakers on both sides of Hong Kong 's political divide .
