World Health Organization Director General Dr . Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said today coronavirus has pandemic potential — but it ’s not there yet . 
Tedros said the decision to use the word pandemic is based on ongoing assessments of the geographic spread of the virus , severity and impact of the society and for the moment they are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus . 
He said the virus is affecting countries across the world in different ways and requires a tailored response , adding it ’s not a one size fits all response . 
WHO had previously declared Coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern . 
Remember : There is no precise , mathematical definition of a pandemic . 
Outbreaks get characterized as pandemics by epidemiologists — who are not yet using the term . 
That 's because they 've yet to see sustained transmission among people who have not recently traveled to China or had close contact with someone who recently traveled to China . 
It 's not enough for a cluster of disease in a country to exist and even spread — it has to spread in a sustained way , from person to person , time and time again , through many generations of transmission .
