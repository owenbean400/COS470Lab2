Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization said that that world should " jump on this thing super fast " , when asked by CNN if the rest of the world should adopt the all society approach used by the Chinese government . 
Aylward added that Chinese ’s response was broader than their containment efforts in Wuhan and Hubei , saying , " The danger is looking at Wuhan and Hubei and say [ ing ] okay that is the Chinese approach – because actually that is not . 
That ’s the exceptional part of the Chinese approach that is being applied in an area where you got community level transmission right through the whole place . " 
Aylward said countries should " isolate the contacts " and not let them " wander around and restart the transmission chains , " which is what China did . 
Aylward ’s exception , though , was that it was not necessary to lock down entire cities as China did . 
" So I think the big message is : You can control this particular respiratory virus by using these measures . 
You do not have to lock down cities is the big message from China in fact " , said Aylward .
