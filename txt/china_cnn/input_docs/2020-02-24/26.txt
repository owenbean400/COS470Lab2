China 's top political body approved the decision on Monday to ban the consumption and the illegal trade of wild animals , which some experts believe to be the source of the virus . 
The National People â€™s Congress Standing Committee approved the ban on Monday in a bid to help " safeguard public health and ecological security , " according to Chinese state media . 
The move aims to " completely ban the eating of wild animals " while also " cracking down on illegal trade of wildlife , " state media reports . 
The use of wild animals for scientific research , medicine and exhibition will now need to go through " strict examination and approval " by the supervising department in accordance with relevant regulations . 
This comes after Chinese authorities suspended the trade of wild animals on January 26th in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus .
