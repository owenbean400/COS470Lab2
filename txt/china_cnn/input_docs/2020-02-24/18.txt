Six Chinese provinces have lowered their coronavirus emergency response levels , according to local health commissions . 
Liaoning , a province in northeastern China that borders North Korea , was the first to downgrade the coronavirus emergency response level from the highest level -- Level 1 -- to Level 3 on Saturday , according to a statement by the provincial government . 
Shanxi , Guangdong , Yunnan , Gansu , and Guizhou provinces also downgraded their levels on Sunday and Monday . 
All previously had the highest response levels ; 
Shanxi and Guangdong lowered the response to Level 2 , while Yunnan , Guizhou , and Gansu provinces downgraded the response to Level 3 . 
What this means : China has a four tier emergency response system for natural disasters , accidents , public health emergencies , and social security incidents . 
The highest level mandates the State Council to lead the coordination work in response to the emergency . 
Lowering the emergency response levels will give local governments more autonomy and flexibility in implementing epidemic control efforts and resuming economic activities .
