Some healthy residents will gradually be allowed to leave the Chinese city of Wuhan , where the coronavirus outbreak began , officials said . 
Those who are stranded in Wuhan , which has been under strict lockdown since January 23 , will be able to leave if they have no symptoms of fever , cough , or asthma , according to a statement from the municipal government . 
However , they will need to exit at different times , and undertake 14 days of health monitoring and report to local health authorities once they arrive at their destination . 
Those under quarantine must remain . 
Wuhan residents stranded in other parts of the country may also enter the city after filing an application to the epidemic control department . 
The new policies will be implemented immediately .
