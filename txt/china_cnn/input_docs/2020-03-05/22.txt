The Chinese government has listed the whistleblower doctor who died of the coronavirus among a group of people who helped fight against the disease . 
Li Wenliang died in February , just months after trying to sound the alarm about the virus . 
Today , Li 's name is on a list of 506 healthcare and response workers published in a statement on the Chinese National Health Commission 's website , as " advanced individuals in the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in national health system . " 
Whistleblower punished : In December , as the virus was taking hold in Wuhan , Li was silenced and targeted by police after privately warning his classmates about its spread . 
He was made to sign a statement about his " misdemeanor " and " unlawful acts . " 
Li was later heralded by the public as a heroic whistleblower , as the government acknowledged the crisis and Li was able to speak more openly about it . 
However , Li contracted the virus , and died in February , sparking public fury and deep mistrust toward the government . 
In the days after his death , Chinese social media was flooded with calls for government accountability , an apology from Wuhan officials , and greater freedom of speech .
