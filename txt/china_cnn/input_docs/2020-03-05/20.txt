The US Department of Homeland Security refused entry into the country to 241 people -- 14 at airports ; 227 at land ports -- within the past month because of the novel coronavirus , according to data provided by the department . 
The figures provided by DHS were recorded from February 2 to March 3 . 
The department did not provide a breakdown by country for those who were refused entry at airports . 
Another 106 foreign nationals were denied entry before arriving in the US at pre clearance airports , where US Customs officials conduct screening overseas . 
The department is tasked with screening passengers that are subject to the President 's travel restrictions from China and Iran . 
At the beginning of February , the United States began implementing stringent travel restrictions in an effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak . 
Most foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days before their arrival to the United States are denied entry . 
That was expanded last week to include Iran .
