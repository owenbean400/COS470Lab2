Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly says a drop off in bookings began last week , and the airline may have to join competitors in cutting flights if it continues . 
He said the decision had not been made , but called it a " gut punch . " 
This is significant because Southwest is essentially only a domestic carrier â€“ so it is not seeing people who are disinterested in flying to China , but seeing people who do not want to fly around the US . 
Kelly said he does not think discounting prices would help , though it is something he could consider .
