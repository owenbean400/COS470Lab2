The Trump administration is expected to announce details Friday on plans to halt non essential travel on the US Mexico border in an effort to limit travel amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , according to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf . 
Wolf told reporters that more details on a southern border non essential closure will be announced later Friday . 
The expected action on the southern border appears similar to the one taken on the US border with Canada and marks the latest move by the administration to seal off the United States as coronavirus continues to spread . 
Some context : Over recent weeks , Trump has joined countries across the globe in introducing a slate of travel restrictions , which extend from China to Europe 's Schengen Area to the United Kingdom and Ireland , over coronavirus concerns . 
In a span of a few days , Trump has also moved to largely shutter the US land borders .
