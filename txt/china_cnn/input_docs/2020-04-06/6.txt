President Donald Trump announced the United States has reached an agreement with 3M that will see the company supply 55 million additional N95 respirator masks to the US each month . 
" Because of my actions under the ( Defense Production Act ) I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement — very amicable agreement with 3M — with the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high quality face masks each month , " Trump said during a Monday press conference . 
The agreement comes just days after Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to force the company 's hand . 
Under the deal , 3M will ship an additional 55 million masks per month to the US from its overseas factories for the next three months , a senior administration official said , which will help alleviate shortages in personal protective equipment for medical workers . 
The overwhelming majority of the masks will come from 3M 's Chinese factories , the official said . 
A senior administration official said the government 's decision to use the Defense Production Act was key to shifting the trajectory of negotiations between the two sides and forcing 3M 's hand .
