In mid March , when we strolled Shanghai ’s usually bustling West Bund park by the river , it was nearly deserted . 
The only people we saw were either the occasional local or expats walking their pets . 
You could sit on the grass and still keep a safe distance from your fellow visitors . 
But on Saturday , during the three day Qingming public holiday , every inch of the park was packed . 
There was so little space on the grass that some groups were hovering , picnic blankets ready , to claim their space . 
With the lure of spring weather and a day off , crowds walked shoulder to shoulder , far closer than the recommended six feet ( 1.8 meters ) of social distancing . 
Most people wore masks , but there were some who were daring enough to go barefaced . 
Walking through the area , we saw local families sharing a meal , groups of kids playing basketball and dogs weaving in and out of the crowds of people , chasing each other . 
On Nanjing Road , a popular shopping district which was deserted a month ago , customers flooded in and out of stores -- a happy sight for the Chinese government , which is desperate to get the country ’s economy humming again . 
But for me , the crowds brought mixed emotions . 
While it is nice to see people happy and celebrating that the worst of the outbreak may be behind them , part of me does worry just how safe it is . 
Can the epidemic really be over already ? 
Or are we witnessing the start of the next outbreak within the now walled off country ? 
How long can this freedom last ?
