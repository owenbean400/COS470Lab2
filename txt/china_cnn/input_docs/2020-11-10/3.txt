Chinese biotechnology firm Sinovac says that Brazil 's decision to halt clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine Corona Vac is not due to the vaccine itself . 
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman read the company 's statement to reporters when asked to comment on the development at the ministry 's daily press briefing Tuesday . 
The halted trials : Brazil 's health regulator suspended clinical trials of Corona Vac following a " serious adverse event " involving a volunteer recipient on October 29 , according to sources cited by CNN 's affiliate , CNN Brasil . 
The note from Brazil 's National Health Surveillance Agency did not elaborate on the specific nature of the event or where it took place , citing privacy concerns . 
Race for a vaccine : Sinovac 's Phase 3 trials began in late July , with an aim to recruit 130,000 volunteers .
