Brazil ’s National Health Surveillance Agency ( Anvisa ) has suspended phase 3 clinical trials of a Chinese developed Covid 19 vaccine following an " adverse " incident involving a volunteer recipient , according to sources cited by CNN ’s affiliate , CNN Brasil . 
Corona Vac , developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech , began phase 3 trials of Corona Vac in collaboration with the Brazilian Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo in late July . 
According to CNN Brasil , the studies were suspended due to the " occurrence of serious adverse event in one of the volunteers in Brazil . " 
No further details were provided owing to privacy regulations . 
The pause in testing marks a potential setback for one of China 's leading vaccine candidates and comes as US drugmaker Pfizer said Monday that early data from its own coronavirus vaccine showed more than 90 % effectiveness . 
In a note obtained by CNN Brasil , Anvisa mentions a case on October 29 for which the agency " determined the interruption of the clinical study , " adding that it " decided to interrupt the study to evaluate the data observed so far and judge on the risk/benefit of continuing the study . " 
" With the study interrupted , no new volunteers can be vaccinated , " reads the Anvisa note published by CNN Brasil late Monday . 
The Corona Vac trial vaccine uses inactivated virus cells to stimulate an immune response in patients . 
Testing began in late July , with 9,000 volunteers in five Brazilian states plus the capital . 
The Butantan Institute said it will hold a press conference Tuesday morning local time , according to CNN Brasil .
