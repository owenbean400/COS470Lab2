At the start of February , mainland Chinese authorities were reporting over 1,000 new coronavirus cases each day . 
This week , confirmed new coronavirus cases increased by the hundreds . 
On Friday , for instance , there were 427 new confirmed cases , with almost all of them in Hubei province where the outbreak is believed to have started , according to China â€™s National Health Commission . 
Since the start of the outbreak , 79,251 have been infected with coronavirus and 39,002 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital , the commission said . 
The recent numbers suggest that the outbreak may be stabilizing on the mainland . 
That 's how state media China Daily is presenting it -- in a report Saturday , the paper ran the headline : " Epidemic easing at its epicenter . " 
How China is reacting to the drop in numbers Some parts of China have lowered travel restrictions and began the slow process of getting back to work . 
Liaoning , a province in northeastern China that borders North Korea , was the first to downgrade the coronavirus emergency response level from the highest level -- Level 1 -- to Level 3 on Saturday , according to a statement by the provincial government . 
This was followed by Shanxi , Guangdong , Yunnan , Gansu and Guizhou , accounting for some 305 million people . 
Why that could be an issue The problem is , the danger may be far from over . 
Outside of the epicenter in Hubei province , where a huge amount of resources and emergency staff have been deployed , there are fears that cases may have been missed or gone undiagnosed . 
Similarly , it may be weeks before it is safe for people to begin moving around freely again or gathering in large numbers . 
We know that the virus can lie dormant and there is strong evidence that it is spread while people are asymptomatic .
