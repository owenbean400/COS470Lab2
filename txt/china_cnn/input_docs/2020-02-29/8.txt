North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced steps to prevent coronavirus from spreading into North Korea during a meeting with his Workers ' Party of Korea Saturday , according to state run KCNA . 
" In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country , it will entail serious consequences , " KNCA reported Kim as saying , " noting that the strong measures taken by our Party and the government from the beginning have been the surest and highly reliable , preemptive and decisive preventive measures as this viral infection spreads so rapidly , its incubation period is uncertain and its contagion route is also scientifically uncertain . " 
North Korea has not confirmed a single case of the virus inside its borders , but global health experts have warned the country is highly susceptible to an outbreak given its close proximity to China and limited medical capabilities . 
Every other country in East Asia has confirmed numerous cases . 
On Thursday , a United Nations sanctions committee announced it had given approval for diagnostic equipment to enter North Korea to combat a potential outbreak .
