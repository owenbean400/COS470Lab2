Marriott 's profits were slammed in the first quarter of this year , plunging about 92 % . 
The world 's biggest hotel chain on Monday reported net income of just $ 31 million from January to March compared to $ 375 million in the same period last year . 
Revenue per available room , an important industry metric that assesses a hotel 's ability to fill its rooms , fell 22.5 % throughout the quarter and as much as 90 % in April " as the pandemic moved around the world , " the company said . 
About a quarter of Marriott 's hotels worldwide are currently closed , mostly in Europe and the United States . 
But there was a " glimmer of good news , " said Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson . 
He told investors in a call that demand appears to be picking up , especially in Greater China , where bookings are coming in mostly from domestic travelers . 
Occupancy levels there have reached " just over 30 % , up from the lows of under 10 % in mid February , " Sorenson said . 
" In terms of hotel closings/openings , April seems to have defined the bottom , " the CEO added . 
" Most days , we 're seeing one or two or three more hotels reopen than we are seeing hotels closed . 
Marriott ( MAR ) shares are down almost 46 % this year . 
The company â€™s stock fell 5.6 % on Monday after earnings .
