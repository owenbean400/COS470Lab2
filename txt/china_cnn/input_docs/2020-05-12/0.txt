There was a surge of coronavirus cases over the weekend in some countries where stay at home measures and other restrictions were lifted , World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Monday . 
" In Wuhan , China , the first cluster of cases since their lockdown was lifted was identified , " Tedros said . 
" Germany has also reported an increase in cases since an easing of restrictions . 
Fortunately , all three countries have systems in place to detect and respond to a resurgence in cases . " 
Tedros said the WHO has released guidance and six criteria for countries to consider before lifting lockdown measures . 
" WHO is working closely with governments to ensure that key public health measures remain in place to deal with the challenge of lifting lockdowns , " he said . 
" Until there is a vaccine , the comprehensive package of measures is our most effective set of tools to tackle . "
