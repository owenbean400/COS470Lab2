Nearly 6 % of all hospitalized patients with Covid 19 work in health care and most in that group were nurses , according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
More than 4 % of health care workers who were hospitalized died . 
The CDC led Covid research team reviewed the charts of nearly 7,000 Covid 19 patients who were in the hospital between March 1 and May 31 . 
Most were women . 
A large proportion were Black . 
These patients skewed much younger than the general Covid 19 patient population . 
The median age of a health care professional who was hospitalized was 49 , compared to 62 for the country as a whole , the team reported in in the CDC â€™s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . 
Nearly 90 % of hospitalized health care professionals with Covid 19 had at least one underlying medical condition . 
The most common , reported at nearly 73 % , was obesity . 
In addition to infection prevention and control efforts , the CDC researchers said there is a need for prevention and management programs to help people control their weight . 
Obesity significantly increases the risk for severe Covid 19 illness . 
This research is in keeping with earlier studies . 
Research in China also found that people in nursing related occupations accounted for the most cases among the health care profession . 
Nurses may be most at risk of being exposed to the novel coronavirus because they have extended cumulative exposure time . 
Nurses have the most close and frequent contact with sick patients .
