China announced Wednesday that it would relax visa policies for some foreigners , in the latest sign of the government â€™s confidence in its containment of Covid 19 . 
Starting September 28 , foreign nationals holding three types of long term visas -- called residence permits -- are allowed to enter China without having to apply for a new visa , said the Chinese Foreign Ministry and National Immigration Administration in a notice posted online . 
The new rule covers people who hold visas for work , personal matters and family reunions . 
The latest policy , however , does not apply to China based foreign journalists , according to a Foreign Ministry official . 
China effectively closed its borders to most foreign nationals in late March as part of its effort to fight the spread of coronavirus . 
That month it suspended all previously issued visas for foreigners not already in the country . 
Eligible foreigners who enter China under the new rule " shall strictly abide by the Chinese regulations on epidemic prevention and control , " the notice added . 
" While ensuring effective epidemic control , the Chinese government will continue resuming people to people exchanges in a step by step and orderly manner . "
