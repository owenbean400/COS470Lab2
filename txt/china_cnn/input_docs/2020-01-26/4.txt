With global attention on the Wuhan coronavirus and its spread around China and other countries , it 's important to put it in the context of other deadly infections -- including seasonal influenza , which claims the lives of thousands of people every year . 
According to a September 2019 study by Chinese scientists published in The Lancet , there are about 88,100 influenza related deaths every year in China , with a mortality rate of between 1.6 % and 2.6 % . 
The majority of those who died as a result of the flu were aged over 60 , the report said . 
While the true extent of the new coronavirus is unclear , it appears to be more deadly than seasonal influenza . 
Of the 1,317 cases confirmed globally as of noon Saturday in China , there had been 41 deaths , a mortality rate of 3.1 % . 
However , that is far less deadly than related coronaviruses SARS and MERS . 
SARS has a mortality rate of about 10 % , while MERS killed 34 % of those infected . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates that this flu season -- from October 1 , 2019 until January 18 -- 15 to 21 million people have contracted the flu in the United States , killing somewhere between 8,200 to 20,000 people . 
Those numbers are based on the CDC â€™s weekly influenza surveillance reports , which summarize key influenza activity indicators .
