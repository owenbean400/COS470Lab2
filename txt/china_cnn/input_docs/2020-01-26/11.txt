With people rushing to buy face masks to protect themselves from the Wuhan coronavirus , China 's central government has asked manufacturers to interrupt their Lunar New Year holiday to resume production . 
The holiday is due to run until the end of January . 
However the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has asked factories to reopen , according to a report in Chinese state media . 
The decision was taken to " guarantee market supply " and " meet the needs of epidemic production and control , " according to the report . 
Thirty factories have now resumed production at a total output of 8 million masks per day , the Ministry is reported as saying .
