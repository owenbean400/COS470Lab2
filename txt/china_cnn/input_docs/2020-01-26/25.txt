The British government is " looking at all the options " to help citizens trapped in Wuhan , UK Home Secretary Priti Patel said Sunday after being asked about UK media reports that officials are examining the logistics of airlifting Britons out of the central Chinese city . 
During a Sky News interview , Patel said she would not " comment specifically on newspaper stories " but the UK is doing its " utmost to stop the virus from coming to the UK and obviously becoming a widespread problem . " 
Before China put in restrictions on outgoing flights from Wuhan , there were three flights a week into London â€™s Heathrow Airport , a Public Health England spokeswoman told CNN on Saturday .
