The United States ’ top infectious disease doctor wants a team of disease detectives from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to go to China and check on crucial questions about how the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading . 
But there ’s one problem : China first has to invite the CDC . 
" Up to now , to my knowledge , we have not been invited , " said Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health . 
A CDC spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on Sunday . 
NIH and CDC are separate divisions of the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
On Sunday , Ma Xiaowei , China ’s health minister , told reporters that the virus could spread before someone develops symptoms . 
If so , that means the virus will spread much more quickly than expected . 
Ma did not explain how Chinese authorities arrived at this conclusion . 
Fauci said that CDC disease detectives would need to see precisely how Chinese health authorities have gathered their data . 
" To my knowledge , we have not seen the precise minute , granular data and how they collected it , " he said . 
" We need to get to the real bottom line of how they collected their data and see if it ’s valid . " 
" The Chinese have good people . 
I do not want to impugn their capabilities , " Fauci added . 
" But when it ’s something as important as this , our people who are trained epidemiologists need to go over their data and the best way to do that is go there and see how they ’re collecting it . " 
He added that to his knowledge , the Chinese did not tell US health authorities that the virus could spread before someone is symptomatic , a crucial aspect of any disease investigation . 
He said he learned about it after reading a CNN reporter ’s email .
