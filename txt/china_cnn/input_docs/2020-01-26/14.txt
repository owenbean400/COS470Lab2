The images , videos and social media posts coming out from Wuhan -- ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak -- this weekend appear to paint a surreal picture of life in a city of 11 million people . 
Wuhan is located in central China and normally a gateway to the rest of the country . 
But the city has now been essentially closed off from the rest of the world , with almost no one allowed to enter or leave . 
Images show mostly empty streets on Saturday . 
Nearly all motor vehicles have been banned as of today to control the flow of people . 
Only vehicles with special permits , free shuttles and government vehicles are allowed to use the roads . 
Many stores throughout Wuhan have closed operations due to the epidemic -- including Starbucks , which closed all 90 of its branches in Hubei province , and Mc Donald 's . 
Images from grocery stores that are open show lines full of people in masks and empty shelves . 
Many people would have likely been stocking up before the weekend regardless of the coronavirus outbreak , because many shops in China would have closed for the Lunar New Year holiday . 
Chinese authorities have said the city has sufficient food supplies and there is no need to panic .
