North Korea is " increasing its number of guard posts " and " building a strong wall of defense at its borders " to stop coronavirus from entering the country , the state run Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday . 
The public has been instructed to take immediate actions for any small abnormalities , to disinfect products and to remove garbage from the sea in an effort to stop the virus , the report said . 
In addition , the report said the nation is " taking strong measures to root out any unhygienic or inappropriate conditions that could allow any room for transmission of the virus . " 
South Korea ’s spy agency told the parliamentary intelligence committee Friday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is making " unreasonable responses regarding Covid 19 prevention measures , " said Ha Tae keung , a member of the committee briefed by the agency . 
North Korea ’s borders have been shut since January after reports of Covid 19 emerged in China . 
The regime claims it has no confirmed cases of coronavirus but many experts are skeptical . 
According to the latest situation report released by the World Health Organization in early November , North Korea tested more than 12,000 samples for the coronavirus and received no positive results .
