Airlines operating in the United States will be required to ask all passengers booked on flights from outside the US if they â€™ve been to mainland China in last 14 days . 
The Transport Security Administration ( TSA ) will issue a new security directive to airlines from Sunday , according to a person briefed on the restrictions . 
Chinese nationals coming from China and connecting through another foreign airport will be denied travel . 
Those with pre clearance are exempted . 
There are also new directives that relate to US citizens . 
US citizens who have been to China in the last 14 days need to re book to one of seven gateway airports : John F . Kennedy International Airport in New York , Los Angeles International Airport , Seattle , San Francisco International Airport , Chicago , Atlanta and Honolulu . 
TSA notified airlines Saturday about the restrictions .
