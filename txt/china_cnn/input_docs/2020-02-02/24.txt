The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) announced it will begin enforcing restrictions for all passenger flights carrying individuals who have recently traveled from China in response to the coronavirus , according to a DHS press release that shed light on some of the procedures US air travelers can expect in the coming days The screening parameters reiterate much of what the Health and Human Services secretary previously announced go into effect at 5 p.m . ET today â€“ including that flights will be routed to seven designated US airports where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will seek to identify all potentially ill persons . 
DHS adds that Americans flying to the US from China will be re routed to the designated airports at no cost to the traveler , the DHS said . 
According to Acting DHS Secretary Chad F . Wolf , to minimize disruptions , Customs and Border Protection and air carriers are working to identify qualifying passengers before their scheduled flights . 
DHS advises if a traveler who spent time in China , outside the Hubei province , is re routed through one of the seven airports and shows no symptoms following a health screening , they will be re booked to their destination and asked to " self quarantine " at their homes . 
The department adds that any individual traveling from China who has either been in Hubei province or other areas of the mainland , and is showing virus symptoms , will be screened and subject to mandatory quarantine by medical professionals at a nearby facility . 
While the " overall risk to the American public remains low , " acting secretary Chad F . Wolf says " funneling all flights with passengers who have recently been in China is the most important and prudent step we can take at this time to decrease the strain on public health officials screening incoming travelers .
