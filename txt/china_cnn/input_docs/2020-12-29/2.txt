The European Union has called for the " immediate release " of Zhang Zhan , an independent Chinese journalist jailed for her role in documenting the early outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan , China . 
Zhang reported from Wuhan at the height of the initial coronavirus outbreak and has been jailed for four years by a Shanghai court after being found guilty of " picking quarrels and provoking trouble " , her lawyer said Monday . 
A former lawyer , Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to Wuhan in early February to report on the pandemic and subsequent attempts to contain it , just as the authorities began reining in state run and private Chinese media . 
For more than three months , she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents , from overflowing hospitals to empty shops . 
She posted her observations , photos and videos on Wechat , Twitter and You Tube -- the latter two of which are blocked in China . 
The EU has also called for the immediate release of " other detained and convicted human rights defenders â€¦ as well as all those who have engaged in reporting activities in the public interest . " 
According to Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) , China is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world and tightly controls the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall , its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus .
