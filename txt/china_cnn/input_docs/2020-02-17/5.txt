The number of Chinese tourists visiting South Korea has dropped significantly since the beginning of February , authorities in Seoul said . 
Health Minister Park Neung hoo told reporters Sunday that the number of daily visitors from mainland China has dropped from about 13,000 a day on February 2 to about 4,000 on Saturday . 
That 's a significant drop considering that in February 2019 , 453,000 Chinese nationals visited South Korea -- a daily average of nearly 16,200 . 
Why it matters : China is South Korea 's biggest source of visitors , and there are concerns a drop in Chinese arrivals could exacerbate any negative effects the epidemic may have on the South Korean economy . 
Hong Nam ki , the country 's minister of economy and finance , said Monday that the government plans to help the domestic tourism industry by lending $ 253 million to budget airlines and providing $ 50 million worth of no collateral , low interest rate loans for small and medium sized tour companies .
