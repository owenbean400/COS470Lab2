Police in Hong Kong have arrested two men and are searching for a third after the group stole about 600 toilet paper rolls , in a robbery likely sparked by coronavirus fears that have gripped the city . 
Early Monday morning , a delivery worker was transporting goods to a supermarket in the city 's Mong Kok district . 
He had placed about 50 packs of toilet rolls , containing about 600 rolls , outside the supermarket when three men stole them , police said . 
Several hours later , police found the stolen toilet rolls in a nearby guesthouse , and arrested two of the men . 
They are investigating the incident as a robbery , and are still looking for the third suspect . 
Why are people stealing toilet rolls ? 
Earlier this month , the Hong Kong government announced it would close some borders with mainland China -- sparking unsubstantiated rumors that supply chains from China would be cut off . 
The city government denied the rumors and tried to reassure the public -- but to no avail . 
Residents rushed to supermarkets to load up on supposedly endangered goods such as toilet paper rolls , rice , hand sanitizer , and other cleaning products . 
Soon , supermarkets sold out entirely of toilet rolls , food staples , and other crucial goods ; photos inside supermarkets showed barren shelves and empty aisles . 
People are scared and angry : The toilet roll crisis sparked controversy in Hong Kong . 
After photos circulated on social media of residents hoarding multiple packs , some accused the panic buyers of unnecessarily creating chaos and confusion .
