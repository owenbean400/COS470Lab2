Malaysia will not allow any people who were on board the Westerdam cruise liner to enter its borders after one of the ship 's passengers entered the country and then tested positive for the virus . 
The patient , an 83 year old American woman , and her husband were both found to have symptoms when they landed in Kuala Lumpur after flying in from Cambodia , Malaysia 's Health Ministry said in a statement . 
The husband tested negative . 
Search for port : The Westerdam spent days at sea looking for a port that would allow the ship to dock . 
Several governments feared passengers on the Westerdam could have been infected with the coronavirus because the ship had docked in Hong Kong . 
The Cambodian government allowed the ship to dock late last week , and the 1,455 passengers were allowed to return to their respective countries after they successfully passed through health screenings . 
Malaysia on alert : The infected patient and her husband were among 145 people who had flown into Kuala Lumpur from Cambodia , Malaysian authorities said . 
Six passengers are still in the country awaiting their outbound flights -- authorities said they will be tested for the virus and if the results are negative , they will be allowed to continue their journeys . 
The Malaysian government has announced several other measures including barring cruise ships that originated or transited in China from entering Malaysia and suspending the remaining Westerdam passengers in Cambodia from entering Malaysia on the three remaining charter flights . 
As of February 16 , Malaysia has 22 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus . 
Eight of them have been discharged from the hospital .
