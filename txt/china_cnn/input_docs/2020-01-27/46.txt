Set within a protected area of the picturesque Sai Kung Country Park , the 13.2 hectare Lady Mac Lehose Holiday Village is known for its greenery and tranquility . 
Since the early 1980s Hong Kongers have come to the holiday village to get away from the bustling city and enjoy its camping facilities and outdoor activities . 
But since January 23 , the holiday camp has been turned into a quarantine center to house those who have came into close contact with confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hong Kong . 
A check point has been set up at the entrance of the village and police monitor those going in and out . 
According to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department , the Lady Mac Lehose Holiday Village can accommodate 268 residential campers and has 52 standalone bungalows . 
The Hong Kong government has also turned the Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village on Hong Kong island into a quarantine center and plans to do the same with a third facility . 
" To cope with the quarantine need in future , the DH ( Department of Health ) is contacting holiday villages under other non governmental organizations as potential sites of quarantine centers , " a government statement said Sunday . 
However , there were protests in the northern Hong Kong town of Fanling -- near the Chinese border -- after it was announced that an unoccupied apartment building there would be converted to a " temporary " quarantine center . 
Residents set up roadblocks and clashed with police , and on Sunday the authorities said they were abandoning the plan . 
Hong Kong authorities said residents of Hubei , the province of which Wuhan is the capital , and people who have visited the region in the last 14 days , will not be able to enter the city . 
The order does not cover Hong Kong residents , though they may be placed under quarantine . 
Hong Kong has eight confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus .
