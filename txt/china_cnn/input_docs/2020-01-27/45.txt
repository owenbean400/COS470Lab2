Scientists at Imperial College London have estimated that each person infected with the Wuhan coronavirus has gone on to infect two to three people , according to a report released Saturday . 
" We estimate that , on average , each case infected 2.6 ( uncertainty range : 1.5-3.5 ) other people up to January 18 , 2020 , based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modeling of potential epidemic trajectories , " said the report . 
" This implies that control measures need to block well over 60 % of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak , " it added . 
When it comes to outbreaks , scientists and public health experts are concerned with how quickly a disease can spread and its mortality rate . 
But there is still a lot more to learn about the virus , and scientists have warned against alarmism . 
" It is quite easy to get fixed on a particular number but such predicted numbers will vary considerably at this early stage in an epidemic , " Mike Turner , Director of Science , The Wellcome Trust , said in a statement . 
" This makes it more difficult to put in place effective control measures . 
A lot of people are working furiously to try and control this epidemic . " 
On Sunday , Chinese officials said people can spread the virus before they have symptoms .
