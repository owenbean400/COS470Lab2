China is worried about migrant workers who went home to visit family during the Lunar New Year , according to a health expert speaking at the National Health Commission Monday . 
The rural population is also of particular concern as those living in rural areas did not have as much experience in dealing with outbreak prevention as the urban populations did during the 2002-2003 severe respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak . 
SARS is also a type of coronavirus , which causes flu like symptoms , and can mutate as it spreads from person to person . 
Between November 2002 and July 2003 , SARS infected over 8,000 people and killed 774 around the world . 
Around 40 % of China 's population live in rural areas , according to Chinese state media Xinhua . 
The country also has a sustained wave of migrant workers moving from rural to urban areas for employment , with millions making the switch every year .
