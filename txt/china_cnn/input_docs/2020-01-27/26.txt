Chinese health officials said Sunday that the coronavirus can be spread before any symptoms appear , meaning carriers may not realize they are infected before they transmit the virus to others . 
There 's still lots we do not know about this outbreak , however , and according to Dr . Yvonne Doyle , medical director of Public Health England , " it is not confirmed that people are infectious before they appear to be ill . " 
" That 's one of the things we have to learn , " she added . 
Here 's an excerpt ( lightly edited for clarity ) of Dr . Doyle 's interview with BBC Radio 4 's Today Program on Monday : Q : ( We 're ) hearing from China that people can spread the virus without having any symptoms ... 
A : At the moment we do not have confirmed evidence that that â€™s the case . 
It 's reasonable of course to assume that could happen , but at the moment we do not know that , because this is a novel virus . 
Q : Do you think it is likely that we are going to see cases ( in the UK ) ? 
A : Yes I do ... 
I think I would be surprised if there was not . 
We are well prepared since we spotted this in the early new year . 
We have been working with increasing intensity with the NHS ( National Health Service ) to make sure we are well prepared , and we are . 
Q : ( We 're ) also hearing Chinese officials are also developing a vaccine , will that be ready in time ? 
A : It wo not be ready in time at the moment . 
Vaccines take months , maybe years to develop .
