The death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus now stands at 80 , with almost 2,800 cases confirmed across China , as the country initiates emergency procedures to try and rein in the pathogen 's global spread . 
Making that task more difficult is the fact that the virus can be spread before any symptoms appear , Chinese health authorities said Sunday , meaning carriers may not realize they are infected before they transmit the virus to others . 
Across China , 15 cities with a combined population of over 57 million people -- more than the entire population of South Korea -- have been placed under full or partial lockdown . 
Wuhan itself has been effectively quarantined , with all routes in and out of the city closed or highly regulated . 
The government announced it is sending an additional 1,200 health workers -- along with 135 People 's Liberation Army medical personnel -- to help the city 's stretched hospital staff . 
Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang said Sunday the number of cases could rise by another thousand . 
The disease has also spread widely across China , with almost 70 cases confirmed in the capital Beijing , including a nine month old girl -- the youngest known case to be confirmed so far .
