Coronavirus patients with high blood pressure are twice as likely to die from the infection , a new international study found . 
High blood pressure has been known to worsen the risk of serious symptoms , but the study -- published in the European Heart Journal -- shows just how bad the risk is . 
The international team of researchers , led by Fei Li and Ling Tao of the department of cardiology at Xijing Hospital in Xi 'an , China , studied the records of 2,866 patients treated in Wuhan , where the coronavirus outbreak emerged . 
Just under 30 % of them had high blood pressure . 
The team found that 4 % of patients with high blood pressure died , compared to 1.1 % of those without high blood pressure . 
After some adjustments for differences among the patients , that worked out to a doubled risk of dying for the patients with high blood pressure . 
And 7.9 % of patients who had stopped taking their blood pressure medications died .
