The higher coronavirus death rate for ethnic minority groups in England and Wales could be due to socio economic factors , according to the UK 's Office for National Statistics ( ONS . ) The divide is most stark for men from Black African backgrounds , who die at a rate 3.8 times higher than White counterparts , while the rate for women of Black African ethnicity is 2.9 times higher . 
These rates drop slightly when researchers accounted for geography , socio economic characteristics and health measures , including pre existing conditions . 
But the rate for Black African men remained 2.5 times higher than White peers , while the rate for women was 2.1 times higher . 
" All ethnic groups other than Chinese females were at higher risk of Covid 19 mortality than the White ethnic population , " the ONS found . 
The divide was " most strongly associated with demographic and socio economic factors " and could not be explained by " pre existing health conditions . " 
The trend has been covered in multiple reports and inquiries and the UK government remains under pressure to address the issue . 
He added that the difference in risk of death was partially explained by " demographic , geographical and socioeconomic factors , such as where you live or the occupation you â€™re in . " 
" It also found that although specific pre existing conditions place people at greater risk of Covid 19 mortality generally , it does not explain the remaining ethnic background differences in mortality . "
