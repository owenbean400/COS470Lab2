On Wednesday , China reported far fewer cases of the novel coronavirus than it did the day before , signaling that the spread of the virus could be slowing . 
But the numbers were back up yesterday with China announcing a major jump in both new deaths and new cases . 
There are many reasons we ’re seeing this phenomenon , including variances in the incubation period and more people seeking treatment . 
But one of the top reasons for the variation in numbers is the constantly changing definitions of what constitutes a case in China : Is it just when someone has a lab confirmed test ? 
Is it when they exhibit symptoms indicative of infection ? 
Should someone who is asymptotic be counted ? 
The spike is partly due to a broader definition of what constitutes a confirmed case , to include people diagnosed on the basis of their symptoms rather than testing positive . 
Keep in mind : This is normal . 
" It ’s normal during the course of an outbreak to adapt the case definition , " Dr . Sylvie Briand , director of the World Health Organization 's Infectious Hazards Management Department , said during a news conference yesterday . 
Here 's a look at reported cases , according to World Health Organization data . 
Remember : These totals may differ from those reported by Chinese health officials , who report updated totals at different times than the WHO .
