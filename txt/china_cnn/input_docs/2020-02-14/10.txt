Economies across China are suffering from the outbreak of novel coronavirus , which has shut down cities and left workers stuck at home for days or weeks . 
In the Chinese special administrative region of Macao -- the world 's biggest gambling center -- the government has announced it would hand out $ 275 million in vouchers to help try to boost the economy during the outbreak . 
In a statement Thursday , the Macao government called on its citizens to spend up by sending every resident a $ 374 electronic voucher which can only be used in a three month period . 
It will also provide a $ 75 healthcare voucher for every Macao permanent resident , as well as discussing further tax cuts and housing subsidies . 
Casinos hit : The virus has had a devastating impact on tourism in the gambling enclave , which relies heavily on mainland Chinese visitors . 
Gambling is illegal on the mainland and Lunar New Year is usually a particularly busy time for Macao 's casinos . 
But not this year -- tourism to Macao had dropped 73.6 % year on year , the local government announced on January 29 . 
A total of 41 entertainment operations in the semiautonomous Chinese city were suspended for 15 days on February 4 , according to the government . 
They include casinos , betting branches , theaters , cinemas , game centers , internet cafes , discos , bars , nightclubs and dance halls .
