In a news release published on Friday , the Tourism Board said the daily average number of visitors in January was 100,000 , down from a 200,000 daily average prior to the start of last year â€™s political protests . 
The statement added that the " Mainland ( Chinese ) and short haul markets were the most affected , recording a drop of over 50 % . " 
The Tourism Board said " the outbreak of COVID 19 ( novel coronavirus ) aggravated the declines , as some airlines have suspended flights to Hong Kong " while the government 's implementation " of measures restricting the flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland " also impacted cross border visitor figures . 
The Tourism Board added that " Preliminary data in February suggests that the arrivals have continued to decline , with average daily arrivals falling below 3,000 , of which 75 % were non Mainland visitors . " 
Throughout January and February the Hong Kong government implemented a series of travel restrictions with mainland China which included partially closing the border and mandating that all travelers arriving from mainland China undergo a mandatory 14 day quarantine .
