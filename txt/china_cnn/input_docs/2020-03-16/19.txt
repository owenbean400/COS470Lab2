Children in China infected with novel coronavirus showed less severe symptoms than adults , though infants and toddlers were vulnerable to moderate and severe infection , according to a new study published online in the medical journal Pediatrics on Monday . 
The study examined 731 confirmed and 1,412 suspected cases of COVID 19 in children . 
Out of the combined 2,143 cases , one child , a 14 year old boy , died and nearly 6 % of cases were severe , compared with 18.5 % of adults experiencing severe symptoms . 
Young children , particularly infants , were vulnerable to COVID 19 infection , the authors of the study said . 
Nearly 11 % of cases were severe and critical for infants less than 1 year old . 
More than 90 % of all pediatric patients were asymptomatic , showing mild or common forms of illness . 
About 13 % of patients who tested positive for the virus did not show symptoms of illness . 
Researchers remain unsure why children with COVID 19 were not as ill as adults .
