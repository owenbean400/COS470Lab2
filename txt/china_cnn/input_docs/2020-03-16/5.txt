The US Peace Corps has decided to temporarily suspend all operations around the world and evacuate its volunteers as the coronavirus pandemic spreads . 
The Peace Corps had already evacuated volunteers from China and Mongolia following the outbreak at the beginning of the year . 
Peace Corps director Jody Olsen said in the statement that she understood the evacuations would be " difficult , emotionally draining " experiences . 
Since 1961 , the Peace Corps have sent volunteers from the US to more than 141 countries worldwide to provide technical assistance on social and development projects .
