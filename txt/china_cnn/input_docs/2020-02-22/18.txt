Israel expanded its restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals to include anyone who has been in South Korea and Japan in the last 14 days , the Health Ministry announced Saturday afternoon . 
A Korean Air flight from South Korea landed at Tel Aviv 's Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening . 
Only 12 Israelis were allowed off the plane and were immediately taken to their homes , the ministry said . 
Approximately 200 foreign nationals were not allowed off the plane . 
Instead , the plane was refueled and sent back to its origin . 
Last week , Israel announced that any foreign national who had been in Thailand , Singapore , Macau , or Hong Kong in the previous 14 days would be denied entry . 
Israel has already barred foreigners who have recently traveled through China from entering the country . 
Earlier Saturday , the Health Ministry warned that nine South Korean tourists who had been part of a tour group in Israel were diagnosed with coronavirus upon returning to South Korea . 
Anyone who came into close contact with the tourists for an extended period of time was instructed to self quarantine . 
Already , 20 workers of Israel 's Natural Parks Authority who encountered the tour group will self quarantine until at least Wednesday , the ministry said . 
A class of 30 students and two teachers who came into contact with the tour group will self quarantine until Thursday . 
Another teacher is already being tested at Soroka hospital in Tel Aviv . 
Late Saturday , the ministry announced that another group of 60 students and 6 adults , including teachers and security guards , would self quarantine , after coming into contact with the South Korean tourists .
