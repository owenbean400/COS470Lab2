There ’s great concern about the spread of the novel coronavirus in countries outside China and among people with no connection to China or Wuhan , World Health Organization ( WHO ) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday . 
There ’s still a chance to contain the virus , Tedros said , " but the window of opportunity is narrowing . " 
The WHO is calling on countries to continue containment measures while preparing for community transmission , he said . 
He said China ’s containment measures in Wuhan and elsewhere are " hammering " the virus and can help contain it . 
The outbreak can still go any direction , Tedros said , and countries need to prepare for any eventuality . 
Dr . Sylvie Briand , director of the WHO 's Infectious Hazards Management Department , said the agency is working to prepare countries ’ health care workers with training and making sure they know how to protect themselves , and to make sure countries have enough workers to handle a number of cases .
