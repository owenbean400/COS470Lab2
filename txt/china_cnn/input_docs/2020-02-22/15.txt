Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN he thinks " we are clearly at the brink " of a coronavirus pandemic . 
In an interview with CNN 's Michael Smerconish on Saturday , the nation 's top infectious disease doctor said : " Our fate is going to be determined by the ability of countries outside of China that have travel related cases . 
And now they 're starting to develop sustained transmission from person to person to person . " 
" And if you have multiple countries like that , then the horse is out the barn . 
And it 's going to be very difficult to prevent more cases from coming here to our own country . " 
Fauci said , however , that the risk to the US is still " very low , " but warned that could " change rapidly . " 
He also said evacuating Americans off the Diamond Princess cruise ship was a " difficult decision , " but he believed it was " without a doubt the correct decision . "
