The bubble will allow residents of both places to travel back and forth without undergoing quarantine or restrictive control measures . 
Open travel in both the Chinese city and the Southeast Asian country has been suspended for months .

Currently , those who are allowed to enter either city must quarantine for 14 days after arrival . 
The bubble was announced last month .
