Patients hospitalized with Covid 19 , especially in an intensive care unit , may suffer higher rates of acute kidney injury than previously thought , according to new research . 
More than a third of patients treated at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center during the height of the outbreak there developed acute kidney injury , the researchers reported . 
And 78 % of those admitted to an intensive care unit had kidney injury , Ruijun Chen of Columbia University and colleagues reported in the BMJ . 
They said nearly 14 % of those admitted to hospital and 35.2 % of those in intensive care needed inpatient dialysis treatment . 
That is a higher percentage than seen in similar studies in China and Seattle , the researchers said . 
Chen ’s team looked at the first 1,000 Covid 19 patients who either went to the emergency department or were admitted to the hospital between March 1 and April 5 . 
Patients with kidney damage can need intensive dialysis and may develop blood clotting . 
There could be a variety of reasons for the injuries , Chen ’s team said . 
Sometimes doctors limit delivery of fluids when treating these patients , and that could damage the kidneys , they said . 
The virus could directly attack the kidneys , also . 
Plus many of the patients with severe coronavirus infections had other health problems , including high blood pressure , diabetes or pre existing kidney disease .
