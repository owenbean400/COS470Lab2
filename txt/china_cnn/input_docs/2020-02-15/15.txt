Another 67 people onboard the Diamond Princess have tested positive for novel coronavirus , Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Saturday -- bringing the number of cases from the ship to 286 . 
More than 3,600 people , including 428 Americans , have been stuck on the cruise ship , which became a floating quarantine zone after dozens of people tested positive for the coronavirus . 
Elsewhere in Japan , there are 39 confirmed cases of the virus , bringing the country 's total to 325 -- the highest number of cases outside of mainland China . 
One Japanese woman in her 80s , not from the ship , has died . 
The Health Ministry did not report any new cases on Friday . 
Disembarking : Passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship will be disembarked over several days beginning February 21 , said the president for the cruise operator . 
Crew on board will likely begin their own quarantine once all passengers have left the ship , said Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz in a letter read to passengers by the ship â€™s captain . 
This does not apply to the Americans taking the US government evacuation charter flight on Sunday . 
Delay on testing : According to Swartz , the Japanese government said they may start a new testing process starting February 18 -- which may push back the disembarkation . 
The quarantine originally was set to lift on February 19 . 
" We understand there is a limit to the number of tests the Japanese government can complete each day , so testing all of our remaining guests could take a few days to complete , " Swartz said . 
Because each test takes several days to process results , the first guests would not disembark until February 21 .
