Two Hmong men in the United States say they faced discrimination in Indiana , sparked by fear of the coronavirus , while they were looking for a hotel room . 
Kao Lor and his uncle Lee Lor , members of the Hmong Asian ethnic group , tried to get a room at a Super 8 Motel in the northern Indiana city of Plymouth -- but after they entered , an employee asked if they was Chinese , Kao Lor said . 
Lor began recording the encounter , capturing the male employee repeating the question . 
" If you are from China , I need to know , " the employee said , later adding it was company policy that " anyone from China has be picked up and quarantined for two weeks . " 
Eventually Lor and his uncle decided to try another hotel . 
Then , it happened again -- at a Days Inn , Lor recorded a hotel employee who seemed to acknowledge Asians are not being allowed because of the virus . 
" Deeply troubled " : Wyndham Hotels , which franchises both the Days Inn and Super 8 brands , told CNN in a statement they were " deeply troubled by these incidents as they 're not reflective of our values or our expectations of franchisees . " 
Wyndham said they were " addressing with the owners of both hotels " and working to reach out to the Lors .
