All international flights to Beijing will be diverted to other cities in China starting Monday , amid growing concerns over imported cases of novel coronavirus . 
Passengers on affected flights will need to clear immigration and customs at their first port of entry . 
Those deemed healthy will then be allowed to board the same aircraft to fly onwards to Beijing , the government announced Sunday . 
These rules had already been applied to some Beijing bound international flights last week , with planes diverted to three nearby cities . 
Now that policy has been rolled out wider , 12 cities , including Shanghai , have been identified to handle the diverted traffic . 
The bigger picture : Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , has not reported any new cases for four days in a row . 
But now Beijing has a new focus in its fight against coronavirus : people bringing the virus into China . 
China recorded 46 new coronavirus cases on Saturday -- and all but one came from abroad . 
That brings the total number of imported cases to 314 .
