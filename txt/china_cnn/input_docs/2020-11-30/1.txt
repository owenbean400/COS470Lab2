Moderna ’s ability to assemble its coronavirus vaccine just days after receiving the genetic sequence of the virus from China does not indicate it ’s any less safe or effective than vaccines made using slower technology , Moderna chairman Noubar Afeyan said during an interview with CNN Monday . 
Moderna ’s vaccine was made using a " platform " that was designed over many years , with all the structure ready to go when the pandemic hit . 
All that was needed was a genetic sequence from the virus doctors wanted to protect against . 
Afeyan also said the testing the company has done in partnership with the US federal government and academic centers in the last 10 months is as rigorous , if not more , than most other vaccines that have developed . 
" There is a sentiment out there that if you go fast , you must be taking corners . 
At least in our case , and I believe in everyone 's case , that 's simply not the case , " Afeyan said .
