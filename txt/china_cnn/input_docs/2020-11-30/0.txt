Kim Jong Un appears to have kicked North Korea 's pandemic prevention plan into overdrive , further tightening the country 's nearly impassible borders , cutting off nearly all trade with China , and even allegedly executing a customs official for failing to handle imported goods appropriately . 
Beijing exported just $ 253,000 worth of goods to Pyongyang in October -- a drop of 99 % from September to October , according to data published by China 's customs administration . 
For context , that 's less in terms of dollar value than China exported to Liechtenstein and Monaco during October . 
Why that matters : China is North Korea 's biggest trading partner and effectively the Kim regime 's economic lifeline -- the country basically does not import significantly from anywhere else . 
Taking Covid seriously : The new customs figures , if accurate , show that Kim appears to be willing to pare back -- or even cut off -- trade with China to prevent the virus from entering North Korea , even if it means risking the country 's food and fuel supply . 
Alleged executions : North Korea has not publicly acknowledged the drop in trade , or the reason behind it , but the pandemic is the most likely explanation . 
Kim reportedly had two people executed for Covid 19 related crimes , including a customs official who did not follow virus prevention rules while importing goods from China . 
CNN has not been able to independently confirm news of the execution , nor have North Korean officials publicly confirmed it . 
Other extreme measures : North Korean state media reported Sunday that authorities were enacting new , stricter anti epidemic measures across the country , including increasing the number of guard posts at border crossings and tightening the rules of sea entry in coastal areas . 
Authorities have even been ordered to " incinerate seaborne rubbish . "
