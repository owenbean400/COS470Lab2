Cherry blossoms are heading into full bloom in Wuhan -- ground zero of the Covid 19 outbreak . 
Wuhan used to be known as a city of blossom , an economic engine of the central heartland , and the birthplace of a century old revolution that brought down the country 's last imperial dynasty . 
Now , the metropolis of approximately 11 million people in Hubei province has become the face of the coronavirus outbreak -- a stigma the people of Wuhan are increasingly unable to shake off . 
China 's rate of new infections has now slowed significantly , with no new locally transmitted cases reported . 
The blossom looks almost more beautiful as it blooms on a deserted university campus -- reflecting the signs of hope at the original epicenter of the pandemic .
