The coronavirus pandemic has dramatically altered daily life around the globe . 
Stores are shut , streets quiet , restaurants closed , face masks ubiquitous , and supermarket aisles empty . 
Phrases like social distancing and self isolation have made their way into the public consciousness . 
In some places , like Thailand 's capital Bangkok , people diligently follow the rules of social distancing -- even sitting feet apart from each other in neat grids in mall food courts . 
In other places like Japan , where the popular cherry blossom season is underway , social distancing does not appear to have taken hold yet . 
There were similar scenes in the United States , where more than a dozen states have imposed stay at home orders . 
Last weekend , crowds gathered on beaches , hiking trails , and parks in California , in open defiance of the state wide order to shelter in place and avoid close contact with others . 
Meanwhile , in places like mainland China , coronavirus case numbers continue to drop every day -- leading to a cautious easing of travel restrictions and strict lockdowns . 
Businesses in China are returning to work , and even tourist sites are reopening -- the Badaling section of the Great Wall is finally open again this week , after being closed for two months .
