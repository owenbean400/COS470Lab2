The per capita number of coronavirus cases in the US is almost four times that of China , based on most recent population estimates . 
Based on CNN 's count Thursday evening , the US now has 81,836 cases for a country with an estimated population of just over 328 million . 
That 's about one case for every 4,010 people . 
China 's number is similar , 81,782 , but for a country four times larger in population . 
Current United Nations estimates put China 's population at over 1.4 billion . 
That 's about one case for every 17,582 people . 
China typically reports new nationwide case totals around 9 p.m . ET , so the comparison could soon change .
