There are now 25 sailors who have tested positive for coronavirus aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , a Navy official has confirmed to CNN . 
The Navy says they expect there to be additional positive tests among the crew , with one official telling CNN there could possibly be " dozens " of new cases that emerge . 
A second official said if there is a large number of additional cases , the Defense Department would be unlikely to publicly specify how many of the Navy â€™s overall cases are members of the crew , out of concerns that adversaries China or North Korea could see the ship as vulnerable . 
Despite the outbreak , Chief of Naval Operations Adm . Mike Gilday said in a statement , " We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region . " 
Earlier in the day , acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had said there were " several " more cases onboard the ship , but did not give a specific number . 
There are approximately 5,000 personnel onboard the carrier . 
Some context : The Roosevelt is in the process of pulling into Guam , according to Modly . 
" No one on the crew will be allowed to leave anywhere into Guam , other than on pier side , " he said . 
The ship was last in port in Vietnam more than two weeks ago . 
It is not clear where the sailors initially contracted the virus . 
The Navy is now in the process of flying all personnel off the ship .
