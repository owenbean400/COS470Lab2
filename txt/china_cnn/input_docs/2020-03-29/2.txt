Domestic flights will resume in Hubei province , except in the city of Wuhan , from Sunday midnight local time , according to a statement from the Civil Aviation Administration of China . 
Cargo flights will resume as well as passenger flights . 
The Chinese government has been steadily reducing the restrictions on Hubei and other previously heavily affected provinces , as the number of coronavirus cases has continued to fall . 
Today China reported 45 new cases , all but one of which came from outside the country . 
Flights to and from Wuhan , the original epicenter of the virus , will resume at midnight on April 8 when the city â€™s lockdown is expected to be lifted .
