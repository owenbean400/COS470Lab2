The local epidemic transmission of the novel coronavirus in China is " basically blocked , " National Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said on Sunday . 
The current number of confirmed cases in the country dropped to fewer than 3,000 on March 28 , therefore local transmission has been blocked , Feng said at a press conference . 
However , he added that the possibility of a new wave of transmission from imported cases remains high , as there are 693 confirmed imported cases from 42 countries . 
Here 's some background : China is closing its border to most foreigners amid fears of imported novel coronavirus cases causing a second outbreak in the country where the infection was first detected . 
In a statement last week , the government said that " in view of the rapid spread of Covid 19 across the world , China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into China by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits " as of March 28 .
