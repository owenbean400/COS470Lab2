While much of the world scrambles to prevent new coronavirus cases from stalling the fragile recovery from recession , China 's economy is hitting its stride again and will end the year more influential than ever . 
The world 's second largest economy was the only major world power to avoid a recession this year as Covid 19 forced lockdowns and crippled businesses . 
China 's GDP is expected to grow 1.6 % this year , while the global economy as a whole will contract 5.2 % , according to summer projections from the World Bank . 
China built its relatively quick recovery through several measures , including stringent lockdown and population tracking policies intended to contain the virus . 
The government also set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for major infrastructure projects , and offered cash incentives to stimulate spending among its populace . 
The payoff has been evident , as tourism and spending rebounded during last week 's busy Golden Week holiday period . 
By the end of the year , China 's share of global GDP is likely to rise by about 1.1 percentage points , according to a CNN Business calculation using World Bank data . 
That 's more than triple the share it gained in 2019 . 
By contrast , the United States and Europe will see their shares dip slightly . 
All told , China 's economy is expected to be worth about $ 14.6 trillion by the end of 2020 , roughly equivalent to 17.5 % of global GDP .
