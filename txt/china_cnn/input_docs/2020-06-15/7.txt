A Chinese company says its experimental coronavirus vaccine caused the body to produce antibodies against the virus . 
Sinovac Biotech Ltd . is testing the vaccine in more than 700 volunteers in an accelerated trial that combines Phase 1 safety testing and the next step , Phase 2 . 
" The phase II clinical trial results show that the vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies 14 days after the vaccination , " the company said in a statement . 
No one has been able to show if these neutralizing antibodies can protect people against infection with Covid 19 , but vaccine makers hope they will . 
More than 90 % of the 600 volunteers in the Phase 2 arm developed these antibodies , the company said in a statement . 
" Sinovac is collaborating with Instituto Butantan in Brazil to prepare and conduct a phase III clinical study , " it added . 
Phase 3 testing is the last step to test whether a vaccine or drug works before seeking approval from regulators . 
How it works : Sinovac is using an old fashioned approach to making a coronavirus vaccine , one that that uses an entire virus to prompt the body to develop immunity . 
The virus is inactivated so it cannot cause disease . 
This whole virus approach is slower because batches of virus must be grown in factories to make large amounts of vaccine , but it is effective . 
Whole virus vaccines still in use include polio shots , flu shots and the rabies vaccine . 
The US is pushing ahead with newer vaccines made using genetic material from the virus . 
They are faster to make but scientists have to figure out which part of the virus is the best part to replicate in order to induce an strong immune response .
