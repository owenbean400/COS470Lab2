All foreigners and Chinese nationals who have been to " key countries or regions " within the past 14 days must be quarantined for two weeks , the Shanghai government said today in a statement posted online . 
The statement on China 's Twitter like Weibo platform does not specify which countries this would apply to . 
However , as the number of coronavirus cases outside China grows , it is likely to be applied to nations such as South Korea and Iran , which are currently battling epidemics of their own . 
The city of Beijing announced a similar measure last week . 
" The public 's panic has not eased " : The Chinese government is attempting to get its economy back up and running as quickly as possible , as fewer new infections are reported across the country , especially outside of the outbreak epicenter of Hubei province . 
An editorial in state run tabloid Global Times published Monday admitted that there was reticence to get to work in China due to concerns of new infection clusters . 
" Many local officials dare not embrace the complete resumption of production and work , as if there is a new disease cluster , they would be blamed and have to take responsibility for it . "
