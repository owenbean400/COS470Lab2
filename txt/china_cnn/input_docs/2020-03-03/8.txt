China could have had three times as many coronavirus cases if it had delayed implementing strict quarantine measures by five days , according to a new study . 
The report , lead by Chinese respiratory expert Dr . Zhong Nanshan and published February 28 , said the finding was based on the use of a Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed ( SEIR ) epidemiological modeling . 
According to the latest National Health Commission figures , mainland China has recorded 80,151 cases of the virus and 2,943 deaths . 
Earlier action may have contained outbreak : Zhong and his team of experts also claimed that based on their model " had the interventions been introduced five days earlier , the epidemic peak should have been reached by February 15 , and the final number of cases would not exceed 25,000 . " 
Second peak prediction : But the study also warned that the easing of quarantine restrictions on Hubei province will allow " an influx of new susceptible individuals i.e . , migrants returning from the Spring Festival holidays , " leading to a " second epidemic peak in mid March . "
