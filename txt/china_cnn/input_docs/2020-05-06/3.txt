Hong Kong has ordered more than 173,000 people to undergo quarantine since the coronavirus outbreak began , city authorities said today . 
As of Monday , the city 's Department of Health has issued 103,543 mandatory quarantine orders to people arriving in the city from mainland China , Taiwan and Macao . 
A further 69,685 orders were issued for people arriving from elsewhere overseas . 
Hong Kong survived two waves of coronavirus . 
The city saw its first case in late January , and had just begun letting its guard down in late February when it was hit by a second wave . 
After a brief period of low case numbers , new infections spiked dramatically , prompting a series of additional stringent restrictions . 
That second wave now appears to have largely passed . 
Hong Kong has not had a case of local transmission in more than two weeks , and the city is cautiously resuming normal life .

The new guidelines , which will go into effect Friday , will allow more people to gather in public and some businesses to reopen .
