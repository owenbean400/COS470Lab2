South Korean lawmakers claim the coronavirus pandemic has caused residents of North Korea 's Pyongyang to stockpile daily necessities . 
Citing intelligence , South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung kee said the border blockade with China " is adding difficulties to North Koreans â€™ lives and economic activities , and prices of imported goods such as seasoning , sugar and etc . temporarily jumped and the exchange rate for dollar rose . " 
Kim said trade between China and North Korea from the first quarter had decreased 55 % from the same period last year and March was particularly hard hit with a 91 % drop . 
North Korea has not reported any coronavirus cases but , according to Kim , South Korea 's National Intelligence Service ( NIS ) said it ca not be ruled out given the human exchanges between China and North Korea " were brisk " before the blockade between the two countries was instituted in January . 
Why North Korea has not reported a single case : It 's unclear how North Korea has been able to avoid the virus , when its neighbors China , Russia and South Korea have experienced major outbreaks . 
Pyongyang has either been very lucky , is not saying something , or is reaping one of the few benefits of being a so called " hermit nation . "
