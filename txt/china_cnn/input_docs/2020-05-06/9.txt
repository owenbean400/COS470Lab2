A University of Pittsburgh research assistant professor , who was on the verge of making " very significant findings " toward Covid 19 , was shot and killed in an apparent murder suicide over the weekend , according to the university and police . 
Dr . Bing Liu was found in his home , and had suffered gunshot wounds to the head , neck , torso , and extremities , according to the Ross Police Department . 
Investigators believe an unidentified second man , who was found dead in his car , shot and killed Liu in the townhome before returning to his car and taking his own life . 
Police believe the men knew each other , but say there is " zero indication that there was targeting due to his ( Liu ) being Chinese , " according to Detective Sgt .
