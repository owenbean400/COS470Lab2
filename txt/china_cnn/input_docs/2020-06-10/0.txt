Do not go cold turkey -- at least not when it comes to easing lockdown restrictions . 
That 's the message of a new study that uses mathematical modeling to show that governments should not just turn off lockdown measures all at once for everyone , after infection rates have slowed , unless they want to risk a spike in coronavirus cases that threatens to overwhelm their health care system . 
" Decision makers -- pay attention to the math : emerging from lockdowns requires a gradual and phased approach to keep infection under control , " said Michael Bonsall from the Mathematical Ecology Research group at the University of Oxford , who helped lead the study team . 
Lockdown restrictions , or " anti contagion strategies , " have varied from country to country and state to state but include travel bans , school closures , work from home/stay at home orders , quarantining and isolation . 
They can reduce infection rates , spreading infections over a longer period in an approach known as flattening the curve . 
Thanks to lockdown measures , an estimated 60 million coronavirus infections were prevented in the United States , and 285 million in China , according to a separate study recently published in the journal Nature . 
But lockdowns have huge emotional costs and have crippled economies across the globe , including officially plunging the United States into a recession .
