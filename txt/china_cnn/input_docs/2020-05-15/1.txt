Mike Bowen , executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech , a medical supply company in Texas , said today the US dependence on foreign masks has been a national security issue for years . 
Bowen made the remarks today before a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing . 
Foreign dependence : Bowen said the issue of US dependence on China for masks is " not some multibillion dollar problem . " 
The issue , he said , amounts to " people trying to save pennies across the whole United States . " 
Bowen said to help end over reliance on foreign suppliers , the US government should say it is a national security problem . 
" It requires the ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) , telling America 's hospitals ' you ’re dependent on foreign made masks ’ and put them in legal liability . 
They have to protect their patients and staff , " he added . 
China controls most of the world ’s mask supply , Bowen said . 
China sells a box of masks for $ 1 , he said , while he sells them for about $ 5 . 
" Their prices are so cheap that they 've captured most of the world 's mask market , " he said . 
" Their masks cost less than the materials . 
If I take my labor costs totally out , I 'm still nowhere near the cost of their products , " Bowen said .
