David Culver , CNN 's China correspondent , is weighing in at the town hall on the situation in China . 
He is calling in from Shanghai . 
" We 've seen these fluctuations going up and down ( in case numbers ) , " Culver said . 
" It seems in Shanghai things are under control . 
You look at the numbers in Hubei ( province ) , it 's rather intense . 
Tens of thousands of people have been impacted by this and thousands have died . " 
What it 's like in Hubei : " We talked to folks an hour or so ago , I was on the phone with one resident checking in . 
They cannot leave their homes . 
They 're sealed within their residential complexes . 
Basic necessities come to them . 
Outside of that , here in Shanghai , a lot more flexibility and freedom to move around , " Culver said . 
Is the data trustworthy ? 
" We 've been asking that question , too , " Culver said . 
" We were hearing on the ground from folks who said , ' We know we might have it because our loved ones have been confirmed . 
We 're experienced the same symptoms , yet testing has been delayed . 
It 's not coming through . ' " On testing : " We can say that the federal government here , the central government under President Xi Jinping , they have moved forward with getting a lot of those test kits to where they need to be and it seems as though they are coming to a place where they are being readily available , " said Culver .
