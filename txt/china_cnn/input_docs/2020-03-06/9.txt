CNN 's coronavirus town hall is now answering questions from the audience and from our viewers at home . 
Here are a few of their questions answered : " This coronavirus likely jumped from animals to humans . 
In order for that to do that it mutated at some point , " said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta . 
" As it spreads through humans it continues to mutate somewhat . 
We know , for example , this patient in Washington , the first patient diagnosed in this country , they looked at the genome and they tried to match it to subs subsequent infections , and there was a lot of similarities , but the virus continues to mutate . " 
As for the repeat infection â€” we do not know yet for sure . 
There have been reports of people being infected more than once , but it 's unclear whether this is a testing issue . 
The virus does not appear to be affecting children as heavily . 
In China , the hardest hit country , less than 1 % of cases were children . 
But preventative measures can include wiping down surfaces and disinfecting commonly touched objects , as the virus can survive on surfaces .
