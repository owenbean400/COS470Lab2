Chinese officials studying the Wuhan coronavirus say most of the cluster cases they have observed from a study are within families . 
Cluster cases generally refer to " more than two infected cases within a limited space , " Wu Zunyou , a virus expert with China ’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said . 
Wu told reporters Tuesday that from a study of more than 1,000 cluster cases , 83 % were identified as family clusters . 
Other cluster cases appeared to be from schools , supermarkets or places of work which appeared to be caused by " poor awareness of protection , " such as not wearing masks . 
How do you protect yourself and others ? 
Officials at Tuesday ’s press conference reminded the public : if you have infected family members , rooms should be well ventilated , practice good hand hygiene , avoid public gathering and meal sharing , and employ good health practices if you have to take public transportation . 
The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness , such as coughing and sneezing . 
Scientists believe this coronavirus started in another animal and then spread to humans , so health officials recommend cooking meat and eggs thoroughly . 
But in general , the public should do " what you do every cold and flu season , " said Dr . John Wiesman , the health secretary in Washington state -- where the first US case of Wuhan coronavirus was confirmed . 
That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds , covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze , and disinfecting the objects and surfaces you touch if you are ill . 
If you or your doctor suspect you might have the coronavirus , the CDC advises wearing a surgical mask .
