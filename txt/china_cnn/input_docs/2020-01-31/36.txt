France and Italy are both sending planes to repatriate citizens from Wuhan , the city in central China where the novel coronavirus was first detected in December and which is now in lockdown . 
Italy is sending a military flight in the early hours of Monday to repatriate 70 Italians , Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said in a press conference Friday . 
The flight to Wuhan will carry some sanitary equipment requested by the Chinese authorities , Di Maio said . 
The returning passengers will be quarantined in a military facility for 14 days . 
Italy ’s government declared a state of emergency Friday morning a day after its first two cases of coronavirus – two Chinese tourists – were confirmed . 
Five million euros ( $ 5,500 ) have been allocated to use if needed to help fight the spread . 
Di Maio added that Chinese aircrafts currently on Italian soil have until Sunday to leave , and that it was coordinating with the Chinese embassy in Rome regarding any Chinese citizens who wanted to return home from Italy . 
Meanwhile , France said it was working on sending a second repatriation flight after a first one arrived on Friday . 
The French Health Minister Agnès Buzyn said in a press conference in Marseille that the French government is " doing everything [ they ] can to do organize a second plane . " 
Buzyn said that countries who lack the " logistical capacity " of France have asked for their help in repatriating citizens . 
Buzyn stated that " the idea is to bring in this plane all the nationalities who ask for our help and also the French that we can pick up . " 
Buzyn said that the plane will fly to France and that it will be " up to other the countries to come and collect their citizens . "
