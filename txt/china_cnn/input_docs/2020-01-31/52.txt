Photos exclusively obtained by CNN give a rare glimpse into a coronavirus isolation ward in Macao , the semi autonomous Chinese territory where seven people have contracted the virus . 
These are among the first photos showing treatment inside an isolation ward , aside from official images from Chinese state media . 
Medical workers , wearing face masks and protective suits , and a patient ( face obscured ) can be seen at the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário in Macao .
