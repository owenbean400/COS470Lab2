Germany has confirmed its fifth case of Wuhan coronavirus , in the southern state of Bavaria , according to a statement from the Bavarian Health Ministry on Thursday . 
The male patient is employed at the same workplace as the other four people who contracted the virus from a co worker visiting from China . 
The Chinese staff member is originally from Shanghai and has since flown back to China . 
She felt ill on the flight back and tested positive for the coronavirus after her return to Shanghai . 
The statement goes on to read that no further employees who work for the company in Bavaria tested positive for the virus . 
Around 110 people who were in close contact with all infected patients are still being tested for the novel coronavirus . 
Why this matters : These German cases are significant because most people diagnosed with the virus outside of China have recently traveled to the country -- but several of these German cases did not .
