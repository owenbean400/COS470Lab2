China 's Foreign Ministry has lashed out at " unfriendly " remarks by US officials related to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in a scathing statement . 
US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross ' comments that the virus could help bring jobs back to the US , officials implying that China was reluctant to cooperate with the US on epidemic control , and the State Department raising travel alarm on China to the same level as Iraq , were all among examples cited by the Ministry as " neither factual , nor appropriate . " 
Chunying added that China was fighting against the outbreak " with an open , transparent and responsible attitude " and the government has released information and shared data in a " timely fashion with the international community , " including the US . 
" A friend in need is a friend indeed , " Chunying said .
