A school district in Ontario , Canada is asking parents to not stoke fear and anxiety over the Coronavirus that could lead to racism and xenophobia . 
The district wrote the message to their community after becoming aware of a petition -- which thousands of parents signed -- asking the school district to keep students home from school for 17 days if they had family who visited China , according to CNN partner CBC . 
The York Region District School board chair Juanita Nathan and education director Louise Sirisko said : " individuals who make assumptions , even with positive intentions of safety , about the risk of others , request or demand quarantine can be seen as demonstrating bias and racism . " 
The board told CNN that the statement was " not written in reaction to any one source of misinformation , " but rather because they want to ensure all students feel safe and welcome at school .
