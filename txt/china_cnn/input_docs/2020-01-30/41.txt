The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern , after an emergency committee reconvened Thursday in Geneva . 
Last week , the organization said the virus did not yet constitute the emergency declaration . 
But with rising numbers and evidence of person to person transmission in a handful of cases outside of China , WHO leadership called the committee back together due to the " potential for a much larger outbreak , " WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters earlier this week . 
WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as " an extraordinary event " that constitutes a " public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease " and " to potentially require a coordinated international response . " 
Previous emergencies have included Ebola , Zika and H1N1 .
