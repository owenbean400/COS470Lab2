International rights group Human Rights Watch has said the Chinese government should ensure that human rights are protected while responding to the coronavirus outbreak . 
In a statement , the rights group said that the government 's initial response to the outbreak was " delayed by withholding information from the public , underreporting cases of infection , downplaying the severity of the infection , and dismissing the likelihood of transmission between humans . " 
But since mid January , China ramped up its response as the number of confirmed cases of the virus drastically increased . 
Almost 60 million people are living under a full or partial lockdown in Hubei province -- where the outbreak originated . 
" In addition , authorities have detained people for ' rumor mongering , ' censored online discussions of the epidemic , curbed media reporting , and failed to ensure appropriate access to medical care for those with virus symptoms and others with medical needs , " the statement said .
