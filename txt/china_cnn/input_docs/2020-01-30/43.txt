The Allied Pilots Association , a union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots , has sued the company to halt the carrier 's US China service , citing " serious , and in many ways still unknown , health threats posed by the coronavirus . " 
The union asked the court for a temporary and immediate restraining order halting the flights as the virus spreads . 
" The safety and well being of our crews and passengers must always be our highest priority , first , last , and always , " said APA President Capt . Eric Ferguson . 
" Numerous other major carriers that serve China , including British Airways , Air Canada , and Lufthansa , have chosen to suspend service to that country out of an abundance of caution . "
