Canada 's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam is urging people to stop acts of racism against people of Chinese and Asian descent due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
" It is understandable that our fears increase during times like this . 
However , we need to remember that cohesion in our collective efforts is important , " Tam said . 
" We need to learn from our experience with SARS , where South East Asians faced significant racism and discrimination . " 
" Racism , discrimination and stigmatizing language are unacceptable and very hurtful . 
These actions create a divide of Us Vs . 
Them . 
Canada is a country built on the deep rooted values of respect , diversity and inclusion , " she added .
