World Health Organization officials cautioned countries rushing to develop coronavirus vaccines , saying emergency use authorization must be done with great care . 
China and Russia say they will start deploying vaccines before completing late stage clinical trials , and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn has said if the US gets enough data from advanced trials , it might be possible to authorize a vaccine before the trials are completed . 
Asked about what the three countries are planning , WHO officials said it ’s important to make sure a vaccine is at least safe and works before using one broadly . 
While it is up to the national regulatory authority of every country to make decisions about approvals , WHO has on its website a guidance document that lays out step by step what the approach for their emergency use listing procedure would be , she said . 
Any country ’s vaccine policy " must be guided by the highest possible ethical standard , the highest possible scientific standards , " said Dr . Mike Ryan , director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Program . 
There are examples of vaccines that were rolled out before data collection was complete , Ryan added . 
Ebola is one . 
But data was carefully collected even as groups rushed to vaccinate people during recent Ebola outbreaks . 
" You need to maintain monitoring , " Ryan said .
