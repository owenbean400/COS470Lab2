The Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 5 % and the Dow fell 700 points — or 2.6 % — on Thursday The S&P was down 3.4 % . 
Stocks tumbled just one day after hitting a record high . 
The Nasdaq had climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday . 
So what 's happening ? 
Well for one , the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes — the Dow and the S&P 500 — for months , so investors might just be taking making some adjustments after Wednesday 's record highs . 
The Nasdaq remains up nearly 30 % in 2020 , far outpacing its counterparts . 
But there are also technical reasons for Thursday 's decline . 
As US China relations sour , investors are moving money out of tech , which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs . 
The Big Tech companies such as Amazon , Google and Microsoft , all of which are part of the Nasdaq , have become the safe haven investment of the summer . 
But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam , either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether .
