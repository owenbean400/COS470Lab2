The government of Hubei province , the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak , on Friday banned the practice of reducing the number of already confirmed cases . 
It also mandated that all previously counted cases stand as part of the total confirmed tally . 
Tu Yuanchao , deputy director of Hubei Health Committee , said at a press conference that all the cases that were confirmed but then retroactively dismissed because they no longer fitted reporting requirements would be added back to the total tally . 
On Thursday -- based on China 's National Health Commission ’s narrowed criteria for confirmed tally to only include laboratory confirmed cases -- Hubei authorities said they 'd no longer count so called " clinically diagnosed patients , " who are people exhibiting symptoms without testing positive for the virus . 
This caused Hubei ’s total confirmed cases to drop by 279 on Thursday alone .
