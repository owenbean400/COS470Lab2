China has changed how it counts coronavirus cases in Hubei province three times now — but a World Health Organization official told reporters during a media briefing on Friday that is normal during an active outbreak . 
" It ’s really numbers for action and not numbers for numbers , " she said . 
" As long as we understand how things are counted and what the numbers include then it helps us to make the best possible decision to protect the health of people . " 
Last week , China announced it would count " clinically diagnosed " cases in its tally for Hubei province , the epicenter of the outbreak . 
Then yesterday , the government changed its approach and " clinically confirmed " were excluded from the tally of confirmed cases .
