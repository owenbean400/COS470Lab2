China 's car market is getting crushed because of the novel coronavirus outbreak . 
Passenger car sales plunged 92 % through the first half of February , according to statistics from the China Passenger Car Association . 
The industry group blamed the coronavirus and the Lunar New Year holiday , and said it expects sales for all of February to fall 70 % . 
The association said the decline should be temporary , but added that the speed of the market 's recovery depends on how local governments handle the public health crisis . 
The massive decline is yet another indication of how damaging the coronavirus has been for the auto industry . 
Earlier this month , China 's Association of Automobile Manufacturers said that major automakers sold fewer than 2 million cars in the country in January -- an 18 % plunge from a year earlier . 
Billions in losses : Some analysts and state run media have already said that the coronavirus fallout could cost the Chinese economy a few percentage points of growth . 
In dollar terms , that could lose the country more than $ 60 billion .
