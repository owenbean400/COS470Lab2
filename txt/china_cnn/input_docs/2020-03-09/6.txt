South Korea is seeing an apparent slowdown in the number of new cases per day -- but there may be other factors at play , and it 's too early to say the infection itself is slowing , said South Korean officials today . 
Yesterday , the country reported the lowest number of new infections per day since February 26 . 
This is the lowest number of new daily infections since February 26 . 
Kim Ganglip , Deputy of Central Disaster Relief Headquarters , spoke about the slowdown at a press briefing , but warned that there are still sporadic cluster infections in facilities such as nursing homes and residential complexes . 
There may also be other reasons for this perceived slowdown -- bad weather conditions over the weekend may have caused fewer people to leave home to get tested , leading to a decrease in case numbers .

More than half of all nationwide cases have links to the Shincheonji religious group , based in the country 's south .
