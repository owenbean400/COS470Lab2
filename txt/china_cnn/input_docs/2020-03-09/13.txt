An evacuation flight with foreign diplomats who were quarantined in North Korea has landed in Vladivostok with 103 people onboard , a source on the flight told CNN . 
The source agreed to speak to CNN on condition of anonymity , due to the sensitivity of the situation . 
French and German embassies in North Korea will be temporarily closed , according to the British Ambassador for North Korea , Colin Crooks . 
Crooks tweeted that the British Embassy would remain open . 
CNN previously reported foreign diplomats had been kept in complete isolation since early February , amid concerns about the potential spread of novel coronavirus inside North Korea . 
The exact number of foreign diplomats stationed inside the country is unknown , but is estimated to be just a few hundred . 
North Korea has not confirmed a single case of the virus inside the country , but global health experts have warned the country is highly susceptible to an outbreak given its close proximity to China and limited medical capabilities .
