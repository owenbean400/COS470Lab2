Six prisoners have died in a Modena prison after riots broke out in several Italian jails following the suspension of visits to curb the spread of the coronavirus , according to authorities . 
Riots occurred on Sunday in Modena , Frosinone , Naples , Pavia , Alessandria and Foggia prisons , according to a statement by the Italian justice ministry . 
The disturbances ended on Sunday evening . 
" The protests concerned the coronavirus emergency , as well as the measures issued by the government to reduce the risk of infection and protect those who lives and works within the prison , " the statement wrote . 
During the Modena prison riot , prisoners occupied the entire prison including the infirmary where they got hold of various drugs including methadone , the director of the Italian penitentiary system , Francesco Basentini , said in an interview Monday . 
Two of the dead died of an overdose , one of inhalation of toxic smoke and three died after all the inmates were moved to another prison -- those deaths are still being investigated . 
Basentini explained that a prison in Salerno , in southern Italy , was the first to riot last Saturday , leading to a " wave " of revolts . 
In Modena , all inmates have been moved to nearby buildings as the prison is unusable , according to the ministry . 
Italian lockdown : This comes after a Sunday decree put most of Italy 's north under lockdown in a bid to contain the virus . 
While Modena is not affected by the lockdown , restrictions have been imposed throughout the rest of Italy , including the suspension of events at cinemas , theaters , museums and sports arenas . 
This comes as Italy has recorded 7,375 cases and 366 deaths , the most fatalities outside mainland China .
