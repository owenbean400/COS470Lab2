Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree early Sunday that enforces sweeping quarantine measures across most of Italy 's northern regions in response to the coronavirus outbreak . 
The decree , which went into effect on Sunday , impacts the lives of nearly 16 million people . 
The unprecedented move places travel restrictions on the entire Lombardy region , as well as 14 other provinces . 
The lockdown is the toughest control measure to be implemented outside of mainland China since the emergence of the virus in December last year . 
The lockdown areas , or " red zones , " are subject to strict measures , including the cancellation of all public events , civil and religious ceremonies , closure of schools and universities , and the cancellation of sporting events . 
The rest of the country is also subject to less expansive preventative measures . 
The announcement came after Italy saw a dramatic spike of 1,247 confirmed novel coronavirus cases on Saturday .
