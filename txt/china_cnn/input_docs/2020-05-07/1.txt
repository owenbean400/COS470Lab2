Some doctors are urging the continued use of the HIV drugs lopinavir–ritonavir to treat severely ill patients with coronavirus , even though a recent study found no significant difference in recovery time between patients taking the drugs and those who were not . 
Doctors from several universities , including Columbia , Michigan State and the University of Pennsylvania , wrote letters published in the New England Journal of Medicine this week saying there were indications the drug combination might help some patients . 
A study published in March showed patients in China who were given the lopinavir ritonavir combination did not recover any faster . 
But Dr . Piero Dalerba , an assistant professor in the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center , and two of his colleagues said secondary findings were " actually very promising . " 
Health experts agree more research is needed on the drug combination and are hoping a much larger study by the World Health Organization on drugs that could be used to treat the coronavirus , including lopinavir–ritonavir , could offer more insight into a possible treatment for the virus .
