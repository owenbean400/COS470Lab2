New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Thursday on CNN ’s coronavirus town hall that the city has about six days at " the current burn rate of ventilators . " 
Cuomo said the state has purchased 17,000 ventilators but they have not been delivered because they are coming from China and there are 50 states and the federal government all competing for the equipment . 
New York only has 4,000 ventilators in the state , Cuomo said . 
Cuomo said that once New York runs out of ventilators , the state will have to share the machines between patients , use Bi Pap machines , anesthesia machines and other creative strategies such as canceling all non elective surgeries to provide people the care they need . 
He also said he will redeploy the ventilators to the places that need them the most . 
President Donald Trump ’s effort to work with General Motors and Ford to manufacture more ventilators comes too late for the apex of the disease in New York , Cuomo said . 
Cuomo questioned why national resources could not be deployed to stay ahead of the curve . 
States , he said , cannot manage the ventilator problem on their own . 
The governor said while the President has been critical of him during this pandemic , that they have a " very honest relationship . " 
Trump helped New York convert the Javits Center into a 2,500 bed Covid 19 facility .
