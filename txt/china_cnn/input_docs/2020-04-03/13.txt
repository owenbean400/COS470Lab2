Even though some early data out of Wuhan , China , suggests that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could " significantly " shorten the time it takes for Covid 19 patients to recover from illness , US infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci warned that more research is needed to determine that drug 's effectiveness against Covid 19 . 
That early data is not " very robust , " Fauci said on " Fox & Friends . " 
" We still need to do the kinds of studies that definitively prove whether any intervention — not just this one — any intervention is truly safe and effective , " Fauci said . 
" But when you do not have that information it 's understandable , and I grant that , it 's understandable why people may want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of it being effective and I have no problem with that . "
