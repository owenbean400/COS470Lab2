Robert Kraft , the owner of the New England Patriots , recently purchased 1.2 million N95 protective masks to donate to the state of Massachusetts and another 300,000 for New York state . 
He joined CNN 's coronavirus town hall to explain how it got done . 
Kraft explained that his eldest son , who is the chairman of the board of Massachusetts General Hospital , is close with the state 's governor , Charlie Baker . 
Baker asked if there was a way that the state could get the masks bought in China . 
So Kraft offered to use the team 's jet , which was sitting idle . 
Kraft said he believes both Baker and New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo , who was on CNN at the time , were both doing a great job . 
Gov . 
Cuomo said the call he got from Kraft saying they were getting the extra masks was probably " the only good call I 've gotten in about 10 days . "
