Like many Americans across the country , Wenqiong Xue has been fanatically making face masks for two weeks , using ripped bedsheets and a sewing machine that she dusted off from a closet in her Boston area house . 
But the homemaker in Medfield , Massachusetts , is more than just a mask maker -- she has become a mask advocate , long before President Donald Trump 's coronavirus task force is expected to recommend that Americans begin wearing face coverings in public . 
A Beijing native who has lived in the US since 1985 , Xue said many Chinese Americans like her realized early on the importance of wearing masks in stopping the spread of the deadly virus , thanks to a steady stream of news reports and expert opinions from China , the original epicenter of the global pandemic . 
Xue and other members of a local We Chat group sewed more than 1,300 masks within a week , delivering them to several local hospitals . 
But even when the medical institutions advised them not to send in any more handmade masks , Xue did not stop -- shifting her focus to the general public . 
Trying to convince most Americans about the usefulness of wearing masks has not been easy , though , due to long held cultural beliefs . 
Xue said even her adult children , born and raised in the US , have been resistant to the idea . 
Xue remains undaunted , determined to shine a spotlight on the topic as she believes Americans are lagged behind in self protection due to lack of accurate information . 
Feeling heartened by the sight of a growing number of people wearing masks outdoors -- observed during her occasional grocery shopping trips -- Xue thinks new US government guidance on the issue would not only prompt more Americans to cover their faces in public but also spur the demand for DIY masks .
