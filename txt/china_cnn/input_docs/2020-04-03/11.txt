The top US general in South Korea says that he does not believe North Korea â€™s claim it has no cases of novel coronavirus . 
" How many ? 
I could not tell you but I do know by their actions that for about 30 days in February , early March , that their military was locked down and they took draconian methods on their border crossings and in their formations . " 
North Korea has not reported any coronavirus infections , but it borders two of the most heavily affected countries in the region -- China and South Korea . 
While the 16th USFK related coronavirus infection was reported yesterday , Abrams said the military force has managed to keep that number low . 
" We 've seen the worst but now is not the time to get complacent . 
Our worst is frankly not that bad , " Abrams said .
