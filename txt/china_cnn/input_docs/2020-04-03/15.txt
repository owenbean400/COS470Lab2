The coronavirus pandemic is starting to noticeably damage economic data around the world . 
The global composite output index , produced by JPMorgan and IHS Markit , slumped to 39.4 points in March , its fastest drop in some 11 years . 
Any level below 50 denotes an economic contraction . 
Even though the index had been in contraction territory in the prior month as well — 46.1 points in February — the drop off was the second biggest on record , surpassed only by a drop in October 2001 . 
Looking closer at the global services sector , business activity , new business and new export business all dropped at the sharpest rate in survey history . 
Not all countries were hit the same : China , which was hit by the pandemic earlier in the year , got some respite from its rate of contraction . 
The outbreak is still sweeping across the United States , where business activity dropped to the greatest extent since the height of the 2007-2009 financial crisis . 
Still , America saw the weakest downturn among its developed world peers .
