China has advised foreign embassies to stop sending diplomats to Beijing for work or rotation , amid growing concerns over imported coronavirus cases and continuously tightening regulations targeting international arrivals . 
A foreign ministry official said Friday the move was purely in response to global developments of the pandemic , as well as out of concern for the health and safety of foreign diplomats . 
She said it is also in line with advice from the World Health Organization and other experts . 
" The virus is an equalizer – while diplomats enjoy immunity , they are not immune from the virus , " said Hua Chunying , a ministry spokeswoman , at a regular press briefing . 
Hua said there had been confirmed cases among foreign diplomats who recently arrived in China . 
She added that , of the 84 foreign diplomats who arrived in China in the past week , 66 % of them had become close contacts of confirmed cases . 
She emphasized that all of China ’s containment measures treat Chinese and foreign citizens equally and fairly . 
China has already drastically cut the number of international flights and diverted all Beijing bound international flights to other Chinese cities . 
Last weekend , the country shut its borders to most foreigners – although diplomats have been exempted .
