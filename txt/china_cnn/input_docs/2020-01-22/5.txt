China on Tuesday announced it was adopting Class A prevention and control measures to tackle the Wuhan coronavirus . 
Such measures are typically used for dangerous diseases such as plague and cholera . 
This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients . 
China previously used such measures in 2009 to tackle an outbreak of H1N1 , introducing mandatory quarantine for anyone who had " close contact " with an infected person , including foreigners arriving in the country from areas where H1N1 outbreaks had been reported . 
The virus itself remains classified as a Class B infection , despite the more serious response .
