In the heart of Wuhan 's city center is the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market . 
Under normal circumstances it would be packed with shoppers scrambling for fish and seafood in preparation of the Lunar New Year . 
The holiday pretty much revolves around the dining table , as reunited families catch up with each other and visiting friends . 
But this year the market stands empty , its entranceway cordoned off and guarded by police and security officials in medical masks . 
The usually congested streets surrounding the market are also deserted . 
No one here is taking any chances . 
Chinese authorities and scientists have pointed to wild animals sold at the market as the likely source of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed nine people and sickened 440 inside China in a matter of weeks . 
The virus has also spread to Thailand , Japan , South Korea and the United States , sparking fears of a potential global pandemic . 
Though the market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection , health authorities have so far been unable to determine which animals harbored the virus . 
The new strain of coronavirus , which can infect both animals and humans , is in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) . 
Li Bin , China 's national health commissioner , said Wednesday that officials are aware of around 2,200 cases of " close contact " with known virus carriers . 
Regarding suspected cases , 715 patients have been discharged while more than 300 patients remain on medical watch .
