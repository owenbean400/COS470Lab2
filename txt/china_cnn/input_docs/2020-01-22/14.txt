As the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond , Chinese state media has published a number of unusually scathing commentaries criticizing local authorities in Wuhan for their alleged incompetence . 
In a commentary by People ’s Daily on Tuesday night , the state run newspaper criticized Wuhan officials for handing out 200,000 free tickets to the city ’s tourist attractions even after the outbreak was reported . 
" Officials only woke up from their dreams and postponed the event after public uproar , " said the commentary . 
It also blamed officials for creating unnecessary fear by delaying the closure of a seafood market linked to the outbreak and failing to provide updates in a timely manner . 
" This shows an ignorance of the prevention of infectious diseases , and a disregard for the health risks of oneself and others . " 
Another commentary published by the Global Times said the dissemination of crucial information had " undoubtedly " taken too long . 
With the Internet , people now demand greater transparency from government officials , it said . 
" If people were aware of the real risks associated with the new pneumonia earlier , they would be more cautious and have extra thoughts before entering or leaving Wuhan . " 
The articles were published after Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered " resolute efforts to curb the spread " of the virus during a televised broadcast Monday . 
Xi 's intervention appears to have prompted health authorities to upgrade their response to the virus to the highest level . 
On Tuesday , officials in Wuhan announced a series of new measures , including the cancellation of upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations , which had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people .
