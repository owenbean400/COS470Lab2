The Chinese embassy in Denmark has blasted one of the country 's top newspapers for a cartoon about the Wuhan coronavirus that riffed on China 's national flag . 
The cartoon , published in Jyllands Posten on Monday , showed the red flag with its yellow stars replaced by virus molecules . 
In a statement published online , an embassy spokesperson said the drawing was " an insult to China and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people . " 
According to Agence France Presse , Jyllands Posten 's chief editor Jacob Nybroe said the paper would not " dream of " poking fun at the dire situation the virus has caused in China , but refused to apologize " for something we do not think is wrong . " 
" We have no intention of being demeaning or to mock , nor do we think that the drawing does , " Nybroe said . 
" As far as I can see , this here is about different forms of cultural understanding . " 
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was quoted by the Politiken newspaper as saying " we have freedom of expression in Denmark . 
Also to draw " . 
Jyllands Posten is no stranger to cartoon controversy . 
In 2005 , it published depictions of the Prophet Mohammed deemed offensive by many Muslims , including one showing the founder of Islam wearing a bomb as a turban . 
The paper apologized , but the cartoons were seized upon by radical preachers in the Middle East and sparked several riots and attacks on Danish embassies in the region .
