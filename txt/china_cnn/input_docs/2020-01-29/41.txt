US retailers with production in China are still trying to assess the effect of the coronavirus on their supply chains . 
Many plants and factories were already closed for the Lunar New Year , so companies are considering keeping some closed while the outbreak continues , according to Jonathan Gold , vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation . 
The National Retail Federation has been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security and US Customs & Border Protection who report they have not experienced any disruption in shipping and supply routes thus far . 
US retailers are prepared for these types of scenarios , according to Gold . 
Retailers spend time and money on contingency plans for pandemics such as SARS and the coronavirus , and can move quickly to put alternative plans in place . 
However , they " are waiting to see what their response should be , " he said . 
What may happen in the future : One factor that will effect those contingency plans include a major shutdown in air travel , which would halt the transportation of cargo , Gold said . 
US retailers are in constant contact with vendors , but are in the " wait and see period . " 
Gold points out that retail is not just impacted on the supply chain side , but that a slowdown in tourism from China could affect US retailers .
