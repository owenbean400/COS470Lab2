Hong Kong 's leader , Carrie Lam , announced a range of measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus yesterday -- but for some local medical workers , it 's not enough . 
The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance ( HAEA ) , a public medical union , criticized Lam for exaggerating the effectiveness of measures that are only " slightly more constructive " than before . 
" The government should fully prevent all non crucial and unnecessary passengers flow from China to Hong Kong , " said HAEA in a statement , adding that there was still " a considerable distance from our goal of a full scale preventive measures . " 
Medics on strike : Last week , the union threatened to strike , demanding a complete ban on mainland Chinese tourists entering Hong Kong . 
On Facebook , the union said its membership rose significantly from about 6,000 to 15,000 on Tuesday , with long queues forming outside its membership registration center . 
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority , which runs public hospitals , has a workforce of about 80,000 . 
Ho Pak leung , a clinical professor at the University of Hong Kong Department of Microbiology , also called on Lam to fully seal its border with China during a radio program on public broadcaster RTHK Wednesday .
