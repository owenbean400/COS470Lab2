As of Wednesday , there were 5,974 confirmed cases of the virus in China , including 132 deaths , according to the National Health Commission ( NHC ) . 
The number of cases grew by almost 1,500 from Tuesday , a more than 30 % increase . 
From Sunday to Monday the number of cases confirmed in China had jumped by 65 % . 
With the number of confirmed cases increasing day by day , concern is growing over the global spread of the virus . 
Numerous countries , including the US , have stepped up airport screenings and warned their citizens not to travel to China . 
Some countries , including Indonesia and the Philippines , have restricted Chinese tourists . 
Chinese authorities say they are throwing everything they have into containing the infection within its borders . 
Wuhan â€™s Communist Party chief Ma Guoqiang said in a press conference that the sudden increase in confirmed cases is down to more efficient testing measures . 
Before January 14 , all the testing for the Wuhan coronavirus was done by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , which as a " very long process , " Ma said . 
" To confirm a case in Wuhan , ( we ) needed to send his sample to the national CDC , " he said . 
To speed up that process , from January 16 the Chinese central government allowed the Hubei provincial CDC to conduct the tests . 
" So our samples are no longer required to be sent to Beijing , and can be tested at the provincial CDC , with a capacity of testing about 300 cases ( per day ) , " Ma said . 
The rate of testing also increased from January 24 , as nine hospitals could test the samples , " which drastically increased our testing capacity and efficiency . "
