An expert from the World Health Organization said the peak of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak ca not be predicted . 
" The peak will occur as soon as we put together a package of interventions that are designed to stop the virus , " Ryan added . 
" So we need to focus not on where the peak is ; we need to focus on our actions in the coming days and weeks . " 
Ryan 's comments come the day after Zhong Nanshan , the director of China ’s National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease , told China ’s State News Agency Xinhua that he expects the novel coronavirus outbreak to possibly reach its peak in one week or around 10 days from now . 
Previously , professor Gabriel Leung , chair of public health medicine at University of Hong Kong , predicted that the peak would come between mid May and mid April for major city clusters in mainland China .
