The number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in China has now officially exceeded that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak in 2002 and 2003 . 
At least 5,974 cases of the coronavirus have been reported in mainland China to date , whereas there were 5,327 confirmed cases of SARS on August 16 , 2003 , the last time the Chinese health ministry reported such data . 
The government stopped reporting SARS cases after that date , saying there were no more new cases nationwide . 
In total , there were 8,098 confirmed cases of SARS worldwide from November 2002 to July 2003 , with 774 deaths . 
While the current coronavirus outbreak does not appear to be as deadly as SARS , it may be spreading more rapidly . 
That could be due to being more contagious , or the increased interconnectedness of both China and the world than in 2003 .
