The US diplomats and their families traveling on a charter flight from Wuhan , China may be forced to stay isolation between three days and two weeks , a San Bernardino County , California , official told CNN . 
Curt Hagman , chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors , said authorities are setting up beds , phone chargers and televisions in an isolated , dormant hangar at Ontario International Airport , as they wait to receive a group of US citizens who left Wuhan , China with a final destination to Ontario , California . 
Upon arrival in California , the travelers will be offloaded into the hangar on the opposite side of the airport from the public terminals . 
Hagman said Ontario ’s airport was chosen because it ’s one of two airports designated by the US government for repatriations on the West Coast . 
Hagman said after the travelers are screened for coronavirus during a refueling stopover in Anchorage , Alaska , they ’ll be screened again in Ontario . 
Hagman notes there are no indications any of the travelers have the virus . 
His messages to the community : " Do not panic this is what we ’ve been trained for . " 
Hagman said they have no idea how long the travelers will be staying , and they are getting ready to have them watch the Super Bowl in an airport hangar if needed .
