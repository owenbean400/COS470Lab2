A senior administration official is denying a report that the White House has asked US airlines to suspend flights between the US and China as a way to help contain the spread the deadly coronavirus . 
A White House aide said that at a Monday session looking at ways to contain the spread of the virus , the notion of travel restrictions to China was raised . 
And on Tuesday , Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar declined to rule out such a possibility , saying nothing was off the table . 
Azar also told reporters that he and Trump were " speaking regularly " about the coronavirus outbreak , which has infected close to 6,000 people in China and that he was in daily contact with White House officials . 
" The President is highly engaged in this response and closely monitoring the work we 're doing to keep Americans safe , " Azar said . 
A White House source described the attitude toward coronavirus as a " sense of urgency , not panic . " 
Inside the White House , the government 's cross agency response is being coordinated by the National Security Council , with Matt Pottinger , the deputy national security adviser , leading near daily meetings , according to administration officials .
