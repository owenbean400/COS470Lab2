China has drastically scaled up its emergency use program in recent weeks , officials revealed Thursday as they announced the approval of the country 's first homegrown coronavirus vaccine , developed by Sinopharm . 
Since December 15 , the country has administered more than 3 million doses of coronavirus vaccines on " key groups " in the population , Zeng Yixin , vice minister of China 's National Health Commission , said at a news conference Thursday . 
He did not identify who those groups were . 
That 's on top of the more than 1.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccines administered to " high risk groups " as of the end of November , Zeng added . 
Among those who have been inoculated , fewer than 0.1 % developed a light fever , and about two people per million developed " relative serious adverse reactions " such as allergies , according to Zeng . 
China rolled out its controversial emergency use program in July , inoculating hundreds of thousands of people with experimental vaccines that did not have their safety and efficacy proven in clinical trials . 
People who received the vaccines include healthcare workers , border control personnel and state owned company employees who needed to travel overseas . 
This post has been updated to accurately reflect the number of adverse reactions .
