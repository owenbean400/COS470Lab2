The US based company Plasma Technologies LLC has signed a $ 750,000 contract with the Department of Defense to develop scaled up Covid 19 convalescent plasma technologies , the Do D announced Monday . 
It 's the latest development in the effort to use a 19th century treatment to help 21st century patients . 
The contract is to develop a new convalescent blood plasma process that makes more serum derived products , and faster . 
What is the treatment ? 
Convalescent plasma is a treatment created out of blood from people who have recovered from an infection such as Covid 19 . 
Plasma is the liquid portion of blood containing immune cells and antibodies -- proteins the body makes to fight infection . 
The plasma can be infused into a sick person to help recovery . 
Since the Victorian era , doctors have used this treatment to fight severe cases of the flu . 
The treatment has also shown success with two other deadly coronaviruses - MERS and SARS . 
Does it work ? 
Nearly 67,000 people have been infused with the treatment and nearly 14,000 physicians are using it , according to UScovidplasma.org -- but it 's still not clear if it works . 
Early on , a handful of small studies in China looked promising . 
Several studies are still under way . 
Absent other treatments for Covid 19 , doctors in the US have opted to use the treatment as it was still being studied .
