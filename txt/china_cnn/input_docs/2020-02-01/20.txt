Two hospitals were built in under a week in Wuhan , and are due to start accepting patients on Monday and Thursday , according to state media . 
They will focus specifically on coronavirus patients , providing some relief to Wuhan 's stretched health system . 
The Lunar New Year holiday will be extended in Hubei to an " appropriate extent , " authorities said . 
But it remains unclear how long parts of the country can continue to remain under lockdown , both from the perspective of making sure they have crucial supplies like food , and from an economic point -- both the national finances and people 's personal pocketbooks will be taking a massive hit from next week .
