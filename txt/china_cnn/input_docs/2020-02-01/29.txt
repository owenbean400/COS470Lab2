Qatar Airways is the latest airline to suspend flights to China over the coronavirus outbreak . 
The carrier said it will " unfortunately " stop flying to China on Monday , due to " significant operational challenges caused by entry restrictions imposed by several countries . " 
" These restrictions prevent the airline from scheduling crew on certain routes , limiting our ability to maintain scheduled operations elsewhere , " the airline said in a statement .
