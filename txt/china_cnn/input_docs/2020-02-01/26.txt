The World Health Organization has been stressing the importance of facts in the fight against the current coronavirus outbreak . 
It warned that people of all ages can be infected by the virus and said older people and those with pre existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus . 
The WHO is also trying to bust some of the myths circulating online . 
It said , for example , that there was no evidence that pets such as dogs and cats can be infected with the virus . 
It also told people it was safe to receive packages from China . 
" From previous analysis , we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects , such as letters or packages , " the WHO tweeted .
