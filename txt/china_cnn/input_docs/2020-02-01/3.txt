The number of novel coronavirus cases in mainland China jumped by 2,102 on Friday , said the country 's National Health Commission on Saturday . 
That makes the nationwide total 11,791 cases , including 259 deaths . 
We 've been seeing dramatic day by day jumps in numbers in recent weeks . 
From last Sunday to Monday , the number of cases confirmed in China had jumped by 65 % -- and again by more than 30 % from Monday to Tuesday . 
What this means : It does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading faster -- the timing of cases confirmed could be impacted by a delay between patients being infected , noticing symptoms , seeking medical care , and labs confirming results . 
It 's also dependent on the technology being used to test for coronavirus . 
Wuhan 's Communist Party chief said this week that more efficient testing methods meant they could now confirm many more cases than before .
