Chinese Premier Li Keqiang , the country 's second highest ranking politician , laid out emergency response measures to the coronavirus outbreak in a press release on Saturday . 
Here are the highlights : Lunar New Year : The public holiday will be extended for people currently in Hubei province who work elsewhere , while regions with high infection rates can suspend schools or businesses longer . 
Screenings : Li urged coach stations , airports , ports , and other transportation hubs to conduct temperature screenings and provide proper sanitation . 
Containment : The statement urged people on public transit to take precautions , and said local authorities in Hubei should provide " special arrangements " to protect the health for returning migrant workers . 
Supplies : The statement emphasized the importance of distributing enough medical supplies across the nation , with special priority for areas like Wuhan . 
Transparency after censorship : The statement also emphasized the need for transparency -- a rarity in China , where the country 's colossal censorship apparatus keeps tight control of the narrative . 
The call for openness comes after local Hubei authorities initially tried to downplay the severity of the outbreak when it emerged in December . 
Police arrested " rumormongers , " and censors deleted any commentary that questioned the official line .
