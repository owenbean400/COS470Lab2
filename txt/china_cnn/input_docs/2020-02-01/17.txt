The city of Huanggang in China â€™s Hubei province is only allowing one representative from each household to leave their home every other day to go outside and buy groceries . 
The Huanggang government said the measure was to minimize the flow of people in the city amid the coronavirus outbreak , which started in nearby Wuhan . 
Apart from the designated representative , the only other people allowed out of their homes are people seeking medical attention , or working in virus control , pharmacies and supermarkets . 
Much of Hubei province remains under partial or full lockdown -- this is where the outbreak began , and where most of the deaths and cases have occurred .
