The number of confirmed coronavirus cases is nearing 12,000 as the epidemic continues to spread worldwide , sparking travel bans and outbreaks of ugly anti Chinese xenophobia . 
The number of confirmed cases in China grew by 2,102 on Friday , bringing the total to 11,791 nationwide . 
An additional 46 people died , pushing the death toll to 259 . 
The pronounced increase in cases and deaths show the virus is not slowing , even after over a week of much of full or partial lockdowns in the worst hit areas and an extended public holiday . 
With most of China due to return to work on Monday , the concern will be how far the virus will now spread , and whether the country 's economy can bear the type of further quarantines and travel restrictions that may be necessary to rein it in .
