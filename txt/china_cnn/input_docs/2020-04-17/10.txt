In one Chinese hospital , most pregnant women with Covid 19 had a relatively mild form of the disease , according to research published Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine . 
Looking at a hospital in Wuhan , China , researchers found that 109 women – out of 118 total – had a " mild " form of coronavirus . 
That ’s about 92 % of the women , who were considered to have Covid 19 based on a positive test result or a CT scan of the chest . 
Nine women – 8 % of those in the study – had severe cases of coronavirus , with abnormally low levels of oxygen in their blood . 
One patient required a noninvasive form of mechanical ventilation , which researchers considered to be " critical " form of the disease . 
Severe cases of coronavirus developed most often after women had given birth , developing after delivery in six of the nine women . 
There were no deaths , according to the study . 
Researchers also tested eight newborns , none of whom were positive for the virus . 
And breast milk samples from three mothers also tested negative . 
The role of gender : The researchers pointed out that women in general seem to have lower rates of severe Covid 19 compared to men . 
And pregnant women tend to be younger , too : the median age of the women in the study was 31 years old , and Covid 19 is often more severe in people who are older . 
There ’s a lot we do not know about coronavirus and pregnancy , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
But based on available information , the agency says " pregnant people seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant . " 
It ’s also unlikely that women will pass the virus to their children during childbirth , according to the CDC . 
" Mother to child transmission of coronavirus during pregnancy is unlikely , but after birth a newborn is susceptible to person to person spread . "
