Wuhan city officials said they have revised the coronavirus death toll on Friday and added 1,290 new deaths . 
The new death toll for Wuhan as of end of day Thursday is 3,869 , the city government said . 
Wuhan also revised the confirmed number of coronavirus cases by increasing its total number by 325 , bringing the total to 50,333 cases . 
Officials said they revised the figures to show " accountability to history , to the people and the victims , " as well as to ensure " open and transparent disclosure of information and data accuracy " -- and the new data is the result of extensive work involving numerous government agencies and institutions . 
Official said the reasons for the discrepancies are : During the initial stage of the outbreak , some patients died at home due to lack of medical resources ; 
During the peak of the outbreak , medical workers were overwhelmed and focused mostly on treatment , resulting in late reporting , omissions and misreporting of data ; 
There was a rapid increase in the number of designated medical facilities , which were run by different levels of governments or private businesses , resulting in delayed reporting from certain medical institutions ; 
Incomplete information on certain death cases resulted in repetitive reporting or misreporting . 
China has faced increased scrutiny this week by the United States to be transparent in its reporting on the coronavirus pandemic . 
This post was updated to focus on the Wuhan death toll .
