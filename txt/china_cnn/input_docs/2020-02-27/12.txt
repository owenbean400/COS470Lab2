Foxconn , a major electronics maker and supplier to Apple , has started making surgical face masks for all of its factory workers . 
The Taiwanese tech giant said in a statement today that it had ramped up production significantly to meet its internal requirements of making approximately a million masks per day for employees at its facilities . 
" Having previously dealt with SARS , Foxconn has a good understanding of how to care for our employees ’ health and how we will need to allocate resources in the manufacturing and production departments , " the company told CNN Business earlier this month . 
Foxconn also announced this week that it had appointed Zhong Nanshan , a renowned respiratory scientist , as a chief consultant to the company as it continues to resume operations at facilities throughout China . 
Zhong is seen as one of the heroes in China ’s battle against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in 2003 , and is also currently leading the country ’s national research team on the novel coronavirus outbreak .
