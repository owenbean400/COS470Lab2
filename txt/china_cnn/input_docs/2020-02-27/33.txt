Life in Daegu , the city at the heart of South Korea 's outbreak , is mostly normal -- but people are not taking any chances , said Racheal Downey , an American teacher living there . 
The streets are a little emptier than normal , and everybody is wearing face masks , said Downey . 
" Everyone ’s for the most part taking the self quarantine advice seriously . " 
She 's taking precautions too -- she wore gloves today when going outside to the bank . 
" I ’m more concerned about the kids ’ safety more than anything , " she added . 
" If my employer decides to extend the closure of the school , then I will be okay with that decision as long as the kids remain safe . " 
Discrimination in the US : Downey also mentioned the reports of racial discrimination and harassment that have emerged in the United States , targeting people of East Asian or Chinese descent as fears of the coronavirus rise . 
" I really hope that this does not negatively affect immigrants and Asian Americans who are living back in the States . 
I hope that they do not see any signs of discrimination back home because of this , " she said .
