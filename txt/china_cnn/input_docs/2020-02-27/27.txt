Business travel could fall by more than a third during the coronavirus outbreak , according to a survey by an industry trade group . 
Most businesses surveyed said they are pulling back on at least some of their travel due to the virus . 
The Global Business Travel Association estimates that business spending on travel could fall by about $ 1.5 billion a day . 
That equates to $ 560 billion on an annual basis , or about 37 % of industry spending . 
It said a survey of 401 companies found nearly two thirds reported that they had canceled at least some already scheduled meetings , events or conferences due to concerns about the conferences . 
Most of the canceled trips are to China , Hong Kong or other locations in the Asia Pacific region . 
About a third of the companies surveyed have already canceled trips to Europe as well .
