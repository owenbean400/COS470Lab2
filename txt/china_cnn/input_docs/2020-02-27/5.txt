The 15th coronavirus case in the US , which was announced earlier on Wednesday , may be the first example in the country of " community spread , " where the patient did not have " relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient , " said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 
The patient is a resident of Solano County , California , and their " exposure is unknown . " 
What this means : Community spread means the virus begins moving through a community and the " source of the infection is unknown , " the agency said . 
" It â€™s also possible , however , that the patient may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected , " the CDC said . 
The patient is now being treated in Sacramento . 
US cases : There are 42 cases in the US that are passengers who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship , 14 cases who recently returned from China or are the spouse of a recent returnee , and three people who were repatriated from China , making the national total 60 cases .
