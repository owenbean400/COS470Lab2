Dr . Celine Gounder , a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the NYU School of Medicine , urged Americans to have plenty of hand sanitizer and a healthy supply of medications on hand as coronavirus fears grow . 
" I would definitely have some alcohol based hand sanitizer above 60 % alcohol content . 
You want to have it in your purse , in your backpack all over the place , " Gounder said on CNN today . 
She said the first thing you should do when you come home from school or work is to use that . 
Gounder also advises that you stock up on ibuprofen , Tylenol , or any prescription medications . 
For a lot of these products , either the ingredients that are used to make medications or the medications themselves are from China , so call your doctor if you are on prescription medications , and ask them for a 90 day supply instead of a 30 day . 
And make sure you have refills . 
" Have that stuff on hand . 
There may be some disruptions in supply as well as getting into your doctor 's office , " Gounder said .
