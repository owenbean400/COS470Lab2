Italy ’s Deputy Finance Minister Antonio Misiani said the four regions most affected by the coronavirus outbreak make up 50 % of the country ’s GDP . 
Misiani told CNN that so far , the outbreak has affected the sectors most connected to trade with China — manufacturing , luxury , and tourism . 
He added that it ’s too soon to say whether the situation will push Italy into recession . 
He continued : " Currently the most affected sectors are tourism and fairs , " he said . 
" The cancellations of reservations of the past few days are dictated by emotion . 
We are working to help these sectors with fiscal measures and social safety nets and to explain to the world that Italy is absolutely safe and has a public health system perfectly capable of managing this emergency .
