British traders are calling for rapid testing of truck drivers amid growing concerns that European truck drivers could stop delivering goods to the UK to avoid being " stranded . " 
It comes after France announced a 48 hour ban on UK travellers due to a new variant of coronavirus , prompting the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel to close . 
Richard Burnett , head of the UK Road Haulage Association said on BBC Radio Monday this could be a " deterrent " for European hauliers who do not want to end up " stranded " in the UK so close to Christmas . 
" I think that the retailers have done a very good job in terms of stock building [...] there will be plenty of stock but the fresh food supply , where it 's short shelf life and there will be product on its way now -- that 's where the challenge [...] comes from , " he said . 
Meanwhile , the spokeswoman for the French National Road Haulage Federation ( FNTR ) , Vanessa Ibarlucea , told CNN Monday the Dover Calais truck situation is " catastrophic . " 
" And on an economic level , because we have our drivers who do not want to go to the UK because of fear to not be able to come back as the borders are closed . 
It is going to cause an issue regarding the flows which are likely to stop , and therefore cause a drying up of supply across the Channel ahead of the Brexit day , " she added .
