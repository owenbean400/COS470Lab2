United Kingdom Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tried to calm fears that new transport restrictions could lead to goods shortages . 
After the UK announced that it had detected a new variant of the coronavirus , French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a 48 hour ban on the movement of people from the UK to France , starting Sunday night . 
Both the Port of Dover -- a key port between the UK and France -- and Eurotunnel , an underwater tunnel across the English Channel , have closed . 
But on Sky News on Monday , Shapps played down the impact . 
The port makes up around 20 % of goods going in and out of the country , and on a regular Monday , around 6,000 lorries would arrive in Kent , he said . 
While those wo not be able to continue , other crossings are open , he said . 
According to Shapps , most good arrive into the UK in unaccompanied containers . 
Shapps said that authorities were working to provide welfare for drivers , but added that it was important for the links not to be closed for too long .
