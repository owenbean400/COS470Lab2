Police in Kent are closing sections of England ’s M20 motorway to " avoid gridlock across Kent " after the closure of the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover . 
Kent is the English county closest to France . 
Operation Stack is being implemented on the coastbound motorway , the parts of the motorway where lorries usually queue before travelling to the continent , the Kent police said in a statement on Monday morning . 
The move closes these specific sections of the road to regular traffic , instead using them to house freight transport stranded at the crossing . 
Freight will be separated into two queues on either side of the coastbound carriageway , 1 for tunnel traffic and 1 for port traffic . 
The middle lanes are kept clear for emergency vehicles , the statement continued . 
The closure is an " emergency measure , " implemented by the Kent police and in consultation with other agencies . 
France announced on Sunday that it would not be accepting any passengers arriving from the UK for at least the next 48 hours after the UK announced that it had detected a new variant of coronavirus . 
Manston Airport in Kent is also being readied to take up to 4,000 lorries to ease disruption in the surrounding areas , England ’s Department for Transport said .
