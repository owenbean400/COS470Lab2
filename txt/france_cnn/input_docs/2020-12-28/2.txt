France ’s health minister says he cannot rule out the possibility of a third national lockdown . 
" We never rule out measures that might be necessary to protect populations , " Olivier Véran told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper on Sunday . 
" This does not mean that we have decided , but that we are observing the situation hour by hour , " he added . 
While the French government had previously announced its aim to reduce the daily increase in new coronavirus cases to 5,000 , this goal has yet to be achieved . 
8,822 new coronavirus cases were recorded Sunday . 
" The target of 5,000 [ daily cases ] is moving away , " Véran said . 
" We will be attentive to what we will observe in the next few days , " he added .
