A number of British tourists staying at the Swiss ski resort of Verbier are reported to have " fled clandestinely under cover of night " on Saturday , after a quarantine period was imposed on all travelers from the United Kingdom , a local official told CNN on Monday . 
The quarantine requirement was introduced amid concerns over a new , more contagious , coronavirus variant . 
" Some British tourists left immediately , while others decided to stay a little longer . 
Some of them fled clandestinely during the night , " Jean Marc Sandoz , spokesman for the town of Bagnes , some 20 minutes away from Verbier , told CNN . 
" They left progressively , as soon as they found a way back to their homes , " he added , noting that the exact number of tourists who left the resort has not been confirmed . 
On 21 December , the Swiss Federal Council imposed an entry ban and retroactive quarantine period on all travelers from the UK and South Africa , to prevent the spread of two newly detected variants of coronavirus . 
All those who have entered Switzerland from the two countries since 14 December are required to quarantine for 10 days . 
According to Sandoz , 370 holidaymakers from the UK were recorded as being required to comply with the 10 day quarantine order . 
" Some of them had to leave for France , because planes for the UK are suspended in Switzerland , " Sandoz said . 
" You ca not blame them . 
In most cases the quarantine was unbearable . 
Imagine staying with four people in a hotel room of 20 square metres , and they had to pay for staying at a Swiss ski resort , " he added . 
According to Head of the Verbier Tourism Office , Simon Wiget , British tourists usually make up 21 % of holidaymakers staying at the resort .
