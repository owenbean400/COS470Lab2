France has already closed 81 schools and 2,100 classes due to Covid 19 cases since the start of the school term this month , according to education minister Jean Michel Blanquer . 
In addition , Blanquer said about 1,200 new infections among students had been recorded since last week . 
" These are numbers that remain low , " Blanquer told French TV channel LCI on Wednesday . 
Blanquer said the 81 closed schools represented only 0.13 % of total schools in the country . 
France recorded more than 10,000 new virus cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic over the weekend . 
This week , the cities of Marseille and Bordeaux have tightened coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings in a bid to curb rising numbers of cases . 
The move comes after French Prime Minister Jean Castex addressed the nation on Friday , asking local authorities to present new measures and emphasizing that Marseille , Bordeaux and the Guadeloupe were particularly affected areas .
