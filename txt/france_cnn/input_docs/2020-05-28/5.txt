Parks will reopen in France starting Saturday , and beaches and lakes will reopen on June 2 , said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe today during a news conference in Paris . 
Philippe said gatherings must be limited to 10 people and the capacity of outdoor spaces will be limited to 5,000 people , under the condition that social distancing rules are enforced . 
Philippe added that it will be up to local mayors and regional officials to decide if masks should be mandatory for people visiting parks , beaches and lakes . 
Some context : Until now , parks were only open in regions where the coronavirus infection rate was low and hospitals ' intensive care units had low occupancy . 
Despite the relatively higher rate of infection in Paris , Mayor Anne Hidalgo had repeatedly pushed for parks to be reopened , asking the government to consider " the need of Parisians " living in a " very dense city . " 
Following the decision on Thursday , Hidalgo said in a tweet , " Finally ! 
Common sense prevailed in the end . 
Parisiens will be able to breathe once again , in parks and gardens , as early as this weekend . "
