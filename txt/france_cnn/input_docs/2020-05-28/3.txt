The French government supports reopening internal European borders from June 15 , French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Thursday during a press conference in Paris . 
Philippe said there would be no quarantine measures for European travelers arriving in France but the French government will take reciprocal measures for countries that decide to close their borders or impose a quarantine on French travelers . 
Currently , travel within France is also restricted , and people traveling for more than 62 miles ( 100km ) between departments are required to show a certificate proving they had a legal reason to travel . 
That " 100km rule " will be lifted on June 2 , allowing for unrestricted travel within France .
