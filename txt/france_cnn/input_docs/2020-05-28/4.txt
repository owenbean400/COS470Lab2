France will allow cultural and sports venues to gradually reopen beginning on June 2 , Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday . 
Museums and monuments , as well as indoor facilities such as theaters , concert halls , swimming pools and gyms will also be allowed to reopen on June 2 in " green zones , " where infection rates are low . 
Masks will be mandatory " for a certain number of these activities , " Philippe said . 
If businesses will qualify to enter into phase two will be determined by the infection rate in the region . 
For example , Paris is classified as an " orange zone " which means the " lifting of lockdown measures will be carried out slightly more cautiously , " Philippe said . 
Cinemas will reopen across France June 22 as well â€“ following a request from cinema operators who wished to coordinate reopenings nationally , Philippe said .
