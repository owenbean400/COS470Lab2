France is paying the price for ending the coronavirus lockdown too quickly , said Gilles Pialoux , the head of infectious diseases at Tenon Hospital in Paris . 
The country reported a new record for daily coronavirus infections on Thursday , with 41,622 new cases in a 24 hour period , according to numbers released by the French Health Agency . 
It will be " really difficult to avoid a ( second ) lockdown given the circulation of the virus , " Pialoux told BFM Friday . 
France is " paying for an end of lockdown that happened too quickly , a summer that was too careless , and a new school year that was not anticipated enough , " he added . 
He said local lockdowns or lockdowns " by population group " could be the solution . 
The doctor added the circulation of the virus among the " 20-30 year old " age group was " far beyond " the rest of the population . 
Martin Hirsch , the head of Paris Public Hospitals , said the second wave " could be worse than the first one . " 
Hirsch told RTL radio on Friday of a " fearsome " situation , calling on all French people to adapt their behaviors to combat the epidemic and prevent intensive care units from being saturated .
