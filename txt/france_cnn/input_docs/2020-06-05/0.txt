France ’s coronavirus epidemic is now " under control , " according to the head of France ’s government scientific advisory council . 
Jean François Delfraissy told France Inter radio station Friday that although the virus continued to circulate it was doing so at a " slow speed . " 
He said he was confident that France now had " all the tools to detect new cases . " 
Delfraissy attributed part of this slowdown to the widespread use of masks , saying that " the first step was to recognize that [ the authorities ] were lacking masks . " 
He also drew attention to the strain placed on the country by the Parisian outbreak , saying that the " majority of deaths and serious forms occurred in the Paris region , " which in turn imposed some of the strictest lockdown measures . 
The country ’s first epicenter was the eastern city of Mulhouse , where a cluster of cases was first recorded in February . 
Delfraissy said that if the Mulhouse cluster had not occurred , precipitating the virus ' spread across France , then the country " would be in a situation closer to Germany . " 
France is currently in its second phase of de confinement , with bars and restaurants reopening and a 100 kilometer ( 62 mile ) travel limit lifted . 
Despite the " human " need to unwind , Delfraissy advised French citizens " not to relax too much " as the country takes further steps toward normality .
