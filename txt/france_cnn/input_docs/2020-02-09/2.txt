A fourth case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been confirmed in the United Kingdom , the country 's chief medical adviser said in a statement on Sunday . 
" A further patient has tested positive for novel coronavirus in England , bringing the total number of cases in the UK to four , " Whitty said in the statement . 
" The new case is a known contact of a previously confirmed UK case , and the virus was passed on in France . " 
The patient was transferred to a specialist NHS center at The Royal Free Hospital in north London . 
France on Saturday confirmed five new cases of the virus in the country , all of them British nationals , including one 9 year old child . 
The child recently spent time in a school in the French Alps ski resort of Les Contamines Montjoie . 
His classmates will be tested for the virus , France ’s health minister Agnes Buzyn told reporters . 
" I ’ve met with them and their families to inform them on the ongoing procedures . 
Results should be known in the late afternoon or through the evening , depending on the time the tests were conducted . 
As soon as these results will be available , we will inform them on the upcoming procedures and follow up care accordingly , " she said . 
Two schools that the child attended in the area will shut down next week as a precaution , local officials said on Saturday . 
The five British nationals were infected after they came into contact with another UK citizen who had traveled from Singapore to the ski resort on January 24 for a four day trip , according to local health official Jean Yves Grall . 
That national has returned to the UK .
