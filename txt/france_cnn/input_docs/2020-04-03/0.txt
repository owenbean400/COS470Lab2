The fortress town of Zahara de la Sierra in southern Spain is used to fending off enemies . 
The Moors and Christians fought over it in medieval times , and it was sacked by the French in 1812 . 
Now its formidable position high above the Andalusian countryside has suddenly become an invaluable asset once more . 
On March 14 , Zahara cut itself off from the outside world as the coronavirus spread its tentacles across Spain . 
The mayor , 40 year old Santiago Galván , decided to block all but one of the town 's five entrances . 
Galván acted the day that Spain 's " state of alarm " came into force . 
In Zahara , however , there has not been a single recorded case of Covid 19 among its 1,400 inhabitants . 
" It has been more than two weeks , and I think that 's a good sign , " Galván told CNN . 
The mayor 's drastic steps have the full support of the townspeople , and especially the elderly . 
Nearly a quarter of Zahara 's inhabitants are older than 65 ; there are more than 30 residents in an old people 's home . 
Towns and villages nearby have seen infections and several coronavirus fatalities .
