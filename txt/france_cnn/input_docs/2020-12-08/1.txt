France recorded a rise in Covid 19 cases with more than 13,000 new infections on Tuesday , according to France ’s Public Health Agency . 
The increase in cases means France is getting further away from President Emmanuel Macron 's target of 5,000 or fewer daily cases , which is the government 's requirement to lift the lockdown . 
The average number of new daily cases in recent days was about 10,000 , France ’s public health agency chief said on Monday . 
With 804 new deaths recorded on Tuesday , fatalities were higher than Monday ’s toll of 366 . 
However , the number of deaths tends to be higher on Tuesdays and Fridays , when care homes share their data with public health authorities . 
On Tuesday , 3,078 patients were in intensive care units , which is a decrease of 110 patients compared to Monday and closer to the target of 3,000 ICU patients set by the government as a benchmark to lift restrictions . 
A total of 25,882 coronavirus patients remain hospitalized , which is a decrease of 451 compared to Monday .
