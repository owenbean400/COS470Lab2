Protesters in Paris have sprayed red paint over the front of the Health Ministry building to " symbolize those who lost their lives " to Covid 19 and to highlight the poor conditions for healthcare workers . 
Many of the demonstrators were part of the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and Citizen Action ( Attac ) , a left wing activist group . 
Around 30 demonstrators from Attac and Inter Urgences , an association of paramedical staff , took part in the protest . 
The two associations have criticized the French government â€™s treatment of health workers , including the country 's offer of a medal to medical staff . 
The French state 's offer of a bonus for medical workers , awarded using strict criteria , has also been criticized . 
The demonstration was the first by health workers since the easing of lockdown in France . 
" In the face of this indecency , healthcare staff have decided to show the real face of the government and its ministers by offering them the medal of contempt , " Attac 's statement added .
