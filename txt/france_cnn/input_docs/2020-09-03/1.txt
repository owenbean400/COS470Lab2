French prime minister Jean Castex says country 's recovery plan , worth 100 billion euro ( about $ 118 billion USD ) , is the " biggest stimulus package of all European countries . " 
Speaking after a cabinet meeting , he said the value is the equivalent of 4 % of France ’s GDP and four times larger than the stimulus package put in place after the 2008 financial crisis . 
The plan — which was announced today and is called " Restart France " — includes 70 measures centered around three major themes : ecological transition ( 30 billion euros ) , business competitiveness ( 35 billion euros ) and social and territorial cohesion ( 35 billion euros ) . 
The plan has a clear emphasis on a green transition of the economy with 11 billion euros for the transport sector including 4.7 billion for improvements of the rail network and 6 billion earmarked for energy efficient building renovations including 2 billion for peoples ’ homes . 
The hydrogen industry — seen as a key in the transition away from fossil fuels - is set to get two billion euro as part of the two year stimulus plan . 
Castex said the stimulus package would generate 160,000 new jobs by the end of next year . 
The prime minister said no extra household or corporate tax would be levied to pay for this plan but that 40 % or 40 billion euros would come from the 750 billion euro EU recovery fund .
