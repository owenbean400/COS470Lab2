The French government has announced that it will extend its " partial unemployment " scheme for people working in the tourism sector . 
The scheme supports those unable to work during the pandemic , with those enrolled receiving up to 84 % of their after tax salary from the state . 
The program was due to end in September but will be extended to December for tourism workers , France â€™s deputy minister for tourism , Jean Baptiste Lemoyne , said Wednesday in an interview with France Info . 
" Tourism professionals need long term support ; for some it will be a lost year , " Lemoyne said . 
The scheme was first introduced during the lockdown in March to help companies cope with a decline in activity . 
The French tourism sector has suffered greatly due to the pandemic 's impact on travel . 
France has also announced bailout packages for its embattled car industry and aviation industry .
