Covid 19 is spreading in " one big wave " and is not affected by seasonal trends , according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) spokesperson Margaret Harris . 
Coronavirus spikes recorded in European countries recently have typically been described as second waves . 
But Harris characterised the virus as " one big wave " that " is going to go up and down a bit , " while addressing a virtual press briefing in Geneva Tuesday . 
She also said Covid 19 did not appear to follow the seasonal trends of viruses such as influenza . 
The WHO spokesperson also warned against complacency , while speaking to Irish radio station Newstalk Tuesday . 
" People unfortunately interpreted the ending of lockdowns as the ending of outbreaks , " she said , adding that the easing of lockdown was " the time when you really have to be most vigilant . " 
" People relaxed and we 're seeing these upticks , " Harris said . 
Coronavirus cases are rising in Germany , France and Spain , while spikes in Hong Kong and Australia have also been recorded . 
Harris said the message to stay vigilant was a difficult one to deliver , especially to young people " in the middle of a lovely summer . " 
" You 're only young once . 
It 's easy for oldies like me to say stay at home . 
You 've also only got one life and you 've also only got one family , " she said . 
" What we do see is that in the European region there has been a slight uptick in new cases in the past couple of weeks , " WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge , said during an interview with BBC Radio 4 Wednesday . 
" Whether this is a first wave or a second wave -- what we do know is that it â€™s a consequence of change in human behavior . " 
The official also noted that the WHO had received reports " from civil and health authorities of a higher proportion of new infections among young people . " 
Kluge said he was " cautiously optimistic " about the virus but warned that the pandemic was " not going to fade away anytime soon . "
