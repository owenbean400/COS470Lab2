The 130,000 French citizens currently stranded abroad must show " patience " as the government is trying to ensure they can return to the country , Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said Friday . 
Le Drian said the government was working on enabling their return " as fast as possible " but did not give an exact deadline . 
French nationals who travel back to France would still be expected to pay for their ticket , he added . 
Le Drian also encouraged French citizens living abroad to stay in their country of residence .
