New research published Thursday suggests that Covid 19 causes more severe disease than seasonal flu across many metrics . 
The death rate for hospitalized Covid 19 patients was three times higher than the death rate for hospitalized flu patients , according to the study . 
Rates of respiratory failure were also higher in Covid 19 patients than in flu patients . 
The research , which appeared in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine , examined data from more than 130,000 French patients hospitalized with either Covid 19 or the flu . 
Data from Covid 19 patients was compared to data collected through the 2018-2019 flu season . 
In addition to differences in health outcomes , hospital stays varied between those with Covid 19 and the flu . 
More Covid 19 patients than flu patients needed intensive care , and those with Covid 19 spent on average twice as much time in intensive care than flu patients . 
Looking at data from children , those under 18 were hospitalized less frequently from Covid 19 than from influenza , but children under five who were hospitalized with Covid 19 needed intensive care at greater rates than those with flu . 
Researchers suggested that immunity , either natural immunity or vaccinations , may account for some of the difference , underscoring the need for Covid 19 prevention .
