France will replace its traditional Bastille Day parade down the Champs Élysées in Paris with a smaller military ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic , the Minister of Armed Forces , Florence Parly , said Friday . 
The July 14 ceremony will be a scaled down celebration and will include a tribute to health care workers . 
An Elysée spokesperson told CNN that the gathering in Paris would be about half the size , reduced to 2,000 participants and about 2,500 guests . 
" An air parade will honour the participation of our armies in the fight against Covid 19 , through Operation Resilience , in which our armed forces have helped for instance in the repatriation and displacement of ill people , " the spokesperson said . 
Parly tweeted the parade is a " moment of union and pride " and " because the 2020 edition will pay tribute to the caregivers , " the celebrations will go ahead on a smaller scale .
