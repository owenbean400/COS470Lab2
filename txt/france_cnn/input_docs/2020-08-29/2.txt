It 's set to be a Tour de France like no other . 
Watched on television by millions across the world , the annual race is deeply embedded in French culture as it weaves its way across stunning countryside and vertiginous mountains , as well as through picturesque towns and cities before concluding on Paris ' Champs Elys√©es .
