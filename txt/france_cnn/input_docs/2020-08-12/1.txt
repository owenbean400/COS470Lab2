France has recorded its biggest jump in daily Covid 19 cases since around the time it began to ease its lockdown . 
The French health ministry on Wednesday reported an increase of 2,524 Covid 19 cases in 24 hours . 
This is the biggest single day increase in coronavirus cases since May 6 , five days before France eased lockdown restrictions . 
This rise comes after French Prime Minister Jean Castex said Tuesday that the coronavirus situation in France has been " trending in the wrong direction . "
