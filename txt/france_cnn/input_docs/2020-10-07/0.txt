Covid 19 patients now fill 40 % of all intensive care unit beds in the Paris region , which is struggling to contain a widening outbreak of the virus , according to a spokesperson for the city 's health authority . 
That 's a 10 % jump in 10 days . 
In an effort to suppress the city 's surging infection rates , the French government raised Paris ' coronavirus alert level to maximum on Tuesday , closing caf√©s , bars , gyms and swimming pools for two weeks . 
There are currently 2,393 people being treated for the coronavirus in Paris hospitals , 449 of whom are in intensive care -- approximately double the numbers from two weeks ago . If hospital admissions continue at that pace , about 1,000 patients could be in intensive care by the end of October , according to calculations from the Paris public hospital group ( AP HP ) and published by the Paris region health authority . 
As of Tuesday night , there were 1,426 patients being treated in intensive care across France . 
That compares with only 420 patients a month ago .
