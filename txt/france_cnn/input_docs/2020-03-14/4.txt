French Prime Minister Ã‰douard Philippe announced on Saturday that his country will increase social distancing to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic . 
In a televised press conference , Philippe said that starting at midnight Saturday all places that are not essential to French living , including restaurants , cafes , cinemas and clubs , will be closed . 
The closure order includes all businesses except those that are essential . 
Philippe acknowledged that the French people find the concept of social distancing repugnant , " because we are a people that likes to gather , a joyful people , a people that likes to live together ... 
Maybe even more when fear starts to spread . " 
" We have seen too many people in cafes and restaurants . 
In usual times , this would make me happy . 
Because this is the France we all love . 
But for a few weeks , this is not what we should be doing , " Philippe added .
