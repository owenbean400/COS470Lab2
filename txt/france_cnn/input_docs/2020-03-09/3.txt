The French Central Bank , or Banque de France , downgraded its growth forecast for the first quarter from + 0.3 % down to + 0.1 % -- a steep drop that suggests the coronavirus is now hitting European economies beyond Italy . 
A statement from Francois Villeroy de Galhau , governor of the bank , cites " strong uncertainty about future production linked to coronavirus " for the revised forecast . 
The bank also urged calm : The statement asked the public to " have our eyes wide open but keep a cool head . " 
" Getting over this shock depends on us , together , " it added .
