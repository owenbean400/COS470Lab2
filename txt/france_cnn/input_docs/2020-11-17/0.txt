California officials are considering a curfew as the state grapples with the rapid spread of coronavirus . 
Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said a curfew is just one of the ideas being researched and officials are figuring out what it might look like in California . 
It ’s unclear what they have in mind , but a curfew could be implemented statewide , or may just accompany one or more of the state ’s four restriction tiers which are determined county by county . 
Los Angeles County officials are specifically considering a curfew , " so businesses do not have to close again , but would instead have limited hours for essential activities , " according to County Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas . 
Data presented by the county ’s health director shows young people are accounting for more and more of the cases , while the elderly are suffering the most serious effects . 
California would not be the first state to employ a curfew : A newly implemented curfew in Massachusetts keeps residents at home between the hours of 10 p.m . and 5 a.m . New York City businesses with liquor licenses must close by 10 p.m . Virginia has implemented an alcohol related curfew , prohibiting on site sale , consumption , and possession after 10 p.m . at restaurants , breweries , and wineries . 
Newsom ’s team is evaluating studies from France , Germany and Saudi Arabia . 
The team is examining the efficacy of a curfew while assessing how they are working in other areas .
