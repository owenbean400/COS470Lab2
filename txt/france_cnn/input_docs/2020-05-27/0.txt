French doctors have been banned from prescribing hydroxychloroquine to Covid 19 patients , the government ruled Wednesday . 
The French Health Ministry revoked its authorization for the drug to be given to those with coronavirus , saying that the scientific data available at present does not provide sufficient " evidence of a benefit " to support its use . 
Data considered by France ’s High Council for Public Health found evidence to suggest a link between the use of hydroxychloroquine and " cardiac toxicity , " particularly when used in combination with the azithromycin – an antibiotic used to treat chest infection and other types of infection , according to a Health Ministry statement . 
It added that the benefits and risks of this treatment may be reassessed in the future , as new data from clinical research emerges . 
Some context : The announcement comes after the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on Monday said it had temporarily halted the study of hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid 19 treatment in its Solidarity Trial , due to safety concerns . 
The WHO ’s decision was made after an observational study , published in the medical journal The Lancet on Friday , described how seriously ill Covid 19 patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were more likely to die or develop irregular heart rhythms .
