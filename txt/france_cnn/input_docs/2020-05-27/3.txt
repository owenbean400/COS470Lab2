Both chambers of the French Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Stop Covid smartphone application on Wednesday , despite the contact tracing app being decried by opposition parties for its infringements on individual freedoms . 
The vote was purely symbolic and was meant to let French President Emmanuel Macron 's government know that there was political backing for the Stop Covid app . 
After hours of debate , Stop Covid was adopted at the National Assembly with 338 votes in favor and 215 votes against . 
Around midnight , the French Senate voted in favor of the government app by 189 votes in favor to 129 against . 
The app had already been given the green light by the National Commission for Digital Freedom on Tuesday . 
A spokesperson for the National Assembly told CNN on Wednesday that the government " did not need a legal basis in order to deploy the app , because it works on a purely voluntary basis and does not infringe on personal freedom . " 
French digital rights association La Quadrature du Net said that between 60 % and 80 % of the population would need to use the app for it to be useful in the fight against coronavirus .
