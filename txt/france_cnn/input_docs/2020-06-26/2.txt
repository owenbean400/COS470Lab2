The British government will announce travel agreements with countries , such as France , Greece and Spain , next week as it reviews its policy of imposing a 14 day quarantine for travelers arriving in Britain , the UK government said in a statement on Friday . 
" Countries have been classified as green , amber and red depending on their risk assessment , informed by factors including the prevalence of coronavirus within the country , our confidence in the reliability of their data , and crucially the trajectory of the disease in the country , " the statement read . 
" Low risk countries in the green and amber categories will be exempt from public health measures at the border . " 
A full list of the low risk countries will be published next week and travel to those destinations will be able to resume the following week . 
" Our new risk assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world â€” giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business , " a government spokesperson said . 
" But we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if any risks re emerge , and this system will enable us to take swift action to re introduce self isolation measures if new outbreaks occur overseas . "
