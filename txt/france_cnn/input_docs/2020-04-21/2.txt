Amazon will extend its shutdown in France until at least April 25 , the company said on Tuesday . 
Amazon announced it was shutting down its distribution centers last Wednesday following a court ruling that ordered it to restrict its local delivery operations to essential goods only . 
" The company will reevaluate its position once the appeal court ruling is given on Friday , April 24th , " Amazon said in a statement in Tuesday . 
Amazon employees will continue receiving their full salary , the statement added . 
Remember : France suspended all non essential business last month , a measure that is set to remain in place until May 11 . 
The French court also required that the company carry out an assessment of the " occupational risks inherent in the Covid 19 epidemic " in all of its warehouses .
