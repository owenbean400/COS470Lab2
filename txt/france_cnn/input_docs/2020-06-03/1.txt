The Dutch government announced Wednesday that it will allow citizens to travel abroad for vacation to a large number of European countries , and will also allow some foreign tourists to come to the Netherlands . 
The policy goes into effect on June 15 . 
The government will continue to advise against nonessential travel to the United Kingdom and Sweden , " because the health risks there are estimated to be higher . " 
Travel outside Europe will still be " discouraged . " 
Starting on June 15 , the Dutch government will lower its health travel warnings for Belgium , Bulgaria , Germany , Estonia , Italy , Croatia , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Portugal , Slovenia , the Czech Republic , and the Dutch islands of the Caribbean . 
France and Spain have yet to make a decision about whether Dutch tourists will be welcomed , the government said , and Denmark has already made clear that it does not want Dutch tourists . 
The government said that it would welcome " foreign tourists from countries with similar or lower health risks as in our country . " 
The government uses a three level , color coded scale of yellow , orange , and red , to indicate the health risk of a foreign country . 
" It will therefore be a different summer vacation than usual , " Rutte said . 
" The main advice is to think carefully about what you do , and if you do go on vacation , travel wisely . "
