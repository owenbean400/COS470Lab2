France has received 30 million protective face masks to help healthcare workers treat patients infected by the coronavirus , French Minister for Health Olivier Véran said Thursday . 
He advised against use by the general public , and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe reiterated that face masks were " useless " for day to day protection and deprived healthcare workers who needed them . 
Meanwhile , the French lockdown that began this week is likely to last beyond the forecast two weeks , according to Geneviève Chêne , the director general of Public Health France . 
Chêne told French radio station France Info on Thursday that France should start to see " a major slowdown within two to four weeks " but that the primary objective remained the conservation of the healthcare system . 
She said that it was " likely to be necessary to extend the confinement so that this slowdown is sufficient . " 
French President Emmanuel Macron announced lockdown plans in a televised address on Monday evening . 
From Tuesday midday local time , residents were instructed to stay at home . 
Those who wish to leave their home must carry a signed copy of a government approved certificate permitting certain activities such as buying groceries or visiting the sick .
