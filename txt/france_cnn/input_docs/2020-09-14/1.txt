France 's daily count of coronavirus infections dipped slightly on Sunday , a day after the country recorded more than 10,000 new cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic . 
There were 7,183 new cases on Sunday , according to health authorities , down from Saturday â€™s record breaking number of 10,561 . 
However a nationwide lockdown is not in the French government 's " mindset " despite the " clear deterioration " of the coronavirus situation , said Prime Minister Jean Castex in a televised address on Friday . 
Castex said he is " particularly worried " to see " a substantial increase in hospitalizations for the first time in a number of weeks . " 
The Prime Minister said a national lockdown should be avoided and gave power to local authorities to impose restrictions instead of the central government . 
" Measures should not be decided from Paris , " said Castex , explaining that the virus is spreading unevenly . 
Marseille , Bordeaux , and Guadeloupe are particularly badly affected , he added . 
Local authorities have until Monday to present measures to the Prime Minister . 
Castex also announced changes to the French government 's testing and isolation strategy . 
In face of the " significant waiting times " the priority will be to test people showing symptoms , those who were in close contact with coronavirus patients , and healthcare personnel , Castex said . 
" France has become the third European country in terms of testing , " he added , with around a million tests per week . 
Castex also announced the mandatory isolation period for people with Covid 19 will be reduced from 14 to 7 days , a " period where there is a real risk of contagion , " he said . 
" Tomorrow depends on you , tomorrow depends on us , " said Castex .
