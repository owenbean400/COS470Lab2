The French government is extending a ban on mass gatherings of 5,000 people or more until Oct . 30 , Prime Minister Jean Castex said Tuesday . 
Local authorities can request an exemption to the ban , Castex explained while speaking after a visit to a hospital in the city of Montpellier . 
This decision comes as " the coronavirus epidemic has deteriorated over the last few days , " Castex warned . 
Deploring a " weaker vigilance , weaker discipline and weaker solidarity " from a part of the population , the prime minister also called to extend the obligation to wear masks in outdoor public spaces . 
The decision on mass gatherings reverses a previous decision announced on Aug . 4 from the Culture Ministry , which said that cultural events in France of 5,000 people or more would be able to resume from Sept . 1 .
