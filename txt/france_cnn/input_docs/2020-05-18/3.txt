Young patients hospitalized with coronavirus related multi system inflammatory syndrome in children , or MIS C , recovered rapidly after treatment with immune globulin and steroids , according to a new study . 
In the small analysis , researchers in France and Switzerland reviewed data from 35 children between the ages of 2 and 16 hospitalized in intensive care between late March and the end of April with symptoms including " fever , cardiogenic shock or acute left ventricular dysfunction with inflammatory state . " 
Of the children in the study , 31 tested positive for coronavirus and none had underlying cardiovascular disease ; 
17 % of patients were overweight ; all experienced unusual lethargy ; and 83 % exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms . 
Almost all of the patients needed respiratory assistance , the researchers said . 
Most of the children received intravenous immune globulin treatment , a blood product made up of antibodies to help strengthen the body â€™s immune system . 
Twelve were also treated with steroids and 23 were treated with a therapeutic dose of the blood thinner heparin , the researchers reported . 
None of the patients studied died , Damien Bonnet of the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris and colleagues wrote . 
The study also concluded that , while MIS C shares similarities with atypical Kawasaki disease , " prominent clinical signs are largely different . " 
While the early signs of the syndrome may be severe with some patients needing help breathing and keeping their blood circulating , most recovered rapidly after treatment with immune globulin and steroids .
