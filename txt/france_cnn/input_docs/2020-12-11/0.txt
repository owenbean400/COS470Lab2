British and French pharmaceutical giants Glaxo Smith Kline and Sanofi Pasteur said Friday the release of their coronavirus vaccine would be delayed until late 2021 after interim results showed " insufficient immune response " in the elderly . 
" Insufficient response in older adults demonstrates the need to refine the concentration of antigen in order to provide high level immune response across all age groups , " a joint press release on their websites read . 
Thomas Triomphe , head of Sanofi Pasteur , said the companies were " disappointed by the delay announced today , " adding that they " have identified the path forward . " 
" No single pharma company can make it alone ; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic , " Triomphe said . 
Roger Connor , President of GSK Vaccines added : " The results of the study are not as we hoped , " and that it was now " clear that multiple vaccines will be needed to contain the pandemic . " 
The two companies said they are now planning a new phase 2b study with an improved antigen formulation in February of next year , which could be followed by a global phase 3 study potentially starting in Q2 2021 . 
The phase 3 studies were initially expected to start this month . 
GSK and Sanofi said positive results from these phases " would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021 , hence delaying the vaccine â€™s potential availability from mid 2021 to Q4 2021 . " 
The two drug makers said they have updated governments and the European Commission on the delay " where a contractual commitment to purchase the vaccine has been made . " 
This summer , the French and British giants won a commitment from the US federal government to pay up to $ 2.1 billion to help them move forward with their proposed joint coronavirus vaccine , as part of Operation Warp Speed .
