Air France says it will cut 7,580 jobs " following the Covid 19 crisis which has hit the group hard " and the lasting decline in air travel . 
The group said it will cut 6,560 jobs at Air France ( out of a current total of 41,000 ) by the end of 2022 . 
At least 1,020 jobs will be cut over the next three years at HOP ! , Air France â€™s subsidiary low cost domestic carrier , out of 2,420 current positions . 
Air France said that the 7 billion euros ( $ 7.9 billion ) it received in government support will enable the group " to withstand the crisis in the short term and is accompanied by strong commitments to ensure its sustainability " but that it has to accelerate its transformation to regain its competitiveness . 
Air France and HOP ! are working together with the unions to implement plans that give priority to voluntary departures , early retirement arrangements and professional and geographical mobility , according to the press release shared with CNN . 
The company said roughly 3,700 of the cuts can be achieved through normal departure of staff , mainly due to retirement . 
This the second blow for the French aviation industry this week . 
Airbus said on Tuesday it will cut 15,000 jobs globally , including 5,000 in France .
