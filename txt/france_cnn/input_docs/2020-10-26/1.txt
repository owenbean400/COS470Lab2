France may have an estimated 100,000 new Covid 19 cases per day , according to Jean Fran√ßois Delfraissy , who leads the scientific council that advises the French government . 
Speaking to France 's RTL radio on Monday morning , Delfraissy said , " There are probably over 50,000 cases per day . " 
However , the scientific council estimates that the reality is around 100,000 daily cases , " because beyond diagnosed cases there are many not diagnosed and asymptomatic cases , " Delfraissy said . 
He added that France is in a " very difficult , even critical , situation . " 
" This second wave is probably going to be stronger than the first wave , " he said , adding that the governing council 's main objectives going forward are to protect the most vulnerable people from coronavirus and protect the economy . 
On Sunday , the French Health Authority reported its highest daily increase in Covid 19 cases with 52,010 new infections . 
The most recent figures also show that of all the intensive care unit ( ICU ) patients , half of them are people ill with Covid 19 . 
That proportion is even more alarming in the Paris region where 65.5 % of ICU beds were occupied by Covid patients . 
There are currently 2,575 people currently in ICU in France -- double the number than in early October .
