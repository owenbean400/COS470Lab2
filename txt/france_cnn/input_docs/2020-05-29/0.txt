Renault is slashing 14,600 jobs as part of a major overhaul designed to reduce costs and help the French carmaker survive the coronavirus pandemic . 
Some 4,600 positions will be eliminated in France , with 10,000 more in other markets . 
The company announced Friday that it will cut costs by more than 2 billion euros ( $ 2.2 billion ) over the next three years . 
It also plans to reduce the number of cars it makes each year from 4 million to 3.3 million by 2024 , and will stop selling Renault branded vehicles in China . 
Renault ( RNLSY ) is part of the world 's biggest carmaking alliance , alongside Nissan ( NSANF ) and Mitsubishi ( MBFJF ) . 
Earlier this week , the companies announced they would make fewer models , share production facilities and focus on the existing geographic and technological strengths of each carmaker as they try to slash costs amid the pandemic . 
Renault said changes were needed because of the scale of the economic fallout from the pandemic , as well as stricter emissions standards . 
The company , which employs 180,000 people around the world , said it would consult with unions about restructuring some of its plants in France .
