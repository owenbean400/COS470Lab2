An infectious disease specialist has warned that France should brace itself for a coronavirus outbreak comparable to what Italy is currently facing . 
Authorities in Italy are struggling to contain the virus , which has infected more than 370 people and left 12 dead there . 
There are just 16 confirmed cases in France , but Professor of Infectious and Tropical Diseases at the Pitié Salpêtrièr hospital in Paris , Eric Caumes says he expects the situation to worsen given the " many channels of transmission " already circulating in the population . 
" Even if the severity is probably much weaker than we imagined , it probably transmits much better than we imagined , " he said , addressing the press alongside French President Emmanuel Macron , who was visiting Pitié Salpêtrièr . 
The hospital is where France ’s first coronavirus patient , a 60 year old man from the l ’Oise region , died . 
He is one of two people to have died in the country . 
Macron paid tribute to the hospital staff , saying the death " very much touched the team . " 
" I count on you and you can count on me so that we can work together and respond , " Macron told medical staff .
