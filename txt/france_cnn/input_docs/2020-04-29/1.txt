Spain , one of the world ’s top travel destinations , should not fully restart its tourism industry until the European Union reopens its internal and external borders , a senior Spanish government official said on Wednesday . 
Some 200 German owners of holiday homes on Spain ’s Mediterranean islands such as Mallorca and Ibiza , wrote to the regional president this month , requesting they be allowed back to their properties as soon as Spain ’s lockdown is lifted . 
A spokesperson for the Balearic regional government president , Francina Armengol , provided CNN with a copy of the reply she sent to the German homeowners , saying that Spain is working on reopening , but its first priority is " the safety of people and avoiding the expansion of the virus . " 
Spain has the second highest number of coronavirus cases in the world , after the United States . 
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic , Spain was the world ’s second biggest international tourist destination , with 83 million visitors , just behind France , the UN ’s World Tourism Organization reported for 2018 , the most recent figures available . 
The Covid 19 outbreak served a blow to Spain ’s tourism sector , which is 12.3 % of GDP and accounts for 2.6 million jobs , according to the Tourism Ministry .
