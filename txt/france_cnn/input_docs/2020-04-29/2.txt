Juventus striker Paulo Dybala has tested positive for the coronavirus for the fourth time in six weeks , a source close to the player has told CNN . 
The source said : " He is doing well now , he has no symptoms and is even training . 
Now he is waiting for the results of the latest two swabs . " 
It is unclear , though , when each of Dybala ’s tests took place CNN has contacted Juventus for comment . 
The Argentine striker announced on Instagram on Saturday 21 March that he and his girlfriend Oriana Sabatini had contracted Covid 19 after his first test . 
On Friday , March 27 , Dybala spoke to Juventus ’ official You Tube account about his experience of contracting the disease : " I developed strong symptoms , but today I already feel much better . 
" Now I can move better , walking and trying to train . 
I could hardly breathe , I could not do anything after five minutes . 
My muscles ached . 
Fortunately , Oriana and I are better now . " 
Dybala was one of three Juventus stars to contract the virus , along with Italian defender Daniele Rugani and French midfielder Blaise Matuidi . 
The club announced earlier this month that both Rugani and Matuidi had made full recoveries after their swab tests came back with negative results .
