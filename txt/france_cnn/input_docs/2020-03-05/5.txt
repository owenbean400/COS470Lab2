Portuguese airline TAP has announced it will cancel 1,000 flights between March and April over fears surrounding the coronavirus outbreak , the airline said today in a statement . 
The cancellations – which represents 4 % of TAP ’s global operations in March and 6 % in April – follow a " strong slowdown " in the world ’s economy following the COVID 19 outbreak and " lower demand " for flights , the airline said . 
According to TAP , the cancellations will focus on flights heading to the " most affected regions , " including Italy , Spain and France , but will also include some intercontinental flights . 
TAP said it continues to prioritize " the protection of the health " of its passengers and employees .
