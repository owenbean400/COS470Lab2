The European outbreak first took hold in Italy , but has now spread across the continent . 
The European Union ( EU ) has raised the risk level from moderate to high , warning that every country needs to prepare for the outbreak . 
In Italy , cities and towns in the north have been placed under full or partial shutdown , effectively quarantining 100,000 people . 
Schools are suspended , public spaces like swimming pools or parks are closed , and major events closed to reduce the risk of infection . 
An Italian government task force is working around the clock to manage confirmed cases , oversee nationwide health procedures , and work with international agencies like the WHO and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control . 
Elsewhere in the EU , deaths linked to the virus have been reported in France and Spain , which have over 400 cases combined . 
International travel restrictions have been put into place -- for instance , countries and airlines from the US to Kenya have suspended flights to Italy -- but EU borders remain open , with EU health ministers warning that border closures would be a " disproportionate and ineffective measure . " 
EU member countries have come together for a broader coordinated response , with an EU task force that covers responses in the medical field , mobility and travel , and economic impact . 
The United Kingdom also formed a " battle plan " against the virus , and has rolled out virus testing across 12 labs nationwide . 
Nearly 14,000 people have been tested across the UK so far .
