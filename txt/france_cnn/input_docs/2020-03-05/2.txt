England ’s Six Nations rugby union game against Italy that was due to played in Rome on March 14 has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak , an England Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) spokesperson has confirmed to CNN . 
The spokesperson added that it was too early to determine a new date for the fixture . 
The game was scheduled to be the last match for both teams in this year ’s Six Nations Championship , an annual international rugby union competition between England , France , Ireland , Italy , Scotland and Wales . 
It is the second game of this year ’s edition to be postponed . 
Ireland ’s clash with Italy in Dublin , which was due to be played this coming Saturday , had already been called off on public health grounds by Six Nations organizers . 
Thursday ’s decision comes after an Italian government decree issued on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of all sporting events in 11 " red zone " municipalities most affected by coronavirus -- Bertonico , Casalpusterlengo , Castelgerundo , Castiglione d 'Adda , Codogno , Fombio , Maleo , San Fiorano , Somaglia , Terranova dei Passerini and Vò . 
Outside those municipalities -- in the regions of Emilia Romagna , Lombardy and Veneto , among other locations -- sports competitions and training would be permitted only behind closed doors . 
Sports fans from the affected regions have also been barred from traveling to other regions .
