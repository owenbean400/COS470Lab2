Parks and public gardens in Paris will remain closed , French Health Ministry Olivier Veran said Tuesday . 
This comes after Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo asked for the green spaces to be reopened if visitors wear face masks . 
" Considering the need of Parisians , Paris is a very dense city , I ’m asking again for a reopening of parks and gardens " she said on Twitter Tuesday . 
Veran said Tuesday he had seen video of people gathering on the Seine river banks Monday and although that ’s a " reflex which can be understood " he stressed that it was also dangerous . 
" No we will not open parks and gardens in Paris , in the Parisian region or in any other region classified as red " he added . 
Since April 28 , France has been classified into green zones where the infection rate and ICU occupancy is low , and red zones where it is higher . 
Green zones , unlike the red ones , were able to start reopening parks and public gardens on May 11 .
