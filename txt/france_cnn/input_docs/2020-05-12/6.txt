No one quite knows what aviation will look like in the wake of the Covid 19 pandemic . 
There 's talk of removing middle seats , compulsory face masks and full body disinfection booths at airports -- and aviation seat designers are experimenting with ways to make flying more appealing for concerned and conscientious passengers . 
Into the mix comes French aeronautical engineer Florian Barjot 's vision , dubbed Plan Bay . 
Barjot reckons that what airlines want is not a total redesign of the cabin or the installation of new seats , but an easily removable piece of kit that could be installed when necessary . 
Plan Bay , which is aimed at economy class , consists of a protection panel behind the seat and another protection panel between the seats . 
The structure fits onto the empty middle seat , so passengers in the aisle and window can maintain social distance from one another . 
It 's not unlike the glass panel setup that business travelers might be used to . 
According to Barjot , the installation process is straightforward , the kit is easy to produce and the cost would be low . 
" The idea of a removable kit makes sense when the need for sanitary measures is temporary and/or limited to a geographic area , " says Barjot .
