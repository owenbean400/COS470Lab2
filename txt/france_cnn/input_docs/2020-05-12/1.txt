Nearly five months after the novel coronavirus first emerged in China , countries around the world are slowly starting to ease restrictions and lift lockdowns , moving from containment and mitigation to recovery . 
In Wuhan , the capital of China 's Hubei province at ground zero for the global pandemic , daily life has cautiously resumed . 
People who have been cleared with good health are now allowed to travel and work , while city and provincial borders have reopened . 
But as restrictions eases , fears of a second wave remain . 
Five new local transmissions were reported in Wuhan yesterday , a day after the city reported its first new case in more than a month . 
Some parts of Spain are entering " Phase 1 " of lifting restrictions , which allows many shops to reopen , and restaurants that have outdoor seating and service . 
In these areas of the country , like the Costa Blanca holiday spot Benidorm , people flocked to bars and outdoor areas to celebrate the lifting of lockdown on Monday . 
Other harder hit cities like Madrid and Barcelona remain in the stricter " Phase Zero " quarantine . 
France eased lockdown measures on Monday for the first time in more than 50 days . 
In Paris , traffic returned to the Champs Elysees , shops reopened , and people strolled the streets -- marking a return to some aspects of normal life . 
The banks of the River Seine were full of people sharing drinks and gathering with friends on Monday , eager to be back out after weeks spent cooped up . 
And in Shanghai , the city 's Disneyland finally reopened this week after being closed for months -- but with new rules , like markers on the floor to show visitors how to conduct social distancing . 
Hand sanitizers are everywhere , and there is a cap on the number of daily visitors .
