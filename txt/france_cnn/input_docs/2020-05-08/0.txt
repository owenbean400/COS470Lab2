Amazon France is planning to take the case over the shutdown of its distribution centers to the French Supreme Court , the company said in a statement . 
A Paris court ruled last month that Amazon had to stop selling anything but essential items while the company reassessed how it was keeping its warehouse employees safe from coronavirus . 
The case stemmed from a complaint brought by a French labor union . 
Amazon had appealed the decision but lost . 
After the court ruling , Amazon shut its French distribution centers on April 15 , saying the move was due to the complexity of its logistics system and what it called confusing instructions from the court with the risk of hefty fines . 
The company yesterday announced the warehouses will remain closed through next Wednesday , but all staff will continue to be paid .
