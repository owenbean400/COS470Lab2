Data from hospitals in the Paris region is not looking positive , the head of the Paris region health authority said Wednesday on French radio France Inter . 
Aurelien Rousseau said 34 % of ICU beds are occupied by Covid patients in the Paris region , with 30 % ICU Covid bed occupancy for the city of Paris . 
He added the incidence rate is very high for 20 - to 30 year old with 450 cases per 100,000 people . 
Rousseau said the incidence rate for people over the age of 65 is over 100 per 100,000 inhabitants . 
With worsening numbers , the government may decide that Paris , like Marseille and the overseas department of Guadeloupe , become a zone of " maximum alert , " meaning bars and restaurants close . 
The French minister of Health , Olivier Veran is expected to announce an update of measures in a press conference before the end of the week . 
Many bars and restaurant owners in Paris fear closure and the economic impact .
