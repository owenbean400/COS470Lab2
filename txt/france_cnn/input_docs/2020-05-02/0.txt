The French government will extend a state of emergency over coronavirus for around two months in a set of measures to be proposed to Parliament on Tuesday , Health Minister Olivier Véran said in a press conference today . 
Following a cabinet meeting over the coronavirus crisis , Veran was joined by Interior Minister Christophe Castaner to propose a new legislation on Tuesday that will see the health emergency move forward through to July 24 . 
Véran said that lifting the emergency earlier would " waste " the " considerable efforts made by the French people . " 
Other proposed measures include limiting travel and introducing a quarantining process for people entering France from " abroad , Corsica and other overseas territory . " 
" The government ’s objective is not to prevent the French people from traveling –– the government ’s objective is to prevent the virus from traveling , " Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said . 
Castaner added there would be no border restrictions between French districts in the proposed measures .
