French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner explained the government strategy in implementing confinement measures in a televised interview on TF1 on Wednesday . 
Castaner said that " our goal is not to sanction , not to fine ; our goal is to protect the French people , and the best way to do that is for them to accept confinement measures . " 
To ensure this , he said : Since Tuesday , police officers have had about 70,000 conversations with the population to explain the measures . 
As of Wednesday , 4,095 fines were imposed . 
Following the restrictive measures announced by French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday , French people must now carry a paper document stating the reason and destination of their travels . 
This document will not be available on mobile phones because " this is not about making life easier for French people who want to go outside , " the interior minister said .
