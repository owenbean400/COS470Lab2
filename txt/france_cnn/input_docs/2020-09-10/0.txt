France should avoid going back into lockdown as it fights the resurgence of Covid 19 in the country , but the government cannot rule out imposing such restrictions at a local level , scientific adviser Jean Fran√ßois Delfraissy said during an interview with RTL today . 
However , he also said that local lockdowns could " not completely be ruled out , " and stronger restrictions could be imposed in regions showing higher infection rates . 
Rising cases : The virus has " started to significantly circulate again " in the past few weeks , leading to " worrying " situations in some regions , Delfraissy explained . 
He added that the " difficult " choices to be made by the government would not only be determined by sanitary reasons , but also by economic and social factors . 
Decisions had to be made quickly to curb the epidemic , he said , as any decision would take " about three weeks " to have visible impacts .
