The number of coronavirus patients in hospitals across France has increased by seven over 24 hours , to 17,185 -- the first rise since April 15 , according to the French Health Agency . 
An agency spokesperson told CNN on Sunday that the additional hospitalizations " could be explained by a delay in record keeping due to the public holiday weekend , " which began on Thursday . 
According to the spokesperson , the holiday weekend " could also have led to the prolongation of some hospitalization cases " across the country . 
Meanwhile , agency data shows the number of patients in ICU continues to decrease , with a total of 1,655 now in intensive care in the country â€“ down by 10 since Saturday .
