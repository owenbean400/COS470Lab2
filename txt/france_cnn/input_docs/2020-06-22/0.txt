Most non university pupils across France returned to school Monday , just a few weeks before schools break up for the summer holidays . 
It has been six weeks since the countrywide lockdown ended in France , which will now implement the start of mandatory school openings and standard attendance rules . 
" In France and overseas , nursery schools , elementary and middle schools will prepare to welcome all pupils from 22 June , on a compulsory basis and according to the rules of normal attendance , " President Emmanuel Macron announced in a national TV address just over a week ago . 
In the classrooms , the health protocols to protect against the spread of Covid 19 are moving " in direction of a reduction , " Minister of Education Jean Michel Blanquer said in an interview with the Public Senate television channel last Wednesday . 
Social distancing rules relaxed for younger pupils : The youngest students do not have to respect the rule of one meter between students . 
Older students have more responsibility . 
" In middle schools , the distance of one meter must be respected , and if this is not possible , a mask is mandatory , " Blanquer added . 
In primary schools , the summer holidays starting on July 4 are only two weeks away and not all parents may send their children back to schools -- even though the return to school is mandatory . 
French schools had already gradually reopened , like primary schools in some regions which were already reopened as early as May 12 , a day after the first phase of the easing of lockdown measures .
