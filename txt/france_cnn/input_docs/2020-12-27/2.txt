The Czech Republic 's Prime Minister , Andrej Babiš , was the first person in the country to receive the coronavirus vaccine , according to CNN affiliate CNN Prima . 
Babiš was given the injection on Sunday . 
The country 's second dose was administered to war veteran Emilia Řepíková . 
The EU launched its mass vaccination program this weekend , after approving the vaccine on December 21 . 
France , Spain and Italy also began their first round of Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccinations on Sunday . 
Babiš said a total of 355,000 doses would be administered in December and January , according to CNN Prima . 
The Czech leader has come under fire in recent months , after coronavirus cases spiked in the country . 
Babiš refused to impose stricter rules on the population , citing the need to protect the country 's economy . 
But the decision -- which in some instances contradicted expert opinion -- led to the virus spreading widely . 
Eventually strict restrictions were enforced . 
In October Babiš admitted he and his government had made mistakes in handling the outbreak and pleaded with people to follow the rules .
