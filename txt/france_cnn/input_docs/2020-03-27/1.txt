The World Health Organization announced on Friday that the first patients enrolled in its Solidarity trial , which will examine potential treatment options for Covid 19 , will be based in Norway and Spain . 
The first patient enrolled in the trial is at the University of Oslo in Norway . 
" This is a historic trial which will dramatically cut the time needed to generate robust evidence about what drugs work . 
Over 45 countries are contributing to the trial and more have expressed interest , " Tedros said . 
" The more countries who join the trial , the faster we will have results . " 
WHO announced last week that it had organized the trial to test coronavirus treatment approaches across several countries and compare data to find which treatments may be most effective . 
When the announcement was made , WHO noted that many countries agreed to join the trial , including Argentina , Bahrain , Canada , France , Iran , Norway , South Africa , Spain , Switzerland and Thailand .
