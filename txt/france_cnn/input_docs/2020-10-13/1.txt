France 's Covid positivity rate -- the percentage of tests that come back positive -- is continuing to rise and has now reached 12.8 % , the country 's health authority said on Monday evening . 
The rate , a key indicator of how fast the virus is spreading , now stands at more than double what it was a month ago -- 5.4 % on September 12 . 
As of Monday night , 1,539 Covid patients were in intensive care in French hospitals . 
The last time the country had more than 1,500 Covid patients in the ICU was May 27 , when the tally reached 1,501 . 
Paris : The capital is faring worse that the rest of the country , with an incidence rate of 413.2 cases per 100,000 in the city versus a national average of 166 , according to the Paris region health authority . 
More than 40 % of ICU beds in the Paris region are occupied by Covid patients , well above the 30 % threshold used to decide when areas or cities should be placed in the " maximum alert " category . 
The Defense Council – a meeting of key ministers chaired by President Emmanuel Macron – is due to meet later Tuesday to discuss the next measures to be taken to slow the spread of the virus .
