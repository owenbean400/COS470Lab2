The city of Paris said Monday it is working on ramping up free Covid 19 testing for Parisians . 
Paris will establish three permanent laboratories and two mobile laboratories which will travel all over the French capital , the city of Paris said in a press release , adding that the tests would be free of charge . 
On Friday , French health authorities warned that the coronavirus epidemic was " growing exponentially . " 
They reported an increase of 7,379 new daily cases , the biggest since late March . 
The daily increase in cases has tripled in under a week , according to French health authorities . 
The recent spike in new infections in France has left the organizers of the Tour de France with a real logistical challenge in how best to stage the 23 day event . 
The world 's toughest bike race began on Saturday ; it will be watched by millions around the world and is due to finish on Paris ' iconic Champs Elys√©es . 
Adding to organizers ' worries , the Alpes Maritimes region -- the site of the opening stages of the race -- has been declared a red zone because of a recent rise in Covid 19 cases . 
To ensure the race can be completed , teams will be expelled from the 2020 event if two riders or members of staff show strong symptoms or test positive for Covid 19 .
