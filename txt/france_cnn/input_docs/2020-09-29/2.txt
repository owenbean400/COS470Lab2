Coronavirus rates are surging in Paris and the surrounding region , according to the French regional health authority . 
France is trying to control a second wave of Covid 19 , with cases rising nationally .

The city of Paris has already met the threshold for the first test , which is if the incidence rate reaches 250 cases per 100,000 people . 
The second criteria is whether 30 % of ICU capacity is occupied by Covid 19 patients . 
The health authority said 344 beds were currently occupied by coronavirus patients in the region . 
This accounts for 30.7 % of total ICU beds . 
The third criteria is the incidence rate of the virus among the elderly . 
The regional health authority says that number is now at 94.5 per 100,000 inhabitants , with 100 per 100,000 being the trigger level . 
While the Paris region remains in dangerous territory , France 's Marseille region is already on maximum alert -- meaning bars and restaurants have had to close .
