One of the Giro d ’Italia ’s pre race favorites , Britain ’s Simon Yates , has withdrawn from the famous cycle race after testing positive for coronavirus . 
The 28 year old , who rides for the Mitchelton Scott team , began to show mild symptoms after Friday ’s seventh stage and was subsequently tested . 
Yates , who won the Vuelta a Espana ( Tour of Spain ) in 2018 , was taken by ambulance to begin a period of quarantine . 
The three week Giro was moved from its traditional slot in May due to the pandemic and it follows the delayed Tour de France in a reshuffled cycling calendar . 
Yates is the first rider to test positive in the Giro which is due to finish in Milan on October 25 . 
The news comes hard on the heels of the cancellation of the Paris Roubaix one day classic next month due to coronavirus spikes in northern France .
