French health minister Olivier Veran said on Tuesday there is a " credible risk " the novel coronavirus outbreak could turn into a pandemic . 
" We have a very strong health system , " Veran added . 
The minister said he had recently met with the daughter of the 80 year old Chinese tourist who died from coronavirus last Saturday in France -- the first fatality from the outbreak in Europe . 
" Out of the 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France , four patients remain in hospital , " Veran said . 
There are two French citizens who tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan . 
They have not asked to be repatriated , according to Veran . 
Not a pandemic : Michael Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization â€™s Health Emergencies Program , said the organization is still not classifying the coronavirus outbreak as a " pandemic " because they were not seeing an " efficient community transmission outside of China . "
