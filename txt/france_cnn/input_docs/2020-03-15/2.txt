French Prime Minister Ã‰douard Philippe announced on Saturday that France will increase social distancing to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic . 
In a televised press conference , Philippe said that starting at midnight Saturday all places that are not essential to French living including restaurants , cafes , cinemas and clubs will be closed . 
The closures include France 's ski resorts , which are shutting down on Sunday . 
The closure order includes all businesses except those that are essential . 
" Markets and food shops , pharmacies , gas stations , banks , newspaper and tobacco stores will remain open , " he said . 
" Places of worships will remain open , but religious ceremonies and gatherings will be postponed . " 
Philippe acknowledged that the French people find the concept of social distancing repugnant : " Because we are a people that likes to gather , a joyful people , a people that likes to live together ... 
Maybe even more when fear starts to spread . " 
" We have seen too many people in cafes and restaurants . 
In usual times , this would make me happy . 
Because this is the France we all love . 
But for a few weeks , this is not what we should be doing , " he said .
