UK Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick hopes that a vehicle pile up at the country 's border with France can be resolved soon , he told Sky News on Wednesday . 
France and the United Kingdom have agreed to reopen their border -- closed due to fears of a new variant of the coronavirus detected in the UK -- but with strict stipulations including that those crossing must have tested negative for Covid 19 in the previous 72 hours . 
Jenrick added he hoped that " this morning , you 'll see people and HGVs ( heavy goods vehicles ) crossing the Channel . " 
NHS Test and Trace staff and the military will be deployed for a mass testing program across parts of Kent where thousands of heavy goods vehicles are currently stuck , PA Media reported earlier . 
" We 're putting in place the infrastructure . 
So the armed forces will be doing that in the first instance to help us to set that up and to get through some of the ( testing ) backlog that you 've seen , they will then in turn hand over to civilians who will take this forward , " Jenrick said . 
As of 7 p.m . Tuesday evening , there were almost 3,000 heavy goods vehicles parked at Manston Airport in Kent , and up to 800 more in other areas across the county , Jenrick added .
