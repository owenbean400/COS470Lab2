German airline Lufthansa is sending a Boeing B777 freighter to the UK with 80 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables on board . 
The flight will land at Doncaster airport this afternoon . 
It comes after big delays at UK ports following the closure of borders due to fears of a new Covid variant . 
France and the UK have now reached an agreement to reopen ports but no trucks or truck drivers had crossed into France from the main port of Dover early Wednesday morning . 
UK supermarkets had warned that supplies of fresh food could be hit if the issues were not resolved soon . 
Lufthansa said it is looking at whether it can send additional cargo flights in the coming days . 
It may even send a passenger aircraft to carry cargo .
