France and the United Kingdom have agreed to reopen their border -- closed due to fears of a new variant of the coronavirus detected in the UK -- but with strict stipulations including that those crossing must have tested negative for Covid 19 in the previous 72 hours . 
Admittance to France will only be granted to those traveling " for urgent reasons , " and will include freight truck drivers , French citizens and British citizens with French residency , according to a UK Department for Transport statement . 
In Dover , a coastal town in England â€™s southeastern county of Kent , row after row of freight trucks could be seen standing idle Tuesday after moving from the port to an unused airfield to await more guidance from UK officials on what to do next . 
NHS Test and Trace staff and the military will be deployed for a mass testing program across parts of Kent where the almost 3,000 heavy goods vehicles are currently stuck , PA Media reported . 
The French government will also conduct sample testing on incoming freight to the UK , the statement from the UK Department for Transport added .
