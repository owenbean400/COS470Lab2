Coronavirus testing is beginning for truckers stranded at the United Kingdom 's border with France , along the English Channel , after French authorities initially blocked and then reopened travel from the UK over fears of a new coronavirus variant . 
Thousands of trucks and other vehicles are currently stranded at the border , unable to cross the Channel into France . 
Under an agreement between the two governments , drivers will be tested and those found to be negative for coronavirus will be able to cross . 
According to a press officer for the Kent Resilience Forum , testing has begun as of Wednesday morning . 
The Kent Resilience Forum is a partnership of organizations working together to support emergency planning in the county with the local government . 
The tests will be done at the M20 Brock contraflow system and then be widened out to Manston Airport , where trucks are also parked , the press officer said . 
Some confusion remains on how many trucks are actually affected : While the Kent Resilience Forum estimates there are more than 4,800 trucks in Kent , the UK Road Haulage Association ( RHA ) believes the overall number is 8,000-10,000 trucks stranded in and around the UK county , Paul Mummery from the RHA told CNN .
