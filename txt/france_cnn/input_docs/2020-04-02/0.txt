There are now 4 million French employees on partial unemployment support and the number is still " strongly increasing , " France ’s Labor Minister Muriel Pénicaud said Thursday . 
Under the scheme , firms can reduce their activity while asking the state for compensation to be redistributed to employees . 
Employees on the minimum wage or in a part time job will receive 100 % of their usual salary , the minister said . 
Other employees will receive 84 % of their salary , Pénicaud added . 
The partial unemployment system should enable the country to recover as quickly as possible after the crisis , as it maintains the link between employers and employees , French PM Edouard Philippe explained on Wednesday .
