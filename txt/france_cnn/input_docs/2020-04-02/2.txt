The Philippine Ambassador to Lebanon , Bernardita Catalla , has died from complications of Covid 19 , the embassy said in a statement on Thursday . 
Catalla , a career diplomat for 27 years , died in hospital in Beirut . 
Months before her death , she spearheaded the evacuation of nearly 2,000 Filipinos , mostly female domestic workers , from crisis ridden Lebanon . 
Lebanon has been in the throes of a financial and political crisis since October 2019 , and many African and Asian migrant workers in the country reported a large drop in earnings and the withholding of salaries . 
The Philippine embassy ’s evacuation program for Filipinos , many of whom were undocumented , received praise from humanitarian workers and international rights groups . 
CNN interviewed Catalla twice about her repatriation program since December . 
" Those who feel that they have to go back to the Philippines do so because they have nothing here anymore . 
Some have become homeless , " Catalla told CNN in February . 
Women clamored for selfies with the ambassador as they waited for the bus to take them to the airport . 
Asked what she thought about the praise being heaped on the embassy for their evacuation program , Catalla responded : " We ’re just doing our jobs . " 
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodro Locsin Jr tweeted that before Catalla died he " extended her a great job in a difficult post . 
I promised her Paris so she ’d hang on . " 
" But she just laughed , ‘ Now I must learn French , ’ " wrote Locsin . 
" Ambassador Bernie Catalla ’s remains will be received with an honor guard and I am putting forward a nomination for Gawad Mabini and Sikatuna , " said Locsin , referring to an honor conferred on Filipinos for distinguished foreign service . 
" Not that she needs more honor than the profound regret and mourning of a grateful service , government , and I hope nation . "
