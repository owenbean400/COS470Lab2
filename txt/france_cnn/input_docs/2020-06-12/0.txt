Beginning June 15 , people coming from European Union member states , as well as from Andorra , Iceland , Liechtenstein , Monaco , Norway , San Marino , Switzerland and the Vatican , will be able to enter French territory without restrictions , according to the statement . 
France will maintain reciprocal restrictions with Spain until June 21 , including a 14 day quarantine for all passengers arriving by air . 
Travelers arriving to France from the UK will no longer be subjected to entry restrictions from June 15 but will be required to observe a 14 day quarantine upon arrival . 
France will also move towards gradually reopening its Schengen zone external borders from July 1 , according to the statement . 
" This opening will be carried out in a progressive and differentiated manner depending on the health situation of the different third countries , and in accordance with the procedures that will be adopted at European level by then , " the statement said . 
France will also give priority to visa and residence permit requests for international students . 
" Given the challenges of university attractiveness , international students will be allowed , whatever their country of origin , to come to France and the conditions of their arrival will be facilitated , " the statement added .
