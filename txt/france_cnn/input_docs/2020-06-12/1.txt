British Airways , Easyjet and Ryanair have launched legal action against the UK government ’s coronavirus quarantine rules . 
The three airlines say the restrictions " will have a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs . " 
On Monday , the UK introduced new rules that required anyone coming into the country to go into a 14 day self isolation , or face fines . 
In a statement the airlines said their legal challenge was based on several factors including " the fact this quarantine , by criminal law , ​ is more stringent than the guidelines applied to people who actually have COVID 19 . " 
They say that , " there was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for such a severe policy . " 
In their challenge , the airlines cite a stipulation that says , " if you are a French or German worker commuting weekly to the UK you will be exempted , and the UK government is banning people traveling to and from countries with lower infection rates than the UK . " 
They also said they have seen no evidence on how and when proposed " air bridges " between the UK and other countries will be implemented .
