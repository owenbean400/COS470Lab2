Airlines UK , the trade body representing carriers including British Airways , easy Jet and Ryanair , has said Britain 's decision to add France , Malta and the Netherlands to its quarantine list is yet " another devastating blow " for the industry . 
The UK announced on Thursday evening that people arriving from France , Malta and the Netherlands , as well as Aruba and the Turks and Caicos Islands were required to quarantine for 14 days from arrival from 4 a.m . local time Saturday ( 11 p.m . ET Friday ) . 
Since easing lockdown restrictions , the UK has maintained a travel corridor with listed countries from which people can travel without having to quarantine , but the list has changed repeatedly as cases spike and fade globally . 
Thursday 's announcement followed rising coronavirus cases in countries across Europe . 
Airlines UK urged the British government to consider a regional approach to quarantines as opposed to a national one , which affects people travelling from any part of an affected country , regardless of regional case rates . 
The trade body said the UK 's " broad brush , weekly ‘ stop and go ’ changes to travel corridors at a national level " were disruptive to airlines and passengers alike . 
Airlines UK has also pushed for a testing regime to be implemented for arriving passengers , so that those testing negative can avoid having to self isolate . 
The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) has also called for co ordinated measures – it has warned already that 780,000 jobs are at risk in the UK due to the aviation shutdown . 
France has said it will impose reciprocal quarantine measures on visitors from the UK .
