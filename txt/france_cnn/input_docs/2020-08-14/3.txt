The French capital Paris and the southern city of Marseille and its surrounding areas have been classified as " zones of active circulation " of coronavirus , according to a French government decree published today . 
The classification allows local authorities to impose further restrictions , including limits on movement and the closure of restaurants , bars or other venues , according to a previous decree which set out conditions to the lifting of lockdown measures . 
French Health Minister Olivier Veran announced on Wednesday that Paris and Marseille would " probably " soon be reclassified as zones of active circulation of the virus " given the evolution of the epidemic . " 
The cities are " particularly at risk " because they are highly populated , with young people who have " an intense social activity , " Director of National Health Agency Jérôme Salomon told France Inter radio this morning .
