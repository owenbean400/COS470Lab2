India is creating an air corridor with Maldives in a bid to boost tourism and revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic , the Indian Ministry of External Affairs announced Thursday . 
The corridor would " facilitate movement of people from both sides for employment , tourism , medical emergencies , " the ministry said in a press release . 
The first flight under the new arrangement is expected to take off on August 18 . 
" The air bubble symbolizes India â€™s support to shore up tourism arrivals and revenues in the Maldives , " the ministry said . 
The Indian government has also extended urgent financial assistance of $ 250 million in the form of a soft loan to assist Maldives in its economic recovery during the pandemic . 
In March , India banned all international flights in and out of the country as part of its coronavirus response . 
It has since opened up air corridors with France , the United Arab Emirates , the United States and Germany to facilitate travel . 
The announcement of the Maldives travel bubble comes as India reported 64,553 new coronavirus cases and 1,007 deaths on Friday .
