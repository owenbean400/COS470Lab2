French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe says France wo not return to normal for a long time . 
Philippe said that France had passed the peak of the epidemic . 
But the country is not going to return to normal soon because right now there is no vaccine and no treatment , he warned . 
France has suspended all non essential business until May 11 . 
Philippe said May 11 wo not be the end of the confinement , but a new phase . 
He said that measures for after May 11 will be announced in a couple of weeks and will be based on three main principles : social distancing , massive testing and isolation of people who have tested positive . 
The prime minister indicated that schools wo not be reopening everywhere after May 11 and , in any case , would be operating differently . 
Authorities were considering options such as telling students to attend class on alternate weeks , or using bigger classrooms than usual . 
The prime minister also announced that visits to nursing homes would be reauthorized as of Monday , but would be severely restricted . 
For example , physical contact would not be allowed , he said .
