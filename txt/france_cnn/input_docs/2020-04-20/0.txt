As he shut down his factory in January amid China 's growing coronavirus epidemic , Vance Wang had a revelation . 
Usually , his assembly line in Foshan , a city in the southern province of Guangdong , produces plastic sheets for whiteboards . 
However , Wang realized that a change in process meant he could switch to creating face shields to protect himself and his workers from coronavirus in the long weeks and months ahead . 
" I wanted to create a good quality product , in a bigger size to cover all of the face , " he told CNN over video chat . 
Wang said he had not intended to make equipment for hospitals , but as the coronavirus crisis worsened , hospitals around the world came asking for help . 
" We started making them in early March , " he said . 
The initial order was only in the thousands . 
After a week , it increased to tens of thousands . 
" Now we have received orders for more and more , " he said . 
Wang has not just been selling the face shields -- he 's donated about 8,000 to hospitals in Europe and the US . 
According to Wang , 3,000 have gone to Germany , 2,000 to France and 1,000 the United States , with another 2,000 or so expected to be delivered to New York soon .
