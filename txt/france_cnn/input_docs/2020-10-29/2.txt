A second national coronavirus lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus is not " inevitable , " the UK 's housing minister Robert Jenrick told the BBC on Thursday . 
When asked whether the UK will be going towards a national lockdown as France and Germany announced on Wednesday , Jenrick said , " I do not think anything is inevitable , " adding that " if we all take action in our own daily lives that will help to tilt the balance in favor of our current approach , which is taking action in places where the virus is most concentrated and avoiding some of the actions you see happening in continental Europe . " 
The minister defended the UK government 's " regionalized approach " to try and contain the spread of COVID 19 in the country , saying that a national lockdown " should be reviewed as a last resort . " 
" The judgement that we 're making today is that if we follow the regionalized approach , we 've got a good prospect of getting this under control , " Jenrick said . 
" Because the alternative , we know , is very destructive and damaging to people 's livelihoods . " 
" If we go for a full national lockdown , it may not be for a short period of time as someone has suggested , " he added . 
The UK government introduced a three tier system of restrictions this month , with the worst affected areas facing the tightest measures to control the spread of the virus .
