Nursing home staff in France will receive bonuses of up to 1,500 euros , roughly $ 1,634 USD , Health Minister Olivier Véran said today . 
The bonus will " reward their unwavering commitment " during the county 's coronavirus health crisis , Véran said . 
Last month , the Prime Minister announced a bonus for frontline health care workers , prompting nursing home staff to demand similar recognition .
