Germany 's Bundesliga is set to become the first major football league to resume play during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Matches will restart from on May 16 , the CEO of the German Football League ( DFL ) Christian Seifert announced today . 
He said Borussia Dortmund versus Schalke 04 are among the first to kick off . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel set out plans yesterday for the gradual reopening of the country after weeks long restrictions , including resuming play for the country 's top football league . 
She did not specify if this would be with spectators or behind closed doors . 
It would be the first major European league to resume playing . 
Last week , France canceled its season and declared Paris Saint Germain the winner of Ligue 1 . 
Merkel said authorities would watch local regions to ensure any outbreak was stopped . 
Germany is widely considered to have responded effectively to the pandemic , thanks in part to its large scale coronavirus testing capacity .
