German Chancellor Angela Merkel set out plans Wednesday for the gradual reopening of the country after weeks long restrictions imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus . 
Limits on social contact will remain in place until June 5 , she said , but Germans can now meet with members of one other household as well as their own . 
People must still remain 1.5 meters apart and cover their mouths and noses in public . 
Shops can reopen but with additional hygiene measures , Merkel said , speaking at a news conference following a video meeting with the prime ministers of Germany 's 16 states . 
Germany 's top football league , the Bundesliga , can also resume play in the second half of May , Merkel said . 
She did not specify if this would be with spectators or behind closed doors . 
It would be the first major European league to resume playing .

Merkel said authorities would watch local regions to ensure any outbreak was stopped .
