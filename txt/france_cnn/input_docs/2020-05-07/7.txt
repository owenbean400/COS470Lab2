French students will gradually start returning to schools staring Monday , depending on where they live and their school year , French Education Minister Jean Michel Blanquer said today . 
Primary schools will open across the country Monday , with classes limited to 15 students , Blanquer said . 
Middle school students from regions where the rate of infection is slowing down — categorized as " green " by the French government — will be returning to school on May 18 . 
But middle schools in areas where the virus is still actively circulating — categorized as " red " — will not reopen . 
High schools will remain closed until at least the beginning of June , the education minister added . 
Schools " cannot welcome everyone at the same time , " Blanquer said , so some students will be given priority . 
These include disabled children , children of health care or essential workers , and children who are classed as at risk of dropping out . 
In some instances children may return next Tuesday to give professors time to prepare .
