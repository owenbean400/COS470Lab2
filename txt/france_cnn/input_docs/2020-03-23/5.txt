American vodka company Tito 's Vodka says it plans to use its distillery for something a little different : Hand sanitizer . 
" While we advise that you cannot use our standard vodka product as a hand santizier , our team at the distillery has been working hard to get all of the pieces in place to begin production on a hand sanitizer that adheres to industry and governmental guidance , " the company said in a statement . 
" While we do not have all of the details quite yet , we do know we will be giving it away for free to our community and those most in need . " 
They 're not the first company to switch gear . 
Earlier this month , luxury goods conglomerate LVMH , the parent company of Christian Dior , Guerlain and Givenchy , said it would help French health authorities by manufacturing hand sanitizer and providing it to them for free . 
LVMH said it would use all the production facilities of its perfumes and cosmetics brands to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gel , or hand sanitizer .
