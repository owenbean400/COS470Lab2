Industries across France are at " about 25 % capacity , " with some industrial sectors dropping in capacity by some 80 % , French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday . 
Le Maire called on the European Union to " do much more " to support France through this period of economic downturn , warning that there is " no comparison in recent history " to a situation like the Covid 19 outbreak . 
" All sectors are affected , some more violently than others because their activity has totally stopped . 
I 'm thinking of tourism , the aviation industry , restaurants , hotels , cinemas , the leisure industry , the events industry ... all of these sectors have a drop in business of 90 to 100 % , " Le Maire said .
