Aisne , a region in northern France , has banned the sale of alcohol while emergency measures due to coronavirus are in place . 
The ban has been put in place over an increasing risk of domestic violence due to restriction of movement , local police said on Tuesday . 
" As intra family violence is often associated with excessive alcohol consumption , a regulation measure to take away sales of alcoholic beverages until March 31st had been decided , " police said a statement . 
This announcement came after Minister of Interior Christophe Castaner stressed police effort to crack down on domestic violence cases .
