Thousands of British holidaymakers have been trying to return home from France in an attempt to avoid new quarantine restrictions imposed by the UK government . 
The rush came after the government announced late on Thursday that all people arriving in the UK from France , where Covid 19 infections rates are high , would need to self isolate for 14 days from Saturday onwards . 
The rule change , which came into force at 4 a.m . BST Saturday , also applies to those traveling to the UK from the Netherlands , Monaco , Malta , Turks and Caicos Islands and Aruba . 
Transport operators noted a steep surge in demand as people booked last minute tickets in a race to beat the Saturday morning deadline . 
The Eurotunnel Le Shuttle train service , which transports vehicles between France and the UK , was fully booked on Friday as a result of the increased demand , according to PA Media . 
A spokesperson for the service told the news agency that 12,000 people attempted to buy tickets in the hour after the government 's announcement on Thursday , compared to the hundreds of requests it usually receives over the same time period . 
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government 's decision to end the travel corridors with France and the other destinations was based on the latest available coronavirus data . 
" Data shows we need to remove France , the Netherlands , Monaco , Malta , Turks & Caicos & Aruba from our list of coronavirus Travel Corridors to keep infection rates down , " he tweeted on Thursday .
