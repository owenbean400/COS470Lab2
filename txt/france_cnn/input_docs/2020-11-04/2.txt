UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the country 's lawmakers Wednesday that he has been " confronted " with data which projects that the National Health Service ( NHS ) could " collapse " without further measures . 
Johnson urged the British parliament to vote on Wednesday to approve new time limited coronavirus restrictions that would see England enter a new national lockdown from midnight on Thursday . 
In a statement to the House of Commons , the British leader said deaths in this second wave could potentially exceed those of the first . 
The UK was badly hit by the pandemic in the spring wave and has reported more than 47,000 deaths . 
He added : " I am sorry to say that the number of Covid patients in some hospitals is already higher than at the peak of the first wave . " 
Johnson told lawmakers Wednesday that if the virus ' reproductive rate was not reduced to below one , England faces " a bleak and an uncertain future of steadily rising infections and admissions until as I say the capacity of the NHS is breached . " 
The new period of restriction is expected to last until December 2 . 
Johnson 's decision follows similar measures imposed in France and Germany . 
The British PM said he hoped the country could return to a tiered system on a local and a regional basis after the lockdown period .
