Only a few weeks ago , the cafés , bars and restaurants of Paris were bustling late into the night , neon signs gleaming and masked patrons spilling onto flower filled terraces , still reveling in their freedom after a strict spring lockdown . 
The street life the city is famous for was back , and it was almost as if the French capital was back to its old self Now , those same streets are being deserted again , as a strict new nightly curfew is imposed to combat a worrying surge in coronavirus cases in France that are part of a wider trend of numbers rising across Europe . 
Hospitality venues must close and citizens stay home between between 9 p.m . to 6 a.m . across Paris . 
Other French cities , including Aix en Provence , Grenoble , Marseille , Montpellier , Toulouse , Saint Etienne , Lille , Rouen and Lyon are also affected . 
Violating the rules carries a fine of € 135 ( roughly $ 160 ) for a first offense , and goes up to € 1,500 ( $ 1,760 ) if the offense is repeated . 
Photographer Kiran Ridley took to the boulevards and alleyways of Paris on October 17 -- the night the curfew was introduced -- to capture what it 's like when the city goes dark , and contrast these eerie images with snapshots of livelier scenes of the same spots back in September and early October .
