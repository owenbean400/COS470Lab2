The mayor of Rouen , one of the cities in France now under a nighttime curfew , says the health sector is exhausted and needs more help . 
Nicolas Mayer Rossignol told CNN that he knows the city must apply by the curfew rules , but he foresees economic damage . 
Asked if the central government is giving enough financial support to the French cities now under curfew , Mayer Rossignol said , " You need the two legs : you can have restrictions but if you have strong restrictions you must have strong incentives and strong help . " 
About 20 million people – roughly a third of France 's population – in the capital Paris and regions of Aix en Provence , Marseille , Grenoble , Montpellier , Toulouse , Saint Etienne , Lille , Lyon and Rouen are affected by the 9 p.m . to 6 a.m . curfew expected to last a month . 
He said that although they do have financial help " there are some specific sectors where help is desperately needed , especially the health sector " . 
" The big difference with the confinement a few months ago is that when it started in March - April the whole health sector was fully mobilized and strongly committed to do everything they could to battle – and currently they are just exhausted . 
So we need more help , " Mayer Rossignol added .
