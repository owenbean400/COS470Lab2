French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Tuesday backed off its CEO ’s apparent suggestion that the United States would have priority for a coronavirus vaccine if the company develops one , French President Emmanuel Macron ’s office said . 
Sanofi executives " confirm to the President that the group share France 's approach to universal access to the vaccine with the aim of making it a global public good , " the Elysee Palace said in a statement . 
Macron summoned the company ’s chairman of the board , CEO and president to a meeting Tuesday after CEO Paul Hudson said last week that the " US government has the right to the largest pre order because it 's invested in taking the risk . " 
Hudson was speaking to Bloomberg News . 
French officials responded angrily to the comments from Hudson , with deputy finance minister Agnès Pannier Runacher saying : " It would be unacceptable for Sanofi to reserve its Covid 19 vaccine as a priority , if it were to find one , to one country or another for financial reason . " 
Jean Baptiste Froville , a spokesman for Sanofi , said in a statement on Friday that Hudson 's comments had been misinterpreted . 
Sanofi Chairman of the Board Serge Weinberg , President Olivier Bogillot , and CEO Hudson met with Macron for 45 mins Tuesday , Macron ’s office said . 
The Elysee statement added that Sanofi " is fully committed to its presence in France . " 
There was no immediate statement from Sanofi following the meeting .
