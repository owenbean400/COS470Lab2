In 1911 , a deadly epidemic spread through China and threatened to become a pandemic . 
Its origins appeared to be related to the trade in wild animals , but at the time no one was sure . 
Lockdowns , quarantine measures , the wearing of masks , travel restrictions , the mass cremation of victims , and border controls were deployed to try to lower the infection rate . 
Yet more than 60,000 people died in modern day northeast China , making it one of the world 's largest epidemics at the time . 
When the disease was eventually brought under control , the Chinese government convened the International Plague Conference in the northern city of Shenyang -- close to the epicenter of the outbreak . 
In attendance were virologists , bacteriologists , epidemiologists and disease experts from many of the world 's major powers -- the United States , Japan , Russia , the United Kingdom and France . 
The purpose of the conference : Experts wanted to find the cause of the outbreak , learn which suppression techniques were most effective , discover why the disease had spread so far so fast , and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave . 
Learning the lessons : As the world faces a pandemic characterized by a lack of a globally co ordinated response and multilateral effort on the part of political leaders , the collaborative aspects of the 1911 conference in China are worth reconsidering .
