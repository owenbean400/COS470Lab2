Amazon France has said it is extending the closure of its distribution centers in the country through May 18 . 
The online retail company closed the centers on April 15 , after a French court ordered Amazon France to stop all non essential deliveries during the pandemic . 
The ruling was upheld by the Versailles court of appeal on April 24 . 
The court ordered the corporation to limit its sales to technology , DIY , pet related items , medical , hygiene , and grocery products until it resolved issues with workers ’ groups about measures the company put in place to protect workers against coronavirus . 
The court added that a fine of 100,000 euros would apply to each item sold from a non approved category . 
Amazon had earlier blamed the ruling on labor unions , which brought the complaint accusing the online delivery giant of endangering the lives of workers by not instituting enough safety precautions to protect against the virus . 
Amazon said on Wednesday that it was continuing to talk with workers ’ representatives and had received their request to include an independent expert in the negotiations .
