Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert , the first NBA player to test positive for Covid 19 , told the French sports publication L ’Equipe that he still has not recovered from the virus . 
When speaking with the French sports publication , Gobert revealed that his senses have not fully recovered saying , " The taste has returned , but the smell is still not 100 % . 
I can smell the smells , but not from afar . 
I spoke to specialists , who told me that it could take up to a year . " 
Some context : The 28 year old faced backlash after he touched every microphone during a press conference while discussing the pandemic , just days before testing positive . 
NBA commissioner Adam Silver made the decision to suspend the season on March 11 after the Frenchman ’s positive diagnosis . 
Gobert plans to join the Jazz in Orlando when the NBA season returns on July 30 .
