The French government will provide 15 million euros ( $ 16.5 million ) in vouchers for homeless people to help them survive during the country 's coronavirus epidemic . 
French Minister of Housing Julien Denormandie announced the voucher scheme Wednesday in an interview with French newspaper Ouest France . 
" It is a bit like a meal voucher , " he said , " that we will distribute to homeless people who have difficulty accessing basic necessities . " 
" We believe half of the 60,000 beneficiaries of these new service vouchers are in the greater Paris region . " 
Denormandie said the government was working closely with civil organizations and community leaders on working out which areas have the greatest need . 
The new program aims to help 60,000 homeless people left without resources during the lockdown . 
The vouchers would provide financial assistance of US$7.68 per day per person to get access to basic necessities like food and hygiene products . 
Since the beginning of the lockdown , France has also made 5,500 hotel rooms available as temporary homeless shelter , according to government numbers .
