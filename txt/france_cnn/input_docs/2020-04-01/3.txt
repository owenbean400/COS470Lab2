Fifteen days into the confinement period , the French police and gendarmerie -- the military police -- have done 5.8 million checks to see if people have a valid reason for being out and about , French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on French TV LCI Wednesday morning . 
This comes a day after a 22 year old was sentenced to 105 hours of community service in Paris by police for repeated failure to respect the confinement measures , says the Paris Prosecutor 's Office . 
The man was released from prison last September . 
He was fined four times on March 24 alone , and again two days later , and each time found with invalid papers during police checks . 
French officials say people can only walk and exercise around a one kilometer radius from their home , for a maximum of one hour . 
They are also expected to handwrite a government mandated permission slip .
