A 9 year old boy has died from a rare condition possibly linked to coronavirus , a spokesperson for the Timone Marseille hospital in the south of France told CNN on Friday . 
The child had tested positive for coronavirus , but he did not develop symptoms , the spokesperson added . 
He was hospitalized for seven days after suffering cardiac arrest and subsequently died of a " neurological injury " as a result of the cardiac arrest on Saturday . 
French authorities are " aware of a rare disease resembling Kawasaki disease , with symptoms consisting of inflammation , swollen limbs , skin rashes , and most seriously a heart attack , " the Director of the National Health Agency Jérôme Salomon said last month . 
A spokesperson for the national health agency told CNN today that " 135 children have developed this disease since the beginning of the pandemic . " 
This is the first known fatality in France . 
While this disease resembles Kawasaki disease , the French health agency is calling the disease " Kawasaki like , " according to a national health agency spokeswoman . 
" Kawasaki disease is usually found in children under 5 years old , while the disease we are observing now targets children from 5 to 15 years old , " she said .
