French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has said comments made by its CEO Paul Hudson indicating the US market could be prioritized for a Covid 19 vaccine were " misinterpreted " . 
The company previously said its cooperation with the US â€™s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) would allow it to initiate production as soon as possible . 
Sanofi added that it was exploring similar opportunities within Europe . 
French President Emmanuel Macron summoned Hudson to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss his concerns . 
" The pre order priority granted to the United States government only concerns the phase of production of the vaccine in the United States . 
Our goal is to produce this vaccine as soon as possible at all of our sites . " 
" The production of a vaccine with speed and in large quantity is a capital intensive operation that can only be financed with help of state funds . 
This is what happened in the United States , where we signed an agreement with the BARDA in February , covering funding of several hundred million dollars , " he said . 
Froville said that while there is no equivalent to BARDA outside the US , discussions in Europe -- with the European Union and a number of its members , including France -- were progressing . 
" We 're actually talking about a vaccine that does not exist . 
It usually takes ten years to research , develop and manufacture a vaccine . 
With the Covid 19 , the goal is to be able to do it all in 18-24 months . 
This involves taking a financial risk , consisting of starting production before the end of the development phase , so before we know if the vaccine is even effective . 
This risk must be shared with countries , " he added .
