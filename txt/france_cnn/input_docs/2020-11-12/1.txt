French Prime Minister Jean Castex says one in four deaths currently happening in the country are caused by Covid 19 . 
" Today in France 1 in 4 deaths is due to the virus " Castex said on Thursday . 
" France is facing an extremely strong second epidemic wave , " he added . 
Over the past week between 400 and 500 people have died every day , he said . 
" It would be irresponsible to lift or lighten lockdown now , " Castex continued . 
" We have decided to keep the rules unchanged for at least the next 15 days . " 
" For a week now , we have noted a drop in the number of positive cases , " the Prime Minister said about the numbers . 
" If that trend is confirmed , the peak of the second wave could be reached at the beginning of next week . " 
He added that measures could be eased starting December 1st , emphasizing that those measures would be limited to reopening some shops , and would exclude the reopening of bars and restaurants . 
" If that trend [ of lower numbers ] does not confirm next week , we will take further action . " he added . 
Commenting on the increased pressure on the hospital system , Castex said 4,803 patients were currently in intensive care , which is " 95 % of our usual capacity . "
