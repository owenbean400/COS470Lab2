Amazon says it may suspend all of its distribution activity in France after a court ruled Tuesday it had to stop all non essential activities due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
In a statement on Wednesday , the company said it is " perplexed " by the court ruling . 
The online retail giant went on to say it has already implemented safety measures including " temperature checks , masks , and enforced social distancing which have received the approval of health and safety representatives at multiple sites . " 
Some context : On Tuesday a French court ordered Amazon to reduce its local delivery operations to only essential goods , or the company could face a penalty of 1 million euros ( $ 1.1 million ) for each day of delay . 
The court has also required that the company carry out an assessment of the " occupational risks inherent in the Covid 19 epidemic " in all of its warehouses .
