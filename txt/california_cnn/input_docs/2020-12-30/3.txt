If the US is able to " diligently vaccinate " people in 2021 , the nation could return to normal life by early fall , Dr . Anthony Fauci said in an interview with California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom on Wednesday . 
Although Covid 19 vaccine rollout is off to a slower start than expected , if the US is able to " catch up " in 2021 , widespread vaccination could be possible beginning in April , Fauci said . 
Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said that herd immunity against coronavirus could likely be achieved if about 70 % to 85 % of the population gets vaccinated . 
" By the time we get to the early fall , we will have enough good herd immunity to be able to really get back to some strong semblance of normality â€“ schools , theaters , sports events , restaurants , " he said . 
" I believe if we do it correctly , we will be there by the early fall . " 
Fauci urged people to get vaccinated .
