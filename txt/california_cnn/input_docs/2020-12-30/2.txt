Covid 19 vaccines should be effective against the new UK virus variant , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Wednesday . 
Fauci told California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom that Covid 19 vaccines will likely protect against the new variant , which has now been identified in California and Colorado . 
The variant appears to be more transmissible but not more deadly . 
However , something to keep an eye on is how monoclonal antibodies will work against this new strain . 
" Since these are specific mutations , we want to make sure that they do not evade the protection of certain of the monoclonal antibodies , because the monoclonal antibody is against a very specific component of the virus , " he said . 
" The other thing that they 've noted in the UK , is that people who have been infected do not seem to get reinfected by this , which means that the immunity that 's given to you when you get infected is protective against this particular strain , " he added . 
Fauci said the new strain does not appear to have any impact on diagnostics . 
He noted that the National Institutes of Health , along with other scientists in the US , are working to learn more about the new strain using isolates from the UK .
