A few weeks into the coronavirus quarantine , 16 year old Emmy Apfel was sitting at home in Palo Alto , California , with nothing to do . 
It was her school 's spring break , everything was canceled and the overwhelming boredom left her grasping for something , anything , to occupy her time . 
She posted an ad on the website Nextdoor , offering to help tutor younger students at risk of falling behind as schools shifted to online classes . 
Within 30 minutes , she had received 50 replies . 
" OK , " the sophomore thought . 
" We have to assemble the troops . " 
Apfel organized eight friends into a management team to tutor local students from kindergarten through eighth grade . 
They quickly turned it into a burgeoning nonprofit organization dubbed Beyond the Book . 
One of her friends built the new venture 's website in two days so parents and kids could sign up for Zoom tutoring sessions . 
By mid June , Beyond the Book was offering 200 weekly sessions for children run by more than 100 volunteer high school students , mostly in the United States , but one hailing from as far as Ireland . 
" I was very surprised ( by the response ) , " she said . 
" I just wanted to give back to my community and find something to do . "
