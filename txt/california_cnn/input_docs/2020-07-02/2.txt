A Southern California man who tested positive for coronavirus after attending a party expressed his fear and regret a day before he died . 
Thomas Macias , 51 , went to a barbecue last month near his community in Lake Elsinore , about 70 miles from Los Angeles . 
Shortly after the party , he started feeling sick . 
On June 20 , he posted a poignant message on Facebook to warn his loved ones about the risks of the virus , his family said . 
" I went out a couple of weeks ago ... because of my stupidity I put my mom and sisters and my family 's health in jeopardy , " he wrote . 
" This has been a very painful experience . 
This is no joke . 
If you have to go out , wear a mask , and practice social distancing . ... 
Hopefully with God 's help , I 'll be able to survive this . " 
He never made it . 
He died a day after that post .
