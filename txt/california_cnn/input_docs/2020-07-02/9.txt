Enforcement of health orders is contingent on local authorities , but California ’s governor is again threatening to withhold funding from those who do not comply . 
Part of California ’s new budget included a trailer bill , which allows dissemination of funds based on contingent behavior , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said . 
He is referring to the distribution of $ 2.1 billion , which includes CARES Act and realignment dollars . 
The enforcement directive applies to everyone in the state , not just to businesses . 
Yet companies seem to be the focus of intervention , with Newsom noting that the state sent out 350,00 letters to businesses on Wednesday specifically laying out expectations and good business behaviors to protect employees and customers . 
The governor said he supports the idea of issuing citations if necessary , but stresses that education and encouragement to follow the directives should come first .
