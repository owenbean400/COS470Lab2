Penn and his charity , Community Organized Relief Effort ( CORE ) , have been involved in the Haiti earthquake and US hurricane relief . 
Penn told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper the infrastructure already existed to put them in a place to easily offer assistance . 
" We had the infrastructure and when we came into play , we came into a highly function governmental response in Los Angeles , " Penn said , commending Mayor Eric Garcetti and Gov . 
Gavin Newsom ’s response to the virus . 
Penn said that it ’s a fluid situation as testing continues to evolve in the country , but added the federal government is key to organizing and distributing proper equipment .
