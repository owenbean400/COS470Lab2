The mayor of Santa Monica , California , issued a stark forecast for the city ’s economy as it struggles through the coronavirus pandemic . 
Mc Keown went on to discuss how the city will be " down by $ 224 billion " over the next two years , which is needed to fund " police and fire , to pick up the trash , to have clean , pure water in the pipes . " 
" So that 's going to mean other services now in this city have to be cut . 
And that 's very hard to do , " he said . 
There have been layoffs and voluntary retirement for city staff , Mc Keown said . 
" We 've had recessions before , but never anything that happened this suddenly or this deeply that took that much money out of the city coffers so quickly , " he said . 
The city ’s beaches are open for recreational activities , but parking lots are closed and people cannot sunbathe or go in the water . 
The famous Santa Monica Pier is also closed . 
Santa Monica is now " the home of the three piece bathing suit : a bikini and a face mask , " the mayor said . 
Mc Keown also slammed the federal government for not implementing more relief funding for cities that are suffering economically . 
" It 's been about 10 weeks since I really had a good night 's sleep or had a day off . 
I 'm not saying that for pity . 
It 's just the reality of trying to run a local government in these unprecedented circumstances , " he said .
