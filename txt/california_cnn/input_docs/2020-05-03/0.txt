More than 500 people gathered at the California Capitol in Sacramento Friday to protest Gov . 
Gavin Newsom â€™s stay at home order . 
" The majority of the demonstrators were not wearing face masks or physically distancing and at one point a group of them locked hands , " according to the California Highway Patrol . 
" In so doing , they were jeopardizing the health and safety of themselves , as well as our officers and onlookers during this ongoing Covid 19 pandemic . " 
As a result , police arrested 32 people for failing to comply with the lawful orders to disperse , along with health and safety violations , the release said .
