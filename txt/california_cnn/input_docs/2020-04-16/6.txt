There were 100 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody today who tested positive for coronavirus , ICE told congressional staff . 
The individuals " have been medically isolated and are receiving care , " ICE said in its notice . 
Detainees were being held in facilities in Pennsylvania , California , Louisiana , New York , Texas and Arizona . 
Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli told reporters this week that ICE has released nearly 700 people from custody after conducting medical reviews stemming from concerns about the coronavirus . 
ICE reviewed its cases to identify people who would be eligible for release , including detainees who are 60 years old and over and those who are pregnant . 
The agency later expanded its review to include all people in ICE custody to assess those who have " medical fragility , " Cuccinelli said . 
There are fewer than 34,000 people in detention . 
The decrease is also due in part to a slower pace of intake and ongoing deportations , not just medical releases .
