Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month he had obtained more than 1,000 ventilators to help California hospitals treating patients infected with the coronavirus , an effort Gov . 
Gavin Newsom hailed as " heroic . " 
Now , more than three weeks later , the governor ’s office says none of the promised ventilators have been received by hospitals . 
At a March 23 news conference , Newsom said the devices , which can provide life saving support to patients infected with the virus , had already arrived in Los Angeles and were on their way to hospitals in need . 
" I told you a few days ago that he was likely to have 1,000 ventilators this week , " Newsom said . 
" They 've arrived in Los Angeles , and Elon Musk is already working with hospital association and others to get those ventilators out . 
It ’s a heroic effort . " 
Shortly after the dramatic announcement , Musk said in a tweet : " China had an oversupply , so we bought 1255 FDA approved Res Med , Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA . 
If you want a free ventilator installed , please let us know ! " 
But despite the claims , none of the ventilators promised by Musk have been delivered to hospitals . 
Spokespersons for Tesla did not return CNN requests for comment . 
The news was first reported by the Sacramento Bee . 
Some background : Major US companies like Ford and Apple have also announced plans to produce ventilators and donate face masks for health care workers treating patients infected with the virus . 
Last week , Newsom reassured residents that California now has enough ventilators to meet its projected needs , after some questioned his decision to lend 500 machines to other states in crisis . 
UPDATE : After this post was initially published , Elon Musk responded on Twitter .
