A federal judge denied a blanket motion to release families in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody as a result of the coronavirus pandemic , according to a Wednesday ruling . 
Immigration advocates and lawyers have urged the Trump administration to release families who are in federal immigration custody , given the confined setting and potential spread of coronavirus . 
In a separate lawsuit in California , a federal judge found that ICE â€™s Covid 19 protocols fell short and ordered the release of children . 
That case set up the potential that children could be separated from their families . 
But the case before Judge James Boasberg in Washington , DC , called for the release of families , not just children . 
He did not agree with the plaintiffs ' request to release everyone . 
In a 26 page ruling , Boasberg detailed the precautions taken by the government , like mask use , and addressed issues raised by plaintiffs , like lack of social distancing and medical care . 
Despite recognizing steps taken by ICE and shortfalls alleged by plaintiffs , Boasberg said other options , outside of blanket release , need to be considered . 
Attorneys for the families are reviewing their options .
