The University of Washington now projects there will be 219,864 US deaths from Covid 19 by November 1 , based on the current scenario . 
Last week , the university ’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecast 224,546 total deaths by November . 
The latest update reflects a decrease of about 5,000 deaths in part due to increasing mandates for members of the public to wear masks , and the general increase in the number of people wearing masks and social distancing even without mandates . 
If the US universally adopted wearing masks , that number of deaths by November 1 would drop to 185,887 , the model projects . 
However , if the mandates ease more , then the United States could see 231,012 deaths by that time . 
Ali Mokdad , a professor of health metrics sciences at IHME , said that they ’ve seen more people wearing masks in states that have seen a recent spike in cases such as in Florida , California , Texas and Arizona , but the states that have mask mandates have seen more universal adoption . 
So far , according to Johns Hopkins University , more than 3.91 million Americans have been infected with coronavirus and at least 142,350 have died .
