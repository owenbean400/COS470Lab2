The University of California , Berkeley , will begin fall semester with " fully remote instruction , " the university announced in a statement to its faculty and staff on Tuesday . 
Citing trend lines and the increase in coronavirus cases across California and Alameda County , the university said a " dramatic reversal in the public health situation " is unlikely before the semester begins on August 26 . 
" We continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow , " UC Berkeley said . 
The fully remote option is open for all students , according to the statement . 
UC Berkeley plans to continue with remote education after Thanksgiving , even if some in person instruction becomes available . 
UC Berkeley is the first among 10 campuses across the state to announce its decision to begin the semester entirely online .
