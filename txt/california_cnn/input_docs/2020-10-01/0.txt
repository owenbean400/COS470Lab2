America 's jobs recovery continues , albeit at a slow pace , as another 837,000 Americans filed for first time unemployment benefits last week , on a seasonally adjusted basis . 
That was slightly fewer from the prior week , although last week 's figures notably do not include updated numbers from California , which paused processing initial claims for two weeks . 
The state is working on a large backlog in benefits claims and implementing fraud prevention . 
The Labor Department estimated California 's initial claims numbers by duplicating the prior week 's reported claims figures . 
Claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that Congress created to help workers who would not usually be eligible for benefits , such as the self employed , stood at 650,120 . 
Adding these together , there were 1.4 million total first time claims for benefits last week , roughly even with the prior week . 
Continued claims , which count workers who have filed for benefits for at least two consecutive weeks , stood at 11.8 million on a seasonally adjusted basis . 
The slowing pace of the decline in initial jobless claims is another piece of evidence that the economic recovery is running out of steam . 
Thursday 's Labor Department report on jobless claims is just the latest in this week 's report card on the labor market : the government 's jobs report — the last before the election — is due on Friday . 
Economists expect 850,000 jobs were added back in September , bringing the unemployment rate to 8.2 % , down from 8.4 % in August .
