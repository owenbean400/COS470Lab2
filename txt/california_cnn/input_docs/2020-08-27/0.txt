The US federal government said Wednesday it â€™s investing nearly $ 2.5 million in efforts to create a needle free coronavirus vaccine . 
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) announced four small grants to groups trying to make either oral vaccines against coronavirus , or patches that could painlessly deliver a vaccine . 
The four new technologies are also " shelf stable " -- unlike current coronavirus vaccine candidates , they do not have to be kept under special conditions or temperatures , making them easier to store and deliver . 
The four groups : Michigan based Esperovax is working on vaccines people could take in capsules . 
They received $ 600,000 from BARDA . 
The University of Connecticut already has a microneedle patch that can deliver pneumonia vaccines . 
They are now testing a coronavirus vaccine in animals . 
BARDA gave them $ 430,000 . 
Vaxess Technologies spun out of research done at Tufts University and MIT . 
Its patch releases a vaccine over time . 
BARDA gave them $ 749,000 . 
California based biotech startup Verndari is creating a fast production , sugar based microneedle patch . 
BARDA awarded them $ 700,000 .
