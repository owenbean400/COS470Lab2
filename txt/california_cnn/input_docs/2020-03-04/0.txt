Ohio Gov . 
Mike De Wine announced that most events of the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus , Ohio , will be held without spectators this weekend based on guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on preventing the spread of coronavirus . 
The Arnold Sports Festival is an annual multi sport festival held in Columbus that includes the Arnold Classic , a bodybuilding competition named for Arnold Schwarzenegger . 
Schwarzenegger called the decision a " very sad moment for us , for my partners Jim Lorimer and Bob Lorimer , because we have been doing this now since 1976 when we held the first Mr . Olympia and Mr . Universe competition in Columbus , Ohio , and ever since we have been doing this without any interruption whatsoever . " 
The former California governor added , " Let me be very clear that we have the biggest and the best health and fitness festival in the world , but we would never choose making money over people â€™s health . "
