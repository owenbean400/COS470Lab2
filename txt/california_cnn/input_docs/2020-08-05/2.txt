New numbers show more than 1,500 Transportation Security Administration workers have now tested positive for coronavirus , but the agency hopes new protective shields at airport security checkpoints will help . 
The TSA announced that it has awarded a nearly $ 2.5 million contract to California based Lavi Industries . 
The company will build more than 1,200 acrylic barriers to be installed at 37 " priority " airports that the TSA considers are its busiest domestic hubs . 
The TSA said the barriers add to those already in place and will be installed this fall . 
" As long as this virus remains a threat , TSA will continue to implement the measures necessary for containment , " TSA Administrator David Pekoske said . 
TSA data shows that six workers have died from coronavirus , and more than 1,000 have recovered .
