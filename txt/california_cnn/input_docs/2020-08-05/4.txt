Rhode Island Gov . 
Gina Raimondo is rolling back reopening in the state with a last call for bars , restrictions on out of state travelers and limits on social gatherings . 
Anyone traveling into Rhode Island from 33 hot zone states , including Arizona , Texas , Florida , Georgia and California , will have to provide a negative Covid 19 test or must quarantine , she announced Wednesday . 
Travelers checking into a hotel or any kind of a rental property will " need to sign a certificate of compliance , verifying that they have had a negative test result , or that they intend to quarantine for 14 days while they are here , " Raimondo said . 
The National Guard will assist with informing travelers of the tightened restrictions at airports , she said . 
Raimondo said 20 % of bars inspected this weekend " were still not separating the bartender from the customer . " 
State officials have been " bending over backwards to keep the bars open " because they are " sympathetic to the fact that restaurants are barely making it , " she said . 
Raimondo then announced starting Friday , bars will not be allowed to operate after 11 p.m . More details : In an effort to crack down on gatherings , group sizes will now be reduced to 15 people or less , she said . 
Rhode Islanders should consider gathering with the same 15 people whenever possible , the governor said . 
Raimondo reminded residents the fine for violating the social gathering limit is $ 500 for each person found to be in violation .
