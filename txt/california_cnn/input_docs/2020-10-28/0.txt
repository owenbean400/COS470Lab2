The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) has released more than 250 detainees following a court order requiring government officials to reduce the overall detainee population at their processing center in Adelanto , California , where hundreds were infected in a coronavirus outbreak . 
The immigration detention facility in Southern California is one of the largest in the country and capable of housing up to 2,000 adults . 
It has reported 238 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday . 
Court order : US District Judge Terry Hatter Jr . ordered the reduction in population at the detention center on Oct . 15 after a class action lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) of Southern California . 
In his decision , the judge accused the government of " straight up dishonesty " and said the outbreak posed " an unreasonable risk to each detainee ’s safety . " 
ICE response : In a news release on Tuesday , ICE announced it would comply with the judge ’s order , which it said had resulted in " the release of dangerous criminal aliens into various communities . " 
According to the release , more than 85 % of the detainees at the Adelanto facility had pending criminal charges and/or convictions . 
Among those released , more than 60 % had final orders of removal by federal immigration judges . 
" These criminal aliens have serious convictions and charges – releasing them is an extremely risky gamble to take with public safety , " Pham added . 
" Fear mongering " : In a statement to CNN , ACLU senior counsel Ahilan Arulanantham said ICE has " a long history of fear mongering to justify their draconian practices . " 
The current population at the Adelanto facility is now approximately 465 , down from approximately 730 detainees before the judge ’s order , the news release states .
