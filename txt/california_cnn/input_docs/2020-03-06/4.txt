Health officials in California are investigating the death of a 72 year old Bay Area man who was previously on a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the coronavirus . 
The man , who has not been identified , died Thursday after officers were called to his home , where they found him " unconscious and not breathing " and were unable to resuscitate . 
While obtaining medical history on the patient , a family member advised officers that the man had recently been aboard a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the novel coronavirus , said Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety Chief Phan S . Ngo Ngo was not able to confirm which cruise ship the patient was on and said they have not yet determined if the patient had coronavirus . 
Autopsy results are pending and the Santa Clara County Public Health Department is investigating the case . 
Seven public safety officers who responded to the call were placed into a brief quarantine " out of an abundance of caution , " Ngo said . 
They have since been sent home , but have not been tested as they are not showing symptoms of the virus . 
Sunnyvale is in Northern California â€™s Santa Clara County , which currently has 20 confirmed cases .
