California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom intends to order the closure of all state beaches and parks starting Friday , according to a California Police Chiefs Association memo sent to police agencies across the state . 
A copy of the memo was provided to CNN by a senior law enforcement official . 
While the governor intends to make the announcement on Thursday , the memo was sent to police chiefs ahead of time to prepare law enforcement for the planned closures . 
According to the memo , state parks personnel will also help support local efforts . 
Newsom ’s office did not respond to CNN requests for comment . 
Crowded beaches : This comes after thousands of people packed beaches in Southern California ’s Orange and Ventura counties this past weekend , seeking relief from a heat wave . 
Earlier this week , Newsom chastised beachgoers and warned that defying the state ’s stay at home order could delay its reopening .
