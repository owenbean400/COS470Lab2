Covid 19 cases are on a dramatic rise in California , up 51.3 % in the past week . 
Daily cases have doubled in just 10 days , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom announced in a news conference Monday . 
California ’s positivity rate is 4.6 % today , but has jumped from its lowest point – 2.5 % – just one month ago . 
The state added at least 9,890 new cases Monday and has seen hospitalizations rise 48 % in the past two weeks . 
Just last week , the state reported its 1 millionth Covid 19 case . 
About 70 % of the counties in the state are moving backward into more restrictive tiers , with 41 of the 58 counties falling under the most restrictive of the state ’s four tiered reopening system . 
That includes all counties in Southern California , including Ventura , Los Angeles , Orange , and San Diego . 
In this most restrictive tier , where infections are considered widespread , guests are welcomed only outdoors at restaurants , gyms and places of worship . 
With Thanksgiving next week , Health Secretary Mark Ghaly urged Californians to " keep their guard up , even if they ’re with people that they love that they have not seen in a while . " 
California joined with Oregon and Washington on Friday , in issuing a travel advisory suggesting all residents avoid non essential travel . 
Travelers are implored to self quarantine for two weeks upon their arrival in to one of these West Coast states .
