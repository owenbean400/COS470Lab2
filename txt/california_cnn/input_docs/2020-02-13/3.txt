One coronavirus patient is in " very good condition and the other is in fair condition , " said UC San Diego Health Center ’s Dr . Randy Taplitz at a news conference this morning . 
A third is a " person under investigation , " she said . 
The patients are part of a group quarantined at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar . 
Earlier in the week , a woman with the novel coronavirus was sent back to Miramar instead of hospital isolation . 
Taplitz said she is confident the error will not happen again and attributes the problem to communication issues . 
She underscored that masks are not necessary for the general public because this virus is spread by large droplet not airborne spread . 
" So really the masks are not going to help you when you ’re walking down the street , " she Taplitz said .
