San Diego , California , Mayor Kevin Faulconer signed an executive order to allow local gyms , churches and salons to expand their businesses outdoors into private parking lots . 
Faulconer added that San Diego has seen its cases beginning to flatten over last week , however , they need more tests . 
As the $ 600 in federal unemployment benefits expire this week , the mayor said it is important for mayors to " provide the opportunity for businesses to be innovative and creative and do things they normally had not done outdoors " to get people employed . 
In response to Rep . 
Karen Bass â€™ claim that California reopened too quickly , Faulconer emphasized on a local approach . 
" We 're a big state , and one of the things we 've been advocating is follow what 's happening on the local level with our local county public health officials , " he said . 
" You reopen safely but you do it based upon the facts on the ground locally . "
