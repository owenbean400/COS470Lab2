Eight counties in California ’s Central Valley , where the coronavirus positivity rate has surged up to 18 % and caused a significant increase in hospitalizations , are seeing a disproportionate impact from Covid 19 , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said in a news conference on Monday . 
The Central Valley , home to the state ’s vast agricultural region , is seeing the highest transmission rates in the state , according to California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr . Mark Ghaly . 
The 14 day positivity rate in some counties has reached 18 % , Ghaly said . 
This is more than 10 % higher than the state ’s positivity rate at 7.5 % . 
Newsom said a $ 52 million federal government grant will be dispersed to the eight counties to improve isolation protocols , testing protocols , and provide more support and personnel in the health care industry . 
The funds will help support and protect the essential workforce that work in large processing plants where community spread and the likelihood of Covid 19 transmission is relatively high . 
New resources , including a strike team , will be deployed in all eight Central Valley counties . 
The teams will support efforts to unify engagement and mitigate the spread , Newsom said .
