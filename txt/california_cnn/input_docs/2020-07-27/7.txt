California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is investigating Amazon amid complaints about the company 's handling of worker safety during the coronavirus pandemic , according to a state judge . 
In addition to Becerra ’s office , the state ’s Division of Occupational Health and Safety ( Cal/OSHA ) and state public health officials are also conducting their own investigations , wrote San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman in a court filing Monday . 
Schulman ’s filing comes a week after Becerra ’s office acknowledged in a letter to the court that it had reached out to Amazon in May requesting information about how it is protecting California workers from Covid 19 . 
Becerra ’s office declined to comment . 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment . 
Ordinarily the attorney general ’s office does not " publicly disclose or comment on ongoing investigations , " the letter from Becerra ’s office read . 
But , it continued , Amazon itself disclosed the existence of the probe in its response to a lawsuit brought by a grocery picker at an Amazon Fresh fulfillment center in San Francisco . 
Schulman is the presiding judge in the case .
