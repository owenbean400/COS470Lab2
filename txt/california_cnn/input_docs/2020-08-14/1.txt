More than 96 % of California students will start the school year with distance learning , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said in a news conference . 
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to bear down on the west coast , schooling remains a top concern for students , teachers , and parents . 
How remote learning will work : Only 71 % of districts are confident that students will have the technology needed for online learning . 
As such , California has partnered with many tech and office supply companies to ensure each student has a laptop or tablet and access to Wi Fi . 
There is a run on supplies nationwide , but many companies are prioritizing schools in providing the needed devices , State Superintendent Tony Thurmond said . 
" These circumstances are not ideal as students return to school , " Thurmond said , " but students continue to learn , even under these conditions . " 
Educators are leaning in , State School Board President Linda Darling Hammond , said . 
" We 've come a long way since spring , " Darling Hammond said . 
She believes that when it is time to go back to the classroom , students and teachers will return more technologically proficient .
