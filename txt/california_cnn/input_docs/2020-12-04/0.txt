More than 1,000 migrant children in US government custody have tested positive for coronavirus since March , according to the federal agency charged with their care . 
In total , there have been 1,061 lab confirmed Covid 19 cases among unaccompanied migrant children in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement , a federal agency that falls under the Health and Human Services Department . 
Of the 1,061 cases , 943 children have recovered and been moved from medical isolation , according to the agency . 
Currently , 118 children have tested positive and remain in medical isolation , though none of the children have required hospitalization . 
HHS funds a network of more than 100 shelters where migrant children who arrived in the United States without parents or guardians are provided care until they 're released to sponsors . 
Children who have had coronavirus while in care were in shelters in New York , Oregon , Texas , Illinois , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Arizona , Virginia , California , and Florida . 
In a November court declaration , the acting ORR director , Nicole Cubbage , suggested that children are becoming infected prior to entering custody . 
The Trump administration has argued that children should be swiftly removed from the United States after being apprehended from the southern border â€“ a change from prior practice which required children be turned over to HHS after being taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security . 
Last month , a federal judge blocked the administration from turning back unaccompanied migrant children at the US Mexico border under a public health order implemented in March . 
The administration has since appealed the ruling .
