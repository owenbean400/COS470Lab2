Six San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions issued a stay at home order Friday ahead of the governor ’s statewide mandate , restricting activities and limiting capacity at businesses in an effort to reduce the spread of Covid 19 as hospitals and intensive care units see a surge of patients . 
The regional order applies to the Northern California counties of Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Santa Clara , San Francisco and the city of Berkeley . 
The order , which will affect more than 5.8 million people , speeds up the timeline of the statewide regional stay at home order announced Thursday by California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom . 
Under the new local health orders , businesses will be required to further reduce occupancy to 20 % , and will be required to write and enforce plans to ensure proper face coverings and maximum capacity rules are followed . 
Restaurants must close outdoor operations and convert to takeout and delivery only . 
Hair cutting and nail cutting services have also been ordered to close , officials said . 
The new health orders will go into effect Dec . 6 and will remain in effect until Jan . 4 , Contra Costa Health Director Chris Farnitano said . 
The Bay Area was projected to be the last region in the state to be subject to the governor ’s stay at home order , predicted to surpass the threshold by mid to late December . 
But Friday ’s decision means the region will instead be the first .
