California is breaking a grim record , reporting 197 Covid related deaths in a single day , according to the state 's Department of Public Health . 
This report far outpaces the previous high of 159 from just last week . 
Also climbing in the state are daily cases . 
California added 8,755 new cases , bringing the state ’s cumulative total to 475,305 cases . 
Today 's marked increase in cases may be the result of a backlog in test results , as noted by Health Secretary Mark Ghaly Tuesday . 
The positivity rate appears steady at 7.4 % over the past 14 days . 
Nearly 100,000 tests were conducted yesterday and more than 7.5 million have been performed in California to date . 
Hospitalization rates also remain stable over the past several days . 
Los Angeles County still holds the most coronavirus cases in the state , but as cases climb elsewhere , it currently makes up for only about 37 % of all California cases , down from nearly 50 % earlier in the pandemic . 
That may be short lived as Los Angeles County Public Health " anticipates receiving a backlog in cases in the coming days due to previous reporting delays in the State electronic lab system . " 
Note : These numbers were released by California Department of Public Health , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
