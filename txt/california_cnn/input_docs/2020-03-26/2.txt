Two people who were passengers on the Grand Princess Cruise have died due to coronavirus , according to a statement from US Department of Health and Human Services . 
The Grand Princess , which was carrying 3,500 passengers and crew members , docked at the Port of Oakland earlier this month after at least 21 people tested positive for coronavirus . 
The cruise , a 2 week trip from San Francisco to Hawaii , was interrupted after officials learned a California man contracted coronavirus and died on a previous trip .
