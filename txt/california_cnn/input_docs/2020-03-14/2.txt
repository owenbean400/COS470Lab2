Vice President Pence attempted to clarify when the Google website on the coronavirus , which was announced at yesterday ’s Rose Garden press conference , would be widely available . 
At a White House briefing Saturday , Pence said Google is planning to launch the website on Monday , but added that launch will only be available in the San Francisco Bay Area . 
He said the goal is to expand that site to other areas of the country . 
CNN ’s Jake Tapper reports that California leaders were stunned Friday to see their graphic for a modest pilot program the state has been working on developing with Google ’s parent company Alphabet presented by the White House as if it were a Trump administration program that was a nationwide initiative and ready to go according to a knowledgeable source . 
Google said Friday night the company will not be publishing a national scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon , contrary to claims made by President Trump during the Friday Rose Garden briefing .
