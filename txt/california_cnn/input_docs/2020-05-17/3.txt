A drop in child abuse would usually be welcome news –– but with schools closed and kids at home , experts believe that the recent decline in calls to child abuse and neglect hotlines might really mean more cases are going unnoticed .

Children 's advocates say they 're also having a harder time finding ways to intervene before abuse starts in at risk families . 
Paula Wolfteich , intervention and clinical director of the National Children 's Advocacy Center , told CNN that mitigation measures have hampered their contact with at risk families and handicapped the organization 's ability to help .
