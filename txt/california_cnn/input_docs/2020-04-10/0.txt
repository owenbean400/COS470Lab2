Additionally , all other UFC events have been postponed indefinitely . 
UFC 249 had been moved to Tachi Palace Casino Resort near Fresno , California . 
On Thursday , US Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement that the event should be postponed . 
" I 'm concerned by reports that Ultimate Fighting Championship plans to hold a pay per view event in California , in defiance of the state â€™s shelter in place order , " Feinstein said . 
" This event would involve dozens of individuals flying to California and driving to a casino for a purpose no one can honestly claim is essential . "
