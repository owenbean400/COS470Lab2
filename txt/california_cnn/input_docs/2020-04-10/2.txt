About 74 miles of Oakland , California , streets will be closed to give bicyclists and pedestrians more room to spread out during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Mayor Libby Schaaf gave a preview of the new initiative , dubbed Oakland Slow Streets , in a virtual town hall Thursday night . 
Parks are too crowded to maintain proper physical distancing , Chief Resilience Officer Alexandra Mc Bride noted , so the city 's creative solution is to take advantage of the 20 % to 30 % of land dedicated to roads . 
City streets will close roads to vehicular traffic mostly in and around residential neighborhoods . 
The official rollout of this emergency and details are expected to be released later today .
