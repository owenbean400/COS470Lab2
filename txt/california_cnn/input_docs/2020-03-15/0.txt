After confusion and contradicting claims yesterday , Google now says it is working with the federal government to develop a nationwide website containing information about coronavirus symptoms and testing . 
The company did not give a time frame of when the website would be up . 
This comes after a previous denial : On Friday , after President Trump claimed Google was developing this website , the company said it would not be publishing a national scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon . 
Instead , a health focused subsidiary owned by Google ’s parent company , Alphabet , said it intended to launch a small scale website next week to begin to triage California based patients . 
The website would aim to serve a broader population only " over time " — not " very quickly . " 
In a different tweet Saturday night , the company did also mention the pilot website in the San Francisco area .
