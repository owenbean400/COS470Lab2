An American coronavirus patient was admitted to the UC Davis Medical Center last Wednesday but was not tested until Sunday , according to a letter obtained by CNN that was sent to staff at UC Davis . 
This patient , a resident of Solano County , is the 15th confirmed case in the US . 
When the patient was transferred from another Northern California hospital last week , testing was requested -- but neither Sacramento County nor the California Department of Public Health was doing coronavirus testing at the time . 
On Sunday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) ordered testing for the patient and results came back positive today . 
The patient was put on airborne and strict contact precautions due to the patient â€™s condition , according to the letter . 
Community transmission : The patient is being investigated by the CDC as " possibly the first patient to have received the infection from exposure in the community . " 
The letter also asks a small number of employees to stay home and monitor their temperature out of an abundance of caution .
