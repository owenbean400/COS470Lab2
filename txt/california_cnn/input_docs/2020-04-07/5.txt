California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom announced that shipments of ventilators will arrive in hotspots in New York , New Jersey and Illinois as early as Tuesday night , as his state began flying a surplus of 500 ventilators to states in need . 
" One hundred going to New York , 100 going to New Jersey , 100 going to Illinois , " Newsom , a Democrat , told reporters Tuesday . 
He continued : " The Vice President was correct ventilators are going to DC , Delaware , ventilators are going to Maryland , and likely Nevada . 
So that was the determination ; it was done through the collective wisdom of our partners at FEMA ... it was done in collaboration with their expectation and needs of what is required of the moment on the ground , based upon that data , and that collaborative engagement , we made this determinations working together , including with the vice president and his ( White House coronavirus ) task force . " 
Newsom said the 500 ventilators are being loaned after the state was able to refurbish and purchase sufficient equipment for the states own needs . 
" Because we feel we 're adequately resourced for the moment — again , in a dynamic world , where things can change , and we 're confident that the number of ventilators that we currently have in possession are adequate to the task in the very short term , " he said . 
The ventilators being shipped are part of California ’s own supply , and are being distributed as a loan .
