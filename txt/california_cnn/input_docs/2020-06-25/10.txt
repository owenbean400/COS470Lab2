The number of Californians hospitalized with the coronavirus and being treated in intensive care units has climbed by a double digit percentage to record highs over the last two weeks as the state sees a surge of new infections . 
Hospitals in California have seen a 32 % increase in patients with the coronavirus over the last 14 day period , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said at a news conference Thursday , reaching an all time high since the start of the pandemic . 
As of Wednesday , the latest day for which data is available , 4,240 patients were hospitalized with the coronavirus in California , an increase of 145 patients since Tuesday , or 3.5 % . 
The number of Californians being treated in intensive care units has also reached a record high , with 1,306 patients on Wednesday — a 19 % increase over the last 14 days . 
Across the state , 34 % of California 's intensive care unit beds are occupied with Covid 19 patients . 
The governor suggested the state could pause further reopening of its economy — and even " toggle back " — if health officials continue to see increases in infections and hospitalizations . 
" To the extent we do not see progress being made , and we 're not advancing the cause of public health and public safety , then we certainly reserve the right to put a pause in terms of advancing into the subsequent phase , " Newsom said . 
" And we have the capacity and ability to toggle back in terms of the stay at home order and the guidance that we put out . "
