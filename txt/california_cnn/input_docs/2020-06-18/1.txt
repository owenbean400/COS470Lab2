When San Francisco implemented its shelter in place order in mid March , coronavirus continued to spread through the city ’s Hispanic population in parts of the densely populated Mission District , researchers at the University of California , San Francisco reported Thursday . 
For the first six weeks the ordinance was in place , the virus continued to spread among the low income Latino population in a crowded 16 block area of the district , they found . 
The team at UCSF worked with the San Francisco Department of Health , the state of California and community organizers on an initiative offering free Covid 19 tests , both nasal swab tests to diagnose active infections and antibody tests to find past infections . 
They reached almost 4,000 people in the area between April 25-28 . 
The results : They found that 2 % of those given a PCR test – the most accurate type of diagnostic test – were infected with Covid 19 at the time of the test . 
Among those who tested positive , infection rates were almost 20 times higher for Hispanic residents than non Hispanics and 3.5 times higher among immigrant workers than for residents in the district . 
Antibody tests indicated 6 % of residents had contracted the virus at some point since the beginning of the pandemic , the researchers said in their pre print report , which has not yet been peer reviewed . 
After comparing the tests , researchers reported , " the vast majority ( 96 % ) of new infections were occurring in the Latinx community , whereas those infected earlier in the pandemic were somewhat more representative of the neighborhood as a whole ( 67 % Latinx , 16 % white and 17 % other ) . " 
Many of those infected could not work from home and could not miss work . 
Other risk factors for those contracting the virus later , in late April , for example , included frontline service work , unemployment and a household income of less than $ 50,000 a year .
