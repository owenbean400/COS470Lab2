California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom on Monday announced the state will independently review the safety of any FDA approved Covid 19 vaccine before it is distributed in the state . 
An 11 member task force of health experts , dubbed the " Scientific Safety Review Workgroup , " will review the safety and efficacy of vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration before distribution in the nation â€™s most populous state , Newsom said . 
The vaccines currently in development will initially be available in limited supply and will be prioritized to health care workers , first responders , and higher risk groups , according to Newsom . 
" We do not anticipate mass availability until 2021 , " Newsom said . 
While the state is expected to receive about 1.5 to 2 million vaccines , Newsom said the state has approximately that many people working in the health care system . 
The governor also discussed the challenging storage requirements for these vaccines , which need to be stored with dry ice and in extremely cold temperatures . 
Each distribution of vaccination has to occur on a 21 day period , he said . 
Newsom warned that the vaccines wo not end the coronavirus overnight , but will be a key tool to help manage the pandemic . 
He urged people to continue wearing masks and physically distance .
