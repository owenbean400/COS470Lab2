More than two dozen people from at least three California counties are infected with Covid 19 after participating in youth basketball tournaments in the city of Rocklin earlier this month , according to Placer County Health officials . 
The health department urges anyone who was at Courtside Basketball Center on Nov . 7 or Nov . 8 to quarantine and seek testing regardless of symptoms . 
They said residents should avoid participating in all indoor activities at the facility and did not identify the other two counties tied to the tournaments . 
The county is in the state ’s most restrictive purple tier of the state ’s four level color coded system and only outdoor operations are allowed . 
The weekend of the tournaments , Placer County was in the orange tier indicating moderate spread level . 
Gyms and fitness centers can be open for indoor operations with modifications and a 25 % maximum capacity , according to state guidelines . 
" This Health Alert is being issued because of the large scale of the apparent outbreak and potential range that make contact tracing difficult . 
In addition , the facility has refused to cease indoor operations and continues to host tournaments despite being advised such operations are not allowed and the full knowledge that COVID 19 cases have been associated with activities at the facility , " the release continued . 
The basketball center is hosting a Thanksgiving camp that continues today , according to information on the company ’s website . 
CNN is requesting comment from Courtside Basketball Center .
