There are not nearly enough Americans using masks to bend the curve on the coronavirus infection rate , the head of one of the main teams forecasting the pandemic said Friday . 
The University of Washington ’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) revised its forecast this week for coronavirus deaths because of rising infection rates and because too few Americans were using face masks regularly , IHME ’s Dr . Chris Murray told CNN . 
This week ’s IHME forecast of 230,822 US deaths from the virus by November is up about 11,000 from last week ’s projection of 219,864 deaths . 
The model projects that if almost all Americans wore face masks , the number of deaths by November would drop by around 32,000 , to just below 199,000 deaths . 
Murray says the " good news " is that cases are peaking in Florida , Texas , California and somewhat in Arizona , which is bringing their numbers down a bit . 
" But we 're seeing numbers going up faster in a whole series of states in the Midwest . 
And that 's driving up our numbers . 
Places , also , like Georgia and North Carolina are going up faster than we expected , " he said .
