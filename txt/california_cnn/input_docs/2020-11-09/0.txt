Coronavirus rates are rising quickly in California with cases , positivity rate , hospitalizations , and the number of people in intensive care all climbing . 
Hospitalizations are up 28.6 % over the past two weeks and the number of patients in ICU has increased 27.3 % over the past three weeks , Governor Gavin Newsom announced Monday . 
The positivity rate has gone up significantly in that time frame , from a low of 2.5 % on October 19 to 3.7 % today . 
Newsom said the reason for the increase was obvious . 
Testing for coronavirus is also climbing in California , with 194,000 tests conducted on Sunday . 
" We anticipated seeing more cases with increased testing , but the positivity rate is a better indicator of what â€™s actually happening , " Newsom said . 
Newsom said he expects an announcement on Tuesday that some counties will move backwards in the state 's tier system . 
For some areas , that could include closing some non essential business and reinstituting stricter health orders .
