Southern California counties could face a stay at home order after the percentage of available intensive care unit beds in the region dropped below 15 % , the threshold set by new measure announced by Gov . 
Gavin Newsom earlier this week . 
On Friday night , the percentage of available ICU beds in the Southern California region dropped to 13.1 % , according to data released by the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) . 
Newsom divided California into five regions in order to best monitor and regulate Covid 19 in the state : Northern California , Bay Area , Greater Sacramento , San Joaquin Valley and Southern California . 
The Southern California Region includes 11 counties : Imperial , Inyo , Los Angeles , Mono , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino , San Diego , San Luis Obispo , Santa Barbara and Ventura counties . 
The new Regional Stay Home Order , which is aimed at stopping the Covid 19 surge and preventing overwhelming regional ICU capacity in the state , " prohibits private gatherings of any size , closes sector operations except for critical infrastructure and retail , and requires 100 % masking and physical distancing in all others , " among other things according to the order .
