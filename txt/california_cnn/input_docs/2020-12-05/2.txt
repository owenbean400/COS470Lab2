As Covid 19 infections surge across California , state correctional facilities have recorded more than 4,000 active cases among inmates and another 1,430 among staff -- the highest numbers recorded since the pandemic 's start . 
That means California 's total number of inmate infections is now up to more than 22,300 , including 90 deaths . 
That translates to about 227 Covid 19 cases per 1,000 over the course of the pandemic -- or some 20 % of the total inmate population , according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ( CDCR ) . 
Statewide among the public , that number is about 32 cases per 1,000 people . 
The soaring numbers across prison facilities come as local and state officials are also trying to control a rampant spread across California 's communities . 
On Friday , the state shattered its previous case record , reporting more than 22,000 new cases . 
Hospitalizations are also at record high levels , with more than 9,900 Covid 19 patients across the state -- about 2,200 of whom are in intensive care units . 
Gov . 
Gavin Newsom , saying the state was at " a tipping point in our fight against the virus , " announced a strict regional stay at home order this week , which will go into effect 48 hours after ICU capacity drops below 15 % in one of five regions , Northern California , the Bay Area , Greater Sacramento , the San Joaquin Valley or Southern California .
