Michael Schill , chairman of the Pac 12 CEO Group , said the uncertainty of the coronavirus ultimately factored into the conference 's decision to postpone the fall college football season . 
Schill , who is also the president of the University of Oregon , said that it was unfair to students and coaches to keep delaying the season . 
" Some people say ' Oh , it 's just football ; oh , it 's just volleyball or track . ’ 
These are students ' lives , right ? 
They dream about this , " he said . 
" This was not an easy decision … and this is also a very costly decision for the universities , " he added . 
The range of states that are included in the Pac 12 conference was also a factor in the decision . 
" We include California , Utah , Oregon , Washington , Colorado , [ a ] big variety of states . 
We do not even have the permission of government authorities to play in some of those areas , and the spread in some of those areas is quite significant , " he said . 
He said they are hoping to still have a spring season but will continue to assess all factors .
