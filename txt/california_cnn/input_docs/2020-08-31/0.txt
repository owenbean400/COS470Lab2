For students from Meraki High School outside Sacramento , California , staying fit during the coronavirus pandemic has been as easy as playing solitaire . 
Since the school shut down this spring , its students have taken part in a modified physical education class with the help of a special deck of " Super Fitness Fun Cards . " 
The cards have different exercises on each one . 
Students can shuffle the cards , take a predetermined number of them , then do the exercises that the cards depict . 
The tool is the brainchild of Dan De Jager , physical literacy and wellness advisor at the school in Fair Oaks , California . 
De Jager is a self proclaimed " gaming nerd , " and uses the deck in conjunction with instructional videos , Zoom meetings and scavenger hunts to keep kids interested in physical education while they 're engaged in virtual learning . 
" It 's a great brain break , " he said of the cards . 
" Even if you do not feel like you 're working hard , just getting regular exercise can make a huge difference in your day . "
