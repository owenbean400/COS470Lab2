Princess Cruises is offering thousands of stranded passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship a full refund , according to a letter sent to guests by the cruise line on Sunday . 
The Grand Princess , docked off the California coast , has been in limbo since Wednesday , when officials learned a California man who traveled on the same ship last month later died of coronavirus . 
In the letter obtained by CNN , the cruise line told travelers that all monies paid to Princess Cruises as well as air fare accommodations will be reimbursed . 
Each guest will also receive a future cruise credit equal to 100 % of the cruise fare paid for the current voyage , according to the letter . 
Ship under quarantine : There are currently 21 people confirmed with coronavirus aboard the ship , which is expected to dock sometime today in Oakland , California . 
Among the infected on the ship are 19 crew members and two passengers , though the number of onboard infections could rise , as not all of the approximately 3,500 people on board -- including passengers and crew -- have been tested . 
About 1,000 California residents from the ship will go into mandatory quarantine at Travis Air Force Base and Miramar Naval Air Station , the US Department of Health and Human Services said Sunday .
