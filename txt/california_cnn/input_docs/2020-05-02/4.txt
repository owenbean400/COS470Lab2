Austin Beutner , the superintendent of the Los Angles Unified School District , said reopening schools will be complicated because of the number of people who are impacted . 
For example , one of the schools in the district has 500 students , Beutner told CNN 's Fredricka Whitfield . 
Those 500 students have siblings who are in schools with about 50,000 more students , who go home to about 200,000 family members , he said . 
One school with 500 individuals [ is ] connected to a quarter million people , " Beutner said . 
" We do not want the quarter million people bringing the virus into the school and the school to spread and be a petri dish to share with the rest of the community . " 
Some background : On Tuesday , California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom floated the idea of restarting school in late July or early August , saying that " the prospects of an earlier school year are warranted considering the prospect of neglecting our next generation . " 
Local school officials would develop new protocols for physical education classes and recess at schools , as well as processes to deeply clean and sanitize schools , parks and playgrounds to keep infection rates down , Newsom said when discussing his plan on how to reopen the sate .
