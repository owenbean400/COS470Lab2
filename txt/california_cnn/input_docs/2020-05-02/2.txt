A California couple was arrested at a Hawaii hotel on Thursday for allegedly violating the island state 's mandatory 14 day quarantine for travelers . 
Officials say the couple , from California 's Citrus Heights , came to Honolulu on their honeymoon and arrived at the hotel late Wednesday , when a front desk manager informed them about the self quarantine order . 
The couple allegedly told the manager that airport personnel told them contradictory information , and after further discussion of the rules , the Californians " scoffed at him again and then left the hotel , " according to a press release from Hawaii 's COVID 19 Joint Information Center . 
The couple , aged 20 and 26 , subsequently returned to the hotel with a pizza after midnight , and refused to sign the quarantine acknowledgment , officials say . 
The couple was informed again Thursday morning that they were in violation of the state â€™s quarantine requirements before being arrested , according to the release . 
Hawaii Gov . 
David Ige issued a mandatory 14 day quarantine for all passengers arriving in the state after March 26 , and continuing through May 31 .
