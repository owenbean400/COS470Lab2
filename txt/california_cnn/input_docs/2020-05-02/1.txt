Editor 's note : Kara Alaimo , an associate professor of public relations at Hofstra University , was spokeswoman for international affairs in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration . 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own . 
Early Wednesday morning , Tesla CEO and self styled futurist Elon Musk called on Twitter for the government to " FREE AMERICA NOW . " 
He also tweeted , " Give people their freedom back ! " 
On a Tesla earnings call later that day , Musk called stay at home orders " fascist . " 
His words were tone deaf and , for someone with over 33 million Twitter followers to call on the government to end its lockdown , they were also dangerous . 
Musk is advocating for behavior that would lead to more Covid 19 related deaths in the US . 
And while Musk did later tweet , " Yes , reopen with care & appropriate protection , but do not put everyone under de facto house arrest , " we are not there yet . 
Musk is perhaps frustrated because Tesla factories in New York and California have been shuttered for the time being . 
Perhaps he thinks that he can tweet them open and help his car business . 
If this is the case , he is likely to be sorely mistaken . 
Americans are a lot smarter than Musk is revealing himself to be , and though Tesla reported a Q1 profit -- a surprise to many -- this week , I predict that Musk 's ill advised tweets will negatively impact his business . 
In fact , the factory was only closed in March after appearing to operate in violation of a county order limiting activities of nonessential businesses for days . 
If Musk feels this strongly about opening up the country , then he should tell the public exactly how he plans on safely getting his factory workers back to work .
