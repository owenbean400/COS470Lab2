California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom ordered all Orange County beaches closed on Thursday despite a vote from the Newport Beach City Council Tuesday to keep beaches open , the release said . 
" The Governor ’s office had not sought the City ’s perspective on beach safety or the weekend plan before issuing the directive , " the Newport Beach release said . 
On Friday , an Orange County judge rejected a request from local officials to block Newsom 's order closing the beaches in the county to slow the spread of the coronavirus . 
Lawyers representing three cities argued the governor had singled out the county and overstepped his authority while allowing other beaches in California to remain open . 
The judge agreed to hear more on the challenges to the beach order next week . 
Also on Friday , between 2,500 and 3,000 people took part in a protest over the beach closures in Huntington Beach .
