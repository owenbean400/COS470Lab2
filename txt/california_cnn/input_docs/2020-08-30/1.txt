For a few hours every Saturday , Los Angeles ' Skid Row -- home to one of the nation 's largest concentrations of homeless people -- transforms into an outdoor beauty salon . 
There , where tents line city blocks , people gather to get makeovers from Shirley Raines , or one of her team of volunteers , made up of licensed hair stylists , barbers , makeup artists . 
Raines came up with the idea for her non profit , Beauty 2 The Streets , after recognizing that a haircut , a new hair color and makeup can help homeless people to thrive . 
When California ordered all its residents to stay at home in late March due to the coronavirus , Raines and her volunteers complied . 
But the following Monday , she found messages on her social media from community members who were alone and hungry . 
" I realized that we did not have the luxury of self isolating because we built this relationship with the community so we need to still go out there and help them . " 
Homeless people are very vulnerable to Covid 19 because they live in close quarters and have limited access to cleaning facilities . 
So the team began handing out food , hand sanitizer and water , while adhering to distancing guidelines and wearing masks . 
Still , the desire for beauty products is there , Raines said , so they have been slowly bringing out wigs , makeup , combs and brushes so homeless people can style themselves . 
She said if there 's anything to learn from the pandemic , it 's that " any one of us could be them ( homeless ) at any given time . "
