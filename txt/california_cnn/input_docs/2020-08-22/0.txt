The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in the United States could spike to as high as 6,000 people a day by December in the worst case scenario , according to Dr . Chris Murray , the chair of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) at the University of Washington . 
Currently , about 1,000 people are dying daily from the coronavirus in the US . 
In a new model released Friday , researchers at IHME predicted the number of daily deaths will decrease slowly in September -- then rise to nearly 2,000 a day by the start of December . 
But Murray told CNN that , " depending on what our leaders do , " things can get worse . 
The new IHME forecast projects 310,000 deaths by December -- 15,000 more than the previous forecast two weeks ago . 
That â€™s because while coronavirus infections are dropping in some areas , the death rate is not . 
" In some states -- California is a good example -- cases peaked , are coming down , but deaths have not , " Murray said . 
" We 're seeing upswings in transmission in places like Kentucky and Minnesota , Indiana . " 
If mask use increased in the US to 95 % , the number of deaths could drop by almost 70,000 , Murray added .
