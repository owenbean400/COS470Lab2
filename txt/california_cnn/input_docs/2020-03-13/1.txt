Singapore will cease port calls for all cruise vessels , effective immediately , according to the country 's Maritime and Port Authority . 
In a news release today , the Maritime and Port Authority said that the new measure barring cruise ships was implemented to minimize the risk of community spread of the coronavirus . 
Singapore has 187 confirmed cases of the virus , according to the World Health Organization . 
The measure comes after several cruise ships , most famously the Diamond Princess , were docked under quarantine with infected cases found on board . 
Just this week , the Grand Princess cruise ship docked off the California coast had cases confirmed aboard and all passengers were sent to government quarantine centers .
