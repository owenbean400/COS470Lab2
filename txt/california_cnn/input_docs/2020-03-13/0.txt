The next three tournaments on the Ladies Professional Golf Association ( LGPA ) Tour -- including the first women ’s golf major of the year -- have been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak . 
The LPGA is the American organization for female professional golfers . 
The Founders Cup in Arizona , the Kia Classic and the ANA Inspiration in California – which were due to take place in March and early April – have been suspended . 
The LPGA says it hopes they can be rescheduled for later in the season . 
Men 's tournaments have also been postponed : The men ’s PGA Players Championship in Florida was canceled after one round , with organizers saying it was " the right thing to do " during the coronavirus outbreak . 
The event is not a major championship but is often referenced as " The Fifth Major " given its status in the golfing calendar . 
The PGA Tour has also stopped all play until the Valero Texas Open , which is scheduled to begin on April 2 . 
The Masters – the first men ’s major of 2020 – is due to start a week later at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta , Georgia .
