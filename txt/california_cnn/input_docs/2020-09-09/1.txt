Small businesses stunted by coronavirus closures will be eligible for tax relief in California thanks to new legislation signed into law today . 
Gov . 
Gavin Newsom signed SB 1447 , which expands Covid related assistance programs specifically for California â€™s small business and establishes a hiring tax credit . 
Each small business that re hires an employee once stay at home orders are lifted will receive a $ 1,000 credit toward their tax liability , as explained by state Sen . 
Anna Caballero , who sponsored the bill . 
The new relief is expected to cost California about $ 100 million , Newsom estimated .
