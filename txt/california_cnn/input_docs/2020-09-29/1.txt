Several populous counties in California are being allowed to reopen further as they move into less restrictive tiers , Health Secretary Dr . Mark Ghaly announced Tuesday . 
Sacramento , Fresno and Santa Barbara are among seven counties moving from the most restrictive purple tier into the next level , red . 
In the red tier , which indicates a substantial spread of infection , churches , museums , and movie theaters are allowed to reopen . 
San Francisco moves from the red to orange tier , which shows a moderate infection rate , along with Amador and Calaveras counties . 
Bars , wineries , bowling alleys , and offices will now be allowed to reopen in those areas . 
California has four tiers based on metrics including case rate and tests positivity over a number of consecutive weeks . 
Ghaly said that the state will be soon adding a health equity metric as well . 
On the heels of a letter signed by 19 California legislators urging the reopening of theme parks , Ghaly echoed Gov . 
Gavin Newsom â€™s promise that new guidelines are coming soon .
