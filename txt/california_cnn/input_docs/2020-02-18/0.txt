Carl Goldman , 66 , and his wife , Jeri Seratti Goldman , were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise when the ship became quarantined in Japan 's Yokohama port . 
Now , one of the 13 evacuees who just arrived at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha , he recalls his experiences so far . 
However , by the time he , his wife , and the other Diamond Princess passengers were being evacuated to the US , Goldman , who is from Santa Clarita , California , began to show symptoms . 
" I had a high fever on the flight and they took my temperature and I wound up in a section of the plane that is isolated , " Goldman said . 
" They put me there with other people they suspected of having the virus . 
The section was sealed off with big sheets of plastic . " 
Goldman , who was first taken to Travis Air Force Base , landed in Omaha this morning . 
" I am being tended to by two nurses in full hazmat suits and the doctor who visited me was also in a hazmat suit , " he said . 
" My wife and I are in separate wings of this facility and we â€™re talking to each other via Facetime . " 
Goldman and his wife are now awaiting test results for the novel coronavirus .
