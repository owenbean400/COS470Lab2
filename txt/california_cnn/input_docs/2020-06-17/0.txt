Certain California inmates who have 180 days or fewer to serve on their sentences will be released to help protect staff and other prisoners from the spread of the coronavirus , the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced Tuesday . 
Eligible inmates under CDCR â€™s new community supervision plan , which is scheduled to begin on July 1 , include those who are not currently serving time for domestic violence , a violent or serious crime , or a person required to register as a sex offender , according to a news release from the department . 
The inmate must also have housing plans identified before participating in the program and will remain under close supervision for the duration of their sentence , up to 180 days , the news release states . 
After serving the remainder of their time at home , " they will remain on state parole supervision , transfer to county post release community supervision , or discharge from their sentence , depending on their post release requirements . " 
The news release also notes that inmates participating in the community supervision program can be remanded back to state prison for any reason to serve the remainder of their sentence . 
CDCR has reduced the inmate population by more than 8,000 since mid March through the suspension of county jail intake and expediting parole of approximately 3,500 inmates in April , according to the news release .
