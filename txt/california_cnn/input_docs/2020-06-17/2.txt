Los Angeles recorded 2,175 new coronavirus cases in the county , another single day high . 
As in past reports , Health Director Barbara Ferrer attributed the spike to lagging test reports . 
The daily case count is hard to interpret , Ferrer said , and indicated that the key metric for the county is hospitalization rates , which are steady at about 1,300 patients . 
The average daily death rate is steadily decreasing and has gone from about 45 fatalities each day in early May to about 35 deaths now , Ferrer said . 
The rate in Los Angeles remains at about 8 % . 
While much of California continues to reopen business sectors , Los Angeles is lagging behind somewhat in a continued effort to mitigate new cases . 
It is unclear if any of the cases might be linked to recent protests , but contact tracing efforts are continuing , Ferrer said .
