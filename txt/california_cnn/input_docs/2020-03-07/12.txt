The first patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus in Utah did not know that there had been an outbreak among their fellow Grand Princess cruise ship passengers until they returned home . 
The Utah Department of Health said in an earlier news release that the resident had contracted the coronavirus while onboard the Grand Princess , which is anchored off the coast of California under quarantine . 
Utah state officials said that the cruise line informed the patient of the outbreak after they got home , and then the passenger went to a clinic to be checked . 
State epidemiologist Angela Dunn said there were other Utah residents on the cruise , and they are reaching out to those passengers to encourage them to watch for potential symptoms . 
People who live with the confirmed patient are also being tested for the coronavirus , and they are looking for other people who were in close contact .
