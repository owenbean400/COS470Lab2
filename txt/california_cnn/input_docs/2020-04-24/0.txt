Since March 14 , 26.5 million American have filed unemployment claims seeking financial relief -- and families are struggling to feed themselves . 
In Miami , more than 1,000 families slept in their cars to keep their place in line outside a food distribution center . 
Around 10,000 people showed up to a similar food distribution in San Antonio . 
" We have a humanitarian food crisis on our hands , " said celebrity chef José Andrés , whose program World Central Kitchen is working to provide meals to people and first responders . 
Speaking during CNN 's coronavirus global town hall , Andrés urged government officials to address the growing crisis and set aside partisan conflicts . 
" This is not about Republicans or Democrats . 
This is about Americans , we the people . 
Many people right now as they are losing their jobs , they are in desperate need of somebody to be feeding them , " he said . 
This is not the first time Andrés has cooked in disaster scenarios : He also helped cook for those affected in the Bahamas during Hurricane Dorian , and after Hurricane Maria , Hurricane Florence and the California wildfires . 
Andrés and his team also helped cook for federal government workers who were furloughed or working without pay during the 35 day partial shutdown last January .
