The surge in Covid 19 cases in California continues and as state officials take measures to slow the spread of the virus , Ventura County â€™s public health officer Dr . Robert Levin said the state reopened too quickly . 
" I think we did open too quickly in terms of this being purely a virus question . 
Part of what drove us to open at all and at the rate we did was concerns about getting our economy moving . 
And of course , one can easily make an argument that having a robust economy is a public health issue as well . " 
The US is also witnessing more younger people contracting coronavirus during this surge in cases , and Levin stressed the importance of this information . 
Levin also expressed concern about the growing number of cases despite California being early to issue a stay at home order at the onset of the pandemic to get it under control . 
" One month ago , we were having 20 hospitalized patients due to Covid across our county pretty much on a daily basis . 
The most recent report has us in the high 60s . 
This is a dramatic thing , and I ca not help but be very concerned about it . "
