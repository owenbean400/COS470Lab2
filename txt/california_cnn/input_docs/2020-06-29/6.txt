All bars , wineries and breweries in San Diego County are ordered to temporarily close beginning July 1 , county health officials announced Monday . 
This comes as several California counties are dialing back plans to reopen some businesses after observing a decrease in compliance with social distancing guidelines and an increase in hospitalizations . 
" We will take action to close bars wineries and breweries that do not serve food beginning midnight Wednesday morning , " Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten said Monday . 
" Now more than ever , it is vital that we all take precaution to guide our personal , as well as our collective health . " 
Bars represent 27 % of all of San Diego County 's active community setting outbreaks , Wooten added . 
San Diego currently has 65 active outbreaks , the county 's data shows . 
Over the weekend , California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom ordered bars to close in seven of the state 's counties but San Diego was not on that list . 
" San Diego County was not included in the action taken by the state but we believe it is appropriate , " Fletcher said . 
" We believe it is wise for us to take this action now given the increases we 've seen in cases and percentage of positive cases and outbreaks . "
