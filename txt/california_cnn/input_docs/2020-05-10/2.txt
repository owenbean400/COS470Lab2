White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett said a new emergency relief bill that would provide funding to state and local governments might not be passed right away . 
He said the White House wants to learn more about what is going on in the economy as money from previous relief bills is still being distributed . 
But he said that while a phase four deal might be on the back burner for now , President Trump would sign the right package . 
" Of course if we go to a phase four deal , I think President Trump has signaled that while he does not want to bail out the states , he 's willing to help cover some of the unexpected Covid expenses that might have come their way , " Hassett said . 
Some context : Capitol Hill has passed nearly $ 3 trillion in funding across several packages in response to the coronavirus already , including $ 150 billion for state and local governments . 
The problem is because there are specific guidelines on what this money has to be used for , local governments ca not use it for things they need most , like basic operational costs , such as paying police and firefighters , for example . 
Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have suggested that state and local governments could need as much as an additional $ 1 trillion in aid , but Republicans are wary about passing another huge relief bill . 
Trump said on Friday that the White House is " in no rush " to pass additional stimulus funds in response to coronavirus .
