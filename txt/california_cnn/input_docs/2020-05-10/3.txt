This Mother 's Day feels very different than most as people across the world cope with the coronavirus pandemic . 
That means many people are not able to see their mom in person or hug them . 
They are keeping their mom safe by staying home or coming up with creative and virtual ways to celebrate the women in their lives . 
President Barack Obama wished Michelle happy Mother 's Day with a tweet that said , " Even if you ca not give the moms in your life a hug today , I hope you can give them an extra thank you today . "
