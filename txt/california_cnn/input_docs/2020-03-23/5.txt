The hotel industry expects 44 % of all US hotel employees could lose their jobs as the coronavirus outbreak drys up demand . 
The American Hotel and Lodging Association says in a new study that the drastic decline in occupancy is causing hotel owners to implement " massive , unavoidable layoffs and furloughs , " and believes it will only get worse . 
" The impact to our industry is already more severe than anything we â€™ve seen before , including September 11th and the great recession of 2008 combined , " said Chip Rogers , President and CEO of the trade group . 
The hotel industry directly employees or supports more than 8 million jobs in the US . 
The group estimates that more than 4 million have been lost already , or will be eliminated in the next few weeks . 
The states expecting the biggest losses are California , Florida , Nevada and New York . 
The American Hotel and Lodging Association represents companies across the hotel industry , including Marriott International , Hyatt , Hilton Hotels and Resorts , and Disney Parks , Experiences and Products . 
Marriott International , the world 's largest hotel chain , announced last week it had begun furloughing some of its 130,000 employees .
