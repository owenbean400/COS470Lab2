The Grand Princess cruise ship , with at least 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus onboard , will dock in the Port of Oakland on Monday , according to a tweet from the Princess Cruises . 
The ship has been waiting to learn its fate while remaining 50 miles off the coast of San Francisco due to concerns over the coronavirus . 
In the message , the company says it will begin disembarking guests who require acute medical treatment and hospitalization at this time . 
Those guests will be transported to medical facilities in California , but the exact timing for when this will happen is still being determined .
