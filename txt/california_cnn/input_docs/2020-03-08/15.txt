The US federal government chose the Port of Oakland in California as the disembarkation location for the Grand Princess cruise ship , Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced in a press conference Sunday . 
Oakland was chosen for several logistical reasons , said state Gov . 
Gavin Newsom . 
Its proximity to Oakland Airport will allow foreign passengers from the cruise to be repatriated to their home countries through chartered flights . 
These passengers will have no contact with the general population in the airport terminals , Newsom said . 
The chartered flights , processed with the US State Department , will be completely separate . 
Oakland is close to Travis Air Force Base , where California residents from the cruise ship will be quarantined for 14 days . 
The base is roughly 50 miles north of the port . 
Mayor Schaaf said the community of Oakland will be safe and constantly informed about the operation . 
She added that she has addressed state and federal partners about the context of the Oakland community , which has suffered " decades of environment racism and injustice . " 
Nobody will be quarantined in Oakland , she said . 
The site is currently being secured . 
The cruise ship is anticipated to dock sometime Monday and the operation is expected to last two to three days , according to Newsom .
