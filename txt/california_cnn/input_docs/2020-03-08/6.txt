Princess Cruises has cancelled its Royal Princess cruise out of Los Angeles , after the CDC issued a " no sail order " until one of the ship â€™s crew members has been tested for Novel Coronavirus , according to a Tweet from Princess Cruises . 
According to the cruise line , one of the crew members , who previously served on Grand Princess , was transferred to Royal Princess 15 days ago . More than 3,500 people aboard the Grand Princess have been stuck on that cruise ship for days , after their two week journey was interrupted on its return leg Wednesday , when officials learned that a California man who 'd traveled on that ship last month contracted coronavirus and died this week . 
After Princess Cruises shared the information about the transferred crew member with the CDC , the CDC initially approved clearance for the Royal Princess to sail on Saturday , with no restrictions placed on the vessel . 
However , late Saturday afternoon , the CDC informed the cruise line of their decision to issue a " no sail order " until the crew member was tested for Novel Coronavirus , Princess Cruises said . 
According to the cruise line , they were unable to obtain a test for the crew member , and " due to the unknown timing of obtaining the test and results or anticipated response , " the cruise was cancelled . 
Princess Cruises says the crew member , who had no known contact or exposure to other guests or crew who were sick on the Grand Princess , is past the maximum incubation of Novel Coronavirus , has been evaluated , and has never developed any respiratory symptoms or fever .
