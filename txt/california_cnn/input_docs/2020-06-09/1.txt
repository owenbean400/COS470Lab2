Orange County Health Officer Dr . Nichole Quick resigned from her position amid threats to her personal safety after she issued an order requiring face coverings in the county . 
After the order , Quick was threatened during a county board meeting and received threats on social media , according to County Executive Frank Kim . 
Quick was not alone . 
A number of personal threats were made to county staff since the beginning of the pandemic , Kim said , but he would not go so far as to say threats were the sole reason for Quick ’s departure . 
Kim said he was caught off guard by Quick ’s resignation . 
" It was a surprise to me , " he said . 
" I am very disappointed that she left . 
There was no encouragement from myself or any other board members for her to resign . " 
He said he understood that the title of health officer " is a very stressful position . " 
Everyone in the health department has been working massive overtime , upwards of 80 hour weeks since February , he said . 
Quick is the third high profile member to leave the department since the coronavirus pandemic began .
