Four hospitals in California received a total of 33,150 Covid 19 vaccine doses today , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom announced , just minutes after some of the first health care workers in the state were vaccinated at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center . 
Strikingly , the number of doses received in the state were equal to the number of new infections recorded today . 
Today â€™s shipments were sent to hospitals in Los Angeles , San Diego and Northern California . 
On Tuesday , 24 additional sites are expected to receive vaccine shipments , and five more sites will receive the doses on Wednesday , Newsom elaborated . 
" We are very close within the next week or so anticipating that to be replicated in other parts of this state , " Newsom said . 
" We are in the midst of the worst moment of this pandemic so today is hopeful and reason to be optimistic , but let 's be mindful of where we really are , in terms of this pandemic and forgive me for saying that . " 
Both Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti expressed awe at the moment the scientific milestone brings . 
" The hope of this moment to witness the vaccines that we just saw , brought a tear to my eye , because it shows human ingenuity . 
It shows the stubbornness , that human beings have , we want to survive . 
We want to thrive . 
And we will make it through this , " Garcetti gushed . 
Newsom plans to be vaccinated , but said he will wait until it is available to him , " I will not be cutting in line " in front of critical workers , he said . 
Garcetti also intends to get vaccinated when appropriate , and assured residents of the safety of the vaccine . 
" I just also wanted to spell out for any communities , because at the federal level , and with a double check at the state , these vaccines have not been infected by power . 
You can trust them . 
You should trust them . 
I trust them . "
