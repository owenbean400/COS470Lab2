California ’s sweeping new coronavirus reopening system takes a slower , more cautious approach to allowing businesses and activities to resume after Gov . 
Gavin Newsom faced criticism for allowing counties to quickly reopen in the spring , leading to a dramatic rise in infections and deaths . 
The governor previously faced criticism for allowing counties to reopen businesses too quickly before meeting key metrics required by the state . 
As California saw a resurgence in coronavirus cases in June , Newsom began shutting down much of the economy again , placing the majority of the state ’s 58 counties on a state " monitoring list " that forced the closure of many indoor businesses and activities . 
In recent weeks , the state has seen its average number of new daily confirmed cases fall by more than 3,000 from its July peak as well as a falling hospitalization and death toll . 
Under the state ’s new reopening rules unveiled Friday , counties must wait a minimum of 21 days before they can move to a less restrictive tier . 
In order to ease restrictions further , counties will need to meet reopening metrics for two straight weeks . 
A failure to meet those targets may require counties to return to a more restrictive tier , Newsom warned . 
The new system , the governor said , is " simple " but also " slow , " with the vast majority of the state ’s population beginning the new framework under the first tier , requiring most nonessential businesses and schools to remain closed . 
On Friday , the state reported 140 additional deaths , raising the statewide total since the start of the pandemic to 12,690 . 
It also reported 5,329 new confirmed cases for a total of 688,858 .
