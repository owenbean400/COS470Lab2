Pandemic related losses to California farms , ranches and agricultural businesses will range between $ 5.9 billion and $ 8.6 billion this year , the California Farm Bureau Federation ( CFBF ) said in a statement Tuesday . 
The CFBF , which represents family farms and ranches on behalf of nearly 34,000 members statewide , said California 's agricultural sector has already suffered over $ 2 billion in losses this year from large shifts in retail demand and rising production costs . 
" California farmers , ranchers and their employees have continued the essential work needed to keep American families fed , but that work has come with sacrifice , " CFBF President Jamie Johansson said . 
" The impact is being felt in rural communities throughout the state that rely on agriculture for their residents â€™ livelihoods . " 
Farms , ranches and agricultural businesses have also incurred higher operating costs for measures intended to increase employee health and safety , and in the more complex logistics required to move crops and commodities to market during the pandemic . 
Many California farmers will never be able to recoup these operational costs , the CFBF said . 
While many California farmers say their live crop businesses may not survive the pandemic , shelf items like rice , processed tomato products and canned fruit have seen an increase in demand , according to data from the study . 
But in aggregate , " the losses far outweigh the isolated benefits , " the CFBF said .
