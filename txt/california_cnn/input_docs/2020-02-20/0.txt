John Haering and his wife Melanie were on a six month world trip . 
He ’d just retired . 
But shortly after the Diamond Princess quarantine began , John ’s temperature spiked , and he was taken off the ship and into isolation in a local hospital . 
Now , the couple are thousands of miles apart . 
Melanie is not sick , but she ’s in quarantine -- on a California military base -- one of several hundred Americans evacuated Monday on charter flights . 
" There ’s a strange feeling of loneliness that you ’re by yourself , that there ’s nobody else here to take care of you , " John told CNN . 
Japan says its decision to quarantine the ship was the best option . 
But the US Centers for Disease Control says people on board that ship during quarantine were of higher risk to catch the virus -- but the US did not evacuate its people for nearly two weeks after it began . 
Both John and Melanie are grateful the flights happened . 
John only wishes they ’d done it sooner . 
" If that were the case , I would be sitting in a U.S . facility with U.S . doctors . 
My wife would be there and I would get the best care that I possibly get on my home soil , " he said .
