The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to share its test for Wuhan coronavirus with other labs in the United States — but for now , it remains the only US lab that can confirm cases of the virus . 
For now , CDC is continuing to ask lab partners to send samples to the agency for testing because it ’s more efficient and ensures results are as accurate as possible , officials said . 
What is the test ? 
The test developed by CDC can diagnose the novel coronavirus in respiratory serum samples . 
The CDC has posted a " blueprint " to make the test , and said the agency is " refining " this use of the test so it can provide optimal guidance to states and labs on how to use it . 
Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said CDC is working " as fast as we can , " but added " but it ’s [ going to be ] another week or two . " 
Where has coronavirus spread in the US ? 
CDC has confirmed five US cases of the coronavirus in four states – Arizona , California , Illinois and Washington – and has 73 cases under investigation with results still pending .
