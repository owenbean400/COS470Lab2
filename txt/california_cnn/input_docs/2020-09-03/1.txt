The lawyer representing cosmetologist Jonathan De Nardo , who provided hair services to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , released a statement saying he received advanced approval from Erica Kious , the salon owner , the day before the appointment . 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got her hair styled Monday inside a San Francisco hair salon , her office said in a statement Tuesday , an apparent violation of the city 's Covid 19 safety regulations that enraged the salon 's owner . 
Fox News reported that the owner of the salon , Erica Kious , was angry that Pelosi had broken the rules requiring such hair treatments to be done outdoors because of the pandemic . 
Pelosi said Wednesday that she takes " responsibility for falling for a setup . " 
" I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighborhood salon that I 've been to over the years , many times , and that when they said we 're able to accommodate people , one person at a time , and that we can set up that time , I trusted that . 
As it turns out , it was a setup . 
So I take responsibility for falling for a setup , " the California Democrat said during a question and answer portion of an event in San Francisco .
