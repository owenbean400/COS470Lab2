Things were looking up for Jason Zenga in late 2019 and in early 2020 . 
The personal trainer worked out of a gym based in Santa Monica , California , where he taught classes twice a week . 
He also worked as an independent corporate trainer through a partnership with his friend , where they 'd go to offices and train employees at companies across Los Angeles . 
But business began to dry up in March , as local and federal governments began implementing stricter policies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus . 
All of a sudden , the gym that employed Zenga closed . 
There were no offices to go to train employees at , and Zenga could only train the last few of his clients virtually . 
He had to apply for unemployment benefits . 
" All the uncertainty was frustrating , " Zenga told CNN . 
Meanwhile , across the country , Atlanta based trainer Bria Young found her business booming during the pandemic . 
When gyms began to close , Young transitioned to packaging workouts into online digital programs on her website , and began selling them . 
" It completely flip flopped , I did not even need to go back to in person training , " Young told CNN . 
" I was able to find a new passion during this pandemic . " 
There 's no question that the fitness industry has been upended by the pandemic -- and for some trainers like Zenga , the last 10 months have proved to be financially devastating . 
For others , like Young , the pandemic has turned into a fruitful opportunity to pivot to virtual full time .
