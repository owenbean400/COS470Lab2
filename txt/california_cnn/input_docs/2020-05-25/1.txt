The workers union representing 1,300 employees of Smithfield â€™s Farmer John plant just south of Los Angeles , California , are calling for its immediate closure in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak . 
The company , which makes the Dodger Dog , a delicacy at baseball games , reported 153 cases among its 1,837 employees , according to the L.A . County Department of Public Health . 
Of the 153 , only 14 have returned to work . 
Smithfield has offered testing to all employees . 
The union said the company needs to increase safety measures before reopening . 
Rina Chavarria , who works at the plant , said in the statement that workers do not feel safe . 
" We work hard every day . 
Smithfield has not taken steps to make sure workers are protected and now so many of us are getting sick . 
We ca not go to the plant under these conditions . 
We are paid too little not to work so we call on Smithfield to do the right thing and close the plant while we keep our pay and benefits , " Chavarria said . 
Some context : President Trump signed an executive order at the end of April aimed at keeping meat processing facilities open during the pandemic . 
This left plants across the country scrambling to balance worker safety with pressure from the federal government to remain operational .
