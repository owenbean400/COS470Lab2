California issued guidelines on Monday that would allow places of worship to open , while still " strongly recommending " institutions hold remote services for vulnerable populations including older adults . 
Here are some of the suggestions included in the guidance : Religious leaders are asked to " strongly consider " discontinuing singing and group recitation where transmission of the virus through exhaled droplets is increased . 
Sharing items like prayer books , prayer rugs , and hymn books are discouraged and single use or digital copies are suggested as alternatives . 
Potlucks should be discontinued and communion is suggested to be modified by offering in the hand rather than on the tongue . 
Attendance should be held to 25 % of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees , whichever is lower . 
Holding services outside is encouraged . 
Pews and other seating should be reconfigured to keep six feet of physical distance between households . 
Shorter services and implementation of a reservation system to limit the number of attendees at one time are suggested . 
Despite the guidelines , the state cautions that " even with adherence to physical distancing , convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of COVID 19 . "
