The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom 's ban on in person church services in a ruling issued Friday in a lawsuit filed by a church in Chula Vista . 
South Bay United Pentecostal Church filed for a temporary injunction and sued the governor along with several other state officers on May 8 following Newsom 's May 4 announcement that stage two of the state 's reopening plan would commence within a week , according to the ruling . 
The state of California is currently in stage two of its four phase reopening plan . 
Churches would be allowed to reopen in stage three of the plan as they are a " higher risk workplace , " the ruling noted . 
A district court denied the request for a temporary injunction on May 15 , according to the ruling .
