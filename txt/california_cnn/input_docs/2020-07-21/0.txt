California appeared to be moving in the right direction when it came to Covid 19 . 
It was the first state to impose a stay at home order on March 19 . 
Less than two months later , on May 8 , the numbers had fallen enough that the state started the first phase of reopening . 
California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom told his citizens , " You have bent the curve . " 
But then Memorial Day came around . 
By early June the numbers started creeping back up . 
The seven day average for daily coronavirus cases totaled more than 2,600 . 
Then they skyrocketed . 
By July 11 , the seven day average had risen to 9,400 new cases of coronavirus per day , a more than 250 % increase . 
The numbers fluctuate daily but the trend shows California is in surge . 
By July 13 , Newsom ordered the shutdown of bars , indoor dining , movie theaters , wineries and some other businesses across the state again . 
So what went wrong ? 
Anne Rimoin , an epidemiology professor at the University of California Los Angeles , says the answer is simple .
