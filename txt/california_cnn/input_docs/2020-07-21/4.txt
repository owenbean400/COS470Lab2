High levels of transmission of coronavirus have made traditional tracing " impractical and difficult to do , " California Health Secretary Mark Ghaly said in streamed update on the virus . 
The state is working to refine strategies and continue to work with counties to build up the so called " tracing army , " but Ghaly warns that " even a very robust contact tracing program will have a hard time reaching out to every single case . " 
Ghaly said the data is continuing to stabilize and as that happens , he expects to see transmission rates to come down and contact tracing to go up . 
Addressing the rise in cases , which have passed 400,000 confirmed to date , Ghaly said that California has been able to avoid a large spike that other states and nations saw early . 
" As a result , we ’ve been able to limit not just the number of those with the worst outcomes , but even improve the clinical outcomes of those who ’ve been hospitalized altogether , " Ghaly said , adding that the state has used the time to build up an inventory of supplies and hospital capacity .
