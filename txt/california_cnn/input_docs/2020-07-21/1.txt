Karma Quick Panwala , who describes herself as severely hard of hearing , relies on lip reading to communicate . 
She was midway through her pregnancy when the Covid 19 crisis began , and became concerned she would not be able to communicate with doctors and nurses when they were wearing protective masks . 
" I like to say lip reading is my superpower and masks are my kryptonite , " said Quick Panwala . 
" I 'm completely cut off from communication unless I have someone come speak to me personally so that I can lip read to understand what 's being said . 
I knew right away I was going to need some form of communication access . " 
That 's where Isabella Appell , 17 , comes in . 
The high school junior from Thousand Oaks , California , has been making face masks since the coronavirus pandemic began . 
Appell is not hard of hearing , but said she has always been interested in learning sign language and is part of several Facebook groups for deaf people . 
" I noticed that there were a lot of comments about how scary it was for them right now and how hard it was for them to communicate , " said Appell . 
" I started researching on how I could accommodate these masks for everybody . " 
Appell created Talking Masks , a small venture that makes masks featuring a clear plastic window . 
She cuts the fabric from a template she created , then sews the masks and inserts a piece of clear plastic vinyl over the mouth . 
She applies a de fogging spray to the final product , so it does not steam up when in use .
