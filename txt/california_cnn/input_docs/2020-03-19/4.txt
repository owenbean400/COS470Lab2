Ventura County is ordering residents ages 70 and older to shelter in place until at least April 1 , joining other regions of California attempting to stem the spread of coronavirus . 
The order adds : " Exceptions shall only exist as necessary to seek medical care , nutrition , or to perform essential work in healthcare or government . " 
Violation of this order is a misdemeanor and could result in a fine or imprisonment . 
" We have no plans on arresting 75 year olds , " said Ashley Bautista , a Ventura County spokesperson . 
However , the cost for violation is to illustrate how serious coronavirus is to the community . 
By the numbers : Ventura County has 13 cases of coronavirus . 
The state of California has 834 cases , including 17 deaths .
