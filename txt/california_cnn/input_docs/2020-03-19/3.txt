The average price of a gallon of gas has fallen below $ 2 in nearly a quarter of the country 's states , according to AAA . 
The national average currently stands at $ 2.19 for a gallon of regular gas , the lowest it 's been since early December 2016 . 
That 's down 13 cents from a week ago and 36 cents lower than a year ago . Oklahoma is the cheapest , with a cost per gallon of regular going for $ 1.84 . Hawaii and California are the two most expensive states for a gallon of regular , at $ 3.52 and $ 3.28 respectively . 
" This is unprecedented , " Tom Kloza , head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service , told CNN Business . 
Kloza expects that the national average will soon drop between $ 1.99 per gallon with some states hitting $ 1 per gallon or less . 
The national average price will probably decline further ‐ perhaps to between $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 per gallon — in the next few months , he said .
