A 57 year old man from El Salvador became the first person to die from coronavirus while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody , a senior immigration official said on Wednesday . 
The man had been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego , California , the official said . 
Reports of the man 's death drew swift condemnation from immigrant rights organizations , who 've been pushing for weeks for ICE to release more detainees from its facilities and arguing coronavirus poses a deadly threat to immigrants behind bars . 
It 's been six weeks since ICE announced the first detainee in its custody had tested positive for the novel coronavirus . 
According to the latest statistics published on the agency 's website , 674 detainees in ICE custody have tested positive for the virus out of a total of 1,346 detainees tested .
