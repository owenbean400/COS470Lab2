California will be refunded $ 247 million it paid to a Chinese firm to deliver 200 million N95 respirator masks under a secretive contract which was not disclosed to the public until Wednesday . 
After weeks of questions and pressure , the state disclosed the refund and released the contract worth nearly $ 1 billion with BYD , a Chinese automaker with offices in downtown Los Angeles . 
The contract , which included an upfront payment of $ 495 million , called for the production of 500 million face masks over a two and a half month period . 
At a news conference Wednesday , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom told reporters the state had received 15 million surgical masks from the company , but was still waiting on tens of millions of N95 respirator masks that were expected to arrive in California this week but had failed to meet a delivery deadline . 
The contract between California and BYD requires the Chinese manufacturer to certify the effectiveness of its N95 masks with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) . 
It was unclear what caused the certification delay . 
As recently as mid April , Newsom said the delivery of masks from BYD would be on time and that , in fact , the state and federal government were auditing BYD factories in China . 
It is not known whether the masks have been delivered to the United States and are currently subject to inspection in the country .
