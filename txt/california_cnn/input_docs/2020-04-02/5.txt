Job loss in California is climbing rapidly and stands at 1.9 million unemployment claims , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said in a news conference today . 
Over the past week , claims have been coming in at a rate of about 111,000 per day , Newsom said . . 
Unemployment checks usually take about three weeks to turn around in California . 
Through reorganization , about 1,000 workers are being brought in to administer the claims surge . 
Providing more support : The governor outlined a few of new programs for small businesses and independent contractors . 
The first is a one year reprieve on sales tax payments , a bridge loan with no penalties or interest . 
Another program – the Paycheck Protection Program – starts Friday and will lend up to $ 10 million to small companies in order to pay their employees . 
Those loans will be eligible for a federal repayment grant , but at least 75 % of the money must be used for payroll . 
Additionally , the governor said $ 50 million is being added to the state ’s infrastructure bank for micro loans – those would be payable to people not eligible for small business loans . 
Newsom also noted a partnership between Fresno company Bitwise and Silicon Valley giants Linked In and Sales Force . 
That group has created onwardca.org , a website that matches unemployed workers with open jobs . 
It is specifically focused on healthcare , agriculture , logistics and grocers .
