People leaving their homes for essential activities in California are not required to wear surgical masks , according to new guidance by the state 's Department of Public Health . 
The department also said that wearing a cloth face covering could provide some protection from the spread of the novel coronavirus . 
LA mayor asks residents to consider health workers : The official advice comes after Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti announced that residents should wear non medical grade face masks or coverings when in public to save essential personal protective equipment for frontline medical workers . 
" Please do not get medical grade or surgical masks , or N95 masks . 
We must not contribute to the shortage of these essential personal protective equipment for medial personnel and first responders , " he said .
