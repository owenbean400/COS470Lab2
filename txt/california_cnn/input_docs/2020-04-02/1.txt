As the number of novel coronavirus cases in California approaches 10,000 , doctors at a Los Angeles hospital say they are seeing an increase in patients showing Covid 19 symptoms , causing a reduction in capacity and the rationing of protective equipment for medical workers . 
Franklin , who works at Centinela Hospital Medical Center and two smaller hospitals in the area , said that while fewer people are showing up at the emergency department seeking treatment , more are showing coronavirus like symptoms and being admitted . 
Centinela Hospital , a private institution which treats more than 60,000 patients a year in its emergency room , has set up two Covid 19 curbside tents outside its ER as it prepares for the outbreak to intensify as it has in New York . 
About 80 % of the ventilators at Centinela Hospital are now in use by patients , one hospital administrator said , and their supply is low . 
All of this increased need for hospital care is also impacting personal protection equipment supplies throughout Los Angeles County . 
" We do not have enough PPE . 
They often have to be rationed out , " Franklin said , noting that some hospitals will lock up the equipment in a drawer or cabinet .
