The Pentagon expects to receive a request from the Department of Health and Human Services as early as today for additional housing capacity for people arriving in the United States aboard charter planes arranged by the US government . 
They 're being placed into quarantine to ensure they do not have coronavirus , according to a US official directly familiar with the latest developments . 
The housing would be for US government personnel , contractors and dependents arriving in the US under the State Department â€™s order to not travel to China . 
Nearly 200 people are already being quarantined at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County , California . 
But that facility is now considered at capacity . 
The Trump Administration is quietly looking at other military bases and facilities that could be used to quarantine people expected to continue arriving in the US through the weekend . 
At this point , the effort would not extend to Americans returning from China aboard commercial aircraft , only those returning on flights such as the one arranged by the State Department earlier this week that landed at March Air Reserve Base in California .
