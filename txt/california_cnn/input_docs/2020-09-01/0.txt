California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom signed a bill early Tuesday morning that would protect tenants from eviction and property owners from foreclosure due to the economic impacts of Covid 19 . 
Newsom said the pandemic had impacted everyone in California , but tenants struggling to pay monthly rent had been especially affected and deserved protection from eviction . 
" This new law protects tenants from eviction for non payment of rent and helps keep homeowners out of foreclosure as a result of economic hardship caused by this terrible pandemic , " he said . 
The governor also called for federal funding to help homeowners and tenants hurt by the financial impact of coronavirus . 
" California is stepping up to protect those most at risk because of COVID related nonpayment , but it â€™s just a bridge to a more permanent solution once the federal government finally recognizes its role in stabilizing the housing market , " he said . 
" We need a real , federal commitment of significant new funding to assist struggling tenants and homeowners in California and across the nation . "
