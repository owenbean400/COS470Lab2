More than a dozen people who attended a large family party in Northern California later tested positive for the coronavirus , a private gathering that state officials say is just one of many contributing to the record surge in new Covid 19 infections . 
The party , which took place earlier this month in Shasta County , near the Oregon border , resulted in 13 family members becoming infected with the virus . 
In the days following the party , a man in his 20s tested positive on June 14 , followed by 11 more people on June 19 and one more on June 21 , according to the Shasta County Health and Human Services Agency . 
Health officials had advised 20 people to self quarantine after the party . 
A majority of the 13 family members who tested positive for the virus were experiencing symptoms , the health agency said , and ranged in age from a teenage girl to a woman in her 60s . 
The party is just one of several that has resulted in attendees later testing positive for the virus . 
At another recent gathering in the county , a graduation party , at least four of the 11 people who attended later tested positive for Covid 19 , said Shasta County Health Officer Dr . Karen Ramstrom . 
The spread of the illness among family members and friends comes as California sees an increase in the percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus , and a record number of patients being treated in hospitals and intensive care units .
