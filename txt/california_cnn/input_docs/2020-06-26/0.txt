Barbara Ferrer , the director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health , said people need to start working together to contain the spread of coronavirus as cases spike in California and several other states across the country . 
" Obviously when your numbers start going in the wrong direction , it means that more people need to do the right thing . 
More people need to get back on track . 
They need to take the steps that protect each other , " she told CNN on Thursday . 
Ferrer said that means people need to continue to wear face coverings , practice social distancing and avoid large crowds â€“ as well as rely and follow information and guidance from public health officials and scientists . 
Some context : California obliterated its previous single day high with 7,149 cases reported on Tuesday , according to state Department of Public Health . 
The previous record , set the day before , was just more than 5,000 . 
Hospitalization and intensive care rates due to the virus are also at an all time high in the state . 
" I think as we had anticipated with more people out , we would have seen the increase . 
I think the increase has happened much quicker than we thought it would , " Ferrer said .
