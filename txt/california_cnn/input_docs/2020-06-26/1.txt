Disneyland employee unions are planning a protest on Saturday against the reopening of the Southern California theme park , which announced its decision to postpone the July 17 reopening date . 
The Coalition of Resort Labor Unions ( CRLU ) , which represents approximately 17,000 service workers from dozens of unions of the Disneyland resort , is hosting an event called " Disney Caravan For Safety ! " on Saturday in front of the park in Anaheim , California . 
Last week , CRLU sent a letter to California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom asking to delay the reopening of the park due to safety concerns . 
On Wednesday , Disney said they are delaying the phased reopening of Disneyland and Disney California Adventure but did not announce a new reopening date . 
In addition to routine testing , CRLU is also demanding higher staffing levels to accommodate deep cleaning requirements .
