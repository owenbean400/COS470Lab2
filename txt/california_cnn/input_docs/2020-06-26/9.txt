People commingling during recent racial justice protests are believed to be a contributing factor to the rise in coronavirus cases in California , according to Dr . Sonia Angell , the state 's health director . 
Angell stressed that with community spread , health officials may not be able to distinguish exactly where someone may have been exposed . 
" It ’s highly likely given the increased numbers that we ’re seeing , that some of this is in fact people who may have been in a crowded situation at one of the protests where there was spread , " Los Angeles Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week . 
Sacramento County reported at least three individual cases that are apparently linked to recent demonstrations , according to California Department of Public Health .
