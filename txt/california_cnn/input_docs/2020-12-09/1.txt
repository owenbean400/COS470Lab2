After registering a record number of new coronavirus cases in the state of California in one week , residents of Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley received a text on Tuesday asking them to stay home and abide by newly enacted health orders , according to a tweet from California Governor 's Office of Emergency Services . 
The California text message comes as the state is reporting alarming coronavirus numbers . 
The state reported 169,354 new cases over the past seven days , which is the highest any state has reported over the course of the pandemic . 
Over the last two weeks , daily case counts in the state have more than doubled . 
California also reached a grim milestone Tuesday when it recorded more than 20,000 deaths . 
In the past two weeks , hospitalizations rose by 71 % and ICU admissions saw a 68.7 % increase , California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly said at a news conference Tuesday . 
Ghaly expressed concern that with the strain , highly trained health care workers will " not be able to provide the kind of care Californians have come to expect . " 
Both Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley found themselves under the new health orders Sunday night as ICU capacity in each fell under the 15 % threshold set by Gov . 
Gavin Newsom . 
California is not the first state to use cellphones to warn residents about coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic â€” in April , New York City sent an emergency alert to phones asking all licensed health workers to support its health facilities . 
And in October , officials in Utah sent an emergency alert to every phone in the state to warn about rapidly rising cases .
