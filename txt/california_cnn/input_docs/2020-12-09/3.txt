At least three California counties in one of the regions in a stay at home order has 0 % intensive care unit capacity available , according to data from the state department of public health . 
" Whenever the ICUs get full , it ’s really hard to move patients through the emergency department . 
It ’s really hard for us to provide efficient services , " Dr . Rais Vohra said , an emergency physician who serves as the interim public health officer for Fresno County . 
Vohra emphasized how dire the situation is , adding that working on the frontlines " gives you a very eye opening perspective . " 
Vohra warned that 10-15 % of all infected cases will need to visit an emergency department and some will require hospitalization and therefore will be a strain on services at hospitals for all patients , including those not battling Covid 19 . 
According to information from the California Department of Public Health : Fresno has nine available ICU beds . 
Kings County has zero ICU beds available . 
Madera county has one bed available . 
The counties are part of the San Joaquin Valley Region which is under a three week state mandated stay home order triggered last weekend by the low number of ICU beds available . 
CNN has reached out to the health departments in Kings and Madera counties for comment .
