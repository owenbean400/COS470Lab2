California broke Covid 19 records Wednesday as it recorded its highest number of cases in a single day and increased hospitalizations and intensive care admissions . 
The state added 30,851 new confirmed cases Wednesday , about 800 more than the previous record set Sunday . 
The steep climb in infections brings California ’s total to more than 1.4 million cases , according to data from California Department of Public Health . 
Hospitalizations are at an all time high with nearly 12,000 people receiving in patient treatment . 
More than 2,600 of those patients have been admitted to intensive care units – another record number . 
Available ICU beds in all of California have also dipped , according to state data . 
Several hospitals in the San Joaquin Valley have completely run out of ICU beds as has San Jose Regional Medical Center in the Bay Area . 
That limited capacity of ICU beds has triggered regional stay at home orders affecting about 27 million residents in Central and Southern California .
