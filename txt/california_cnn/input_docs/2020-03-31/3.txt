Gun stores in Los Angeles will be allowed to open after days of back and forth over whether they are an essential service . 
California is subject to a state wide stay at home order , meaning only essential services can remain open . 
The order also applies to Los Angeles , the largest city in the state . 
The problem is , not everyone agrees about what counts as an essential service . 
How the saga unfolded : On Tuesday , March 24 , Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said gun stores had been declared a nonessential business and had been forced to close . 
Villanueva said he was adding 1,300 deputies to help enforce closures . 
The next day , he withdrew his order . 
Later in the week , Villanueva reiterated that gun and ammunition stores are not essential businesses and must close , capping a few days of back and forth about the fate of stores in the county . 
Then on Friday , the National Rifle Association and other gun owner groups filed a lawsuit against California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom and other state and county officials . 
Now , Villanueva has backtracked again , saying gun stores will no longer be closed .
