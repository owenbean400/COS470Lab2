Los Angeles County public health officials on Thursday reported more new Covid 19 cases than on any single day since late August , when the region last saw a dramatic surge in infections . 
Public health officials reported 1,745 new cases of Covid 19 on Thursday and 19 additional deaths , for a total of 305,070 positive cases and 7,044 deaths in the county since the start of the pandemic . 
The increase was not associated with a backlog of data . 
Some context : The rise in new confirmed cases came as public health officials expressed growing alarm over a recent increase in infections , some of which can be attributed to fans gathering for parties and events to watch the city ’s MLB and NBA teams win championship titles . 
" The high numbers of daily cases are very concerning because , as we have seen in the past , increases in cases lead to increases in hospitalizations and deaths , " Dr . Barbara Ferrer , the Los Angeles County director of public health , said in a statement Thursday . 
" As individuals , we get to choose whether to party or help our economy recover ; we get to choose whether to protect others from our respiratory droplets or infect others who may go on to need hospital care or even die . " 
Los Angeles County , the nation ’s most populous with 10 million residents , remains in the first of California ’s four tier coronavirus reopening system , where the disease is considered " widespread , " forcing the closure of most nonessential indoor business operations .
