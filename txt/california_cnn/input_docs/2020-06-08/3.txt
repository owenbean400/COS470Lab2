A genetic study suggests the new coronavirus was carried into California several times by travelers , and suggests the state missed several opportunities to use contact tracing to stop further spread . 
The report , published in the journal Science , also strongly indicates that at least one large cruise ship outbreak started with a virus transmitted by a single person infected with a strain of the virus that spread in Washington state early in the pandemic . 
It ’s a small analysis , but helps paint a picture of how a few cases can turn into a pandemic — and how quick action can stop the spread , said Dr . Charles Chiu , a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California , San Francisco , who led the study team . 
For instance , the outbreak that infected more than 700 people with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February of this year , killing nine of them , almost certainly started with a single case , Chiu said . 
" Probably one passenger brought it on board , " Chiu told CNN . 
The strain that infected the passengers and crew on two voyages of the liner was the same strain that circulated widely in Washington state and elsewhere , Chiu added . 
In contrast , another outbreak stopped with three people . 
One patient in Solano County infected two health care workers who cared for her , and transmission stopped there . 
" That was it . 
It was an outbreak of three individuals , " Chiu said . 
In that case , contact tracing and quick isolation of the new cases stopped any further spread , the researchers said . 
The findings , he said , show many missed opportunities to stop the virus when it was seeded multiple times into California . 
" We simply did not have the infrastructure to do the detecting that would have been needed , " Chiu said . 
The findings also show that travel restrictions can work if they are started early enough and observed carefully .
