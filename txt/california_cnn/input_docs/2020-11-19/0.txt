California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom is enacting a curfew as part of a " limited stay at home order " that will affect about 94 % of the state ’s population . 
The order requires those in California ’s most restrictive of four tiers to stay home between 10 p.m . and 5 a.m . local time . 
The month long order takes effect Saturday night and is essentially the same as the stay at home order issued in March , but applies only during those specific hours to residents in " purple tier " counties , according to a news release sent by Newsom ’s office . 
The reason for the specific hours noted that activities conducted during this time that are often nonessential and more likely related to social activities and gatherings that have a higher likelihood of leading to reduced inhibition , the governor 's office said .
