The Los Angeles Unified School District in California will " not begin with students at school facilities , " LAUSD Superintendent Austin Beutner said this morning . 
LAUSD is the second largest district in the nation and serves over 600,000 students in grades K 12 . 
The San Diego Unified School District , in coordination with LAUSD , will also start the school year online only . 
K 12 students at SDUSD will return to school , though not in person , on August 31 . 
" Both districts will continue planning for a return to in person learning during the 2020-21 academic year , as soon as public health conditions allow , " according to the joint statement . 
SDUSD is the second largest district in the state . 
Some background : On Friday , United Teachers of Los Angeles ( UTLA ) , the union representing teachers , said 83 % of 18,000 members polled said schools should not physically reopen on August 18 , the first day of school for LAUSD . 
LAUSD and UTLA have another bargaining session this week .
