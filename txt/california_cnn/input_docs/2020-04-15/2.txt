California ’s undocumented workers who have been forced out of work as a result of the pandemic will be eligible for payments in a new private public partnership announced by Gov . 
Gavin Newsom . 
The workers are not eligible for federal stimulus payments . 
Undocumented workers make up about 10 % of California ’s workforce , Newsom said . 
Because these workers pay approximately $ 2.5 billion in state and local taxes , Newsom has signed a Direct Disaster Assistance order , which will provide up to $ 500 for individuals and up to $ 1,000 for families . 
The state will provide $ 75 million to fund the program and private philanthropists will give $ 50 million . 
Some philanthropic foundations that have signed on to donate include the Emerson Collective , the Zuckerberg Chan Foundation , the James Irvine Foundation , and Blue Shield Foundation .
