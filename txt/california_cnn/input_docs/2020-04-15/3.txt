Dairy farmers in California are now being forced to dump milk due to an enormous decrease in demand with schools and restaurants remaining closed during the statewide stay at home order . 
As the shelter in place orders increased throughout the month of March and restaurants were forced to close , 50 % of the customer base was eliminated almost overnight , according to Western United Dairies CEO Anja Raudabaugh , who represents over 860 dairy farm families in California . 
Restaurant chains like TGI Friday ’s and Applebee ’s are huge customers of the dairy industry , but they stopped placing orders in the middle of March , Raudabaugh said . 
The demand also significantly decreased with school closures and the lunch programs shutting down . 
While schools are still delivering drive through meals , the demand is not even close to what it was , Raudabaugh said . 
California dairy farmers saw the biggest impact from these two sectors and it caused a tremendous amount of distribution challenges . 
Plants are now running at about 150 % of their capacity , according to Raudabaugh .
