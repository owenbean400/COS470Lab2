Dr . Anthony Fauci said he spoke with California health authorities and told them the new restrictions in the state make sense to him . 
He added that when hospitals become overwhelmed , that 's when you could start seeing lockdowns . 
" When you reach a certain critical point of the flexibility of hospital beds , and you see more cases of Covid coming in , you could have a real challenge – and maybe even a crisis – with regard to beds and personnel to take care of the people in those beds . 
And that 's the reason why California has certain sections looking at the possibility of a lockdown , " Fauci said . 
Roughly 33 million of California 's 39 million residents , about 85 % of the nation 's most populous state , are under new stay at home orders The state reported more than 30,000 new cases on Sunday , a record high for California .
