Rep . 
John Garamendi , a Democratic member who represents the area between San Francisco and Sacramento , said today that briefers in the room this morning pushed back on the whistleblower complaint that public health officials were not properly trained or protected at March Air Force Base when they went to meet incoming travelers from China . 
However , he said briefers could not answer a question about whether they believed the whistleblower was wrong about what occurred at Travis Air Force base . 
Garamendi said some members will be briefed again this afternoon . 
He said he did not know who all would be invited to that briefing : It may just be more California members , but he said others may be invited as well . 
Garamendi said he is largely concerned about the fact that a patient who presented symptoms for days was not tested for coronavirus because of the protocols that had been established by CDC . 
He said it put health workers in the first facility in Vacaville , California at great risk and that 84 health workers at the first facility where the patient was have been sent home to self monitor because of risk of exposure . 
" They have not been tested yet because tests as of this morning were not available , " he said . 
" Those people quite possibly have been infected . 
Similarly , there are other hospitals in the Sacramento region whose personnel have been exposed . "
