A longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and infectious disease expert said the lack of novel coronavirus test kits has been a " bottleneck . " 
A flaw in the CDC issued test kits delayed testing abilities in nearly all state and local public health labs . 
The CDC has issued new testing protocols that should allow as many as 40 labs to begin testing soon . 
And despite the newest US case — a California patient with an infection with an unknown origin — Schaffner was confident about the US response . 
" We ’re still in very good shape here in the United States . 
We ’ve had very few cases . 
They ’ve been well identified , well cared for , and public health is working hard , having identified all the contacts , " he said . 
" Now , this California case changes the equation , of course . 
Where did that person get their infection ? 
That investigation is currently very much under way . 
And we ’re all watching that very , very carefully . 
So far , so good , but we expect more introductions of the virus . 
That ’s inevitable . "
