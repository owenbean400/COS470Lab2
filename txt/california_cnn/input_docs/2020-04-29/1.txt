The Southern California city of Newport Beach voted on Tuesday in a City Council meeting to keep its beaches open . 
But additional reinforcements will enforce social distancing to protect against the coronavirus pandemic . 
An ordinance was proposed to close the city 's beaches for the next three weekends to avoid the overcrowding seen this past weekend , but council members did not end up voting directly on the agenda items during the meeting . 
Instead , Councilman Kevin Muldoon made an alternate motion to deny the item , which passed on a 5-2 vote , according to the city 's public information manager . 
Increased police and lifeguard presence will actively enforce social distancing . 
The majority of the city 's council members expressed a strong desire to keep most public beaches , parks and open spaces accessible for the mental health and physical well being of residents , according to a statement . 
The vote comes as many states prepare to begin loosening restrictions and phase out stay at home orders .
