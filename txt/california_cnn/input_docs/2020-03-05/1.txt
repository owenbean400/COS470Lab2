The Grand Princess cruise ship that was scheduled to arrive in San Francisco this evening has been delayed , California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom announced in a press conference today . 
The ship is currently off the coast and its arrival has been delayed to provide an opportunity for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the US Coast Guard and state health officials to conduct tests on the ship as there are a number of passengers and crew members that have developed symptoms of the coronavirus , Newsom said . 
These groups and organizations are flying test kits to the cruise ship and the samples will subsequently be sent to the state â€™s public health lab in Richmond for testing , according to Newsom .
