National Nurses United says 80 of its members nationwide are currently self quarantined due to the novel coronavirus . 
Speaking at a press conference today , Bonnie Castillo , a registered nurse and executive director of National Nurses United , said , " it is not a successful strategy to leave nurses and other health care workers unprotected so that one patient can sideline so many workers at once . " 
During the press conference , Deborah Burger , president of California Nurses Association , read a letter from an anonymous nurse who works in California and is currently self quarantined . 
In the letter , the nurse said they are struggling to get a test , despite developing a fever after caring for a patient who tested positive for novel coronavirus . 
The nurse is currently waiting to get a test , the letter said . 
" This is not a ticket dispenser at the deli counter . 
It 's a public health emergency , delaying this test puts the whole community at risk , " the letter added .
