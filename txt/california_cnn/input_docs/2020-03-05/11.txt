The US Coast Guard is currently dropping novel coronavirus test kits to a cruise ship off the coast of California , said Ken Cuccinelli , acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security . 
Cuccinelli , speaking at a Senate Homeland Security hearing on coronavirus , said they â€™ve been in communication with the cruise ship and have been working with it for days . 
He said they learned a lot of " negative lessons " from how the Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined . 
Cuccinelli said the initial thought was to hunker down , and that would have worked , but it was not done well . 
" First of all , let 's be clear about what we learned . 
That was a bad quarantine . 
That was not a successful quarantine situation and not just because the virus spread , that was a secondary effect of the bad quarantine , " Cuccinelli said . 
The Coast Guard is flying test kits out to the ship , " so we have greater clarity on exactly what we 're contending with , " Cuccinelli added .
