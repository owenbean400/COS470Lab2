An intensive care unit doctor in California said the coronavirus pandemic is the worst he ’s seen . 
" It ’s been horrible … This is by far the worst that it ’s been in the last nine months , " said Dr . Thomas Yadegar , ICU director at Providence Cedars Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in California . 
Patients are sicker than he ’s previously seen and some are getting intubated while in the emergency room , he said . 
Yadegar said he asked a patient this week why he did not come into the hospital sooner , and the patient told him that he did not want to take someone else ’s bed . 
ICU bed capacity has plunged to nearly zero in portions of the state .
