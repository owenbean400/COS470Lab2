Carlos Davis used to have about 200 clients drop by his CUT ology barbershop in Albany , Georgia , every day . 
On Friday , the first day he was allowed to reopen since the coronavirus pandemic began , around 30 clients came in . 
Wearing gloves , a construction face mask and a face shield , Davis said he was taking precautions to protect staff and clients .
