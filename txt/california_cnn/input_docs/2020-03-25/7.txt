House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats that it 's important to " recognize the good " in the $ 2 trillion stimulus package that 's aimed at providing a jolt to an economy struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The legislation , if it passes Congress , would be the largest emergency aid package in US history . 
Pelosi appeared on Wednesday to be sending a message to progressives in her caucus who are criticizing the bill . 
" What is important is for us to recognize the good that is in the bill , appreciate it for what it does . 
Do not judge it for what it does not because we have more bills to come , " the California Democrat told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on " The Situation Room . " 
" At the start of all this we had two bills , which were about emergencies ... and the emergency is not over , but the focus was on those two bills . 
Now we 're mitigating for the damage of it all to the health and to the livelihood of the American people . 
That is in this bill . 
And then we will go forward for recovery . 
Emergency , mitigation , recovery , " she said .
