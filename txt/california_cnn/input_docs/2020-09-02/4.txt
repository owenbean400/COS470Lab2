Los Angeles County health officials announced that K 12 schools can resume limited on campus teaching for students most in need of in person learning . 
The decision allows for K 12 students with Individualized education plans , those requiring English as a second language instruction and others needing assessments or specialized in school services to return to campuses for in person learning starting on Sept . 14 . 
Under state guidelines , schools located in counties in California â€™s first reopening tier , where coronavirus risk remains " widespread , " cannot reopen to all students for in person learning . 
However , state rules allow for school officials to apply for a waiver to reopen grades K 6 only to students if the coronavirus daily case rate falls below 200 per 100,000 residents , a metric Los Angeles County now meets . 
On Wednesday , health officials said they will not yet be opening the waiver program for elementary schools while it monitors the implementation of the new K 12 in person learning program for students with specialized needs .
