Lenzilumab , an antibody therapy , reduced the relative risk of death or need for ventilation by 80 % for Covid 19 patients , according to a new study . 
California based biopharmaceutical company Humanigen said Tuesday it has been evaluating the drug in an ongoing late stage drug trial . 
How the study was conducted : It involved 39 patients who had risk factors for poor outcomes and Covid 19 pneumonia . 
Twelve were treated with the antibody therapy , and the remaining 27 received standard care . 
How the two groups compared : Patients who received the antibody therapy saw signs of significant improvement in inflammatory markers , and were discharged from hospital in a median of five days -- compared to 11 days for those who got standard care . 
Patients who got the therapy had an 8 % risk of death or needing a ventilator , compared to 41 % for the standard care group . 
The antibody therapy patients took one day ( on median ) to recover from the cytokine storm -- which is when the body 's overactive immune response begins to attack its own cells rather than just the virus . 
For the standard care group , that median recovery time was eight days . 
What is the therapy ? 
Lenzilumab is a monoclonal antibody â€“ a lab engineered version of an immune system molecule that attacks a single target . 
It was originally developed to treat certain forms of leukemia , but because it tamps down the inflammatory response , researchers have been trying it out in coronavirus patients . 
A larger randomized , placebo controlled clinical trial is underway at multiple sites across the US . 
The company expects the trial to be complete sometime in September .
