The influential coronavirus model at the University of Washington is projecting 562,000 Americans will have died from Covid 19 by April 1 , 2021 -- up significantly from the prediction it made last week , when it forecast 502,000 deaths by that date . 
The model from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) says the increase is due to surges in cases and deaths , with particularly large increases in California . 
This is putting a huge amount of stress on the hospital system . 
" Overall , we expect the national daily death toll to continue increasing to a peak of over 3,750 in mid January , " the statement reads . 
Mitigating factors : The vaccination rollout could save as many as 34,500 lives by April 1 , IHME predicts . 
The institute again stressed the importance of mask wearing to keep the numbers down . 
IHME analyzed mobility across the US and found that visits to restaurants and bars declined in November following increases over the summer .
