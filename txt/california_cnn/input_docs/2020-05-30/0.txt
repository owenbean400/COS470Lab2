A 5-4 Supreme Court ruling has rejected a request from a California church to block limitations on the number of people who could attend religious services during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberals on the bench , and wrote separately to explain his vote . 
The thrust to reopen churches has become one of the latest debates in the coronavirus culture wars . 
As states across the country have been gradually reopening their cities , some churches have argued that they are being treated differently than other businesses or groups . 
Justices Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito , Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would have granted the church â€™s request . 
Kavanaugh , writing for Thomas and Gorsuch , said the church would suffer " irreparable harm from not being able to hold services on Pentecost Sunday in a way that comparable secular businesses and persons can conduct their activities . "
