Stanford University , in California 's Santa Clara County , has confirmed two new cases of the coronavirus â€“ one from Stanford Medicine and another case from the main campus . 
A faculty member of Stanford Medicine was also confirmed with a case of coronavirus last week , bringing the university 's total to three cases , Stanford said in a letter to its community . 
Stanford and health officials are now working to conduct contact tracing on the patients . 
The letter added that the university would not provide additional information on the patients to protect their privacy . 
Stanford is holding online classes : The university canceled all in person classes for the final two weeks of its winter quarter , and will continue with online classes during the spring quarter . 
Stanford is also asking students who live on campus to leave at the end of the quarter if possible . 
This comes as a wave of universities across the nation enact similar measures . 
Harvard University , for instance , gave students five days to move out of their dorms -- sparking panic and anger among some students , who complained of inadequate administration support .
