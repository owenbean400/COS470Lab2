Most schools in California will not be reopening for in person education this month -- but one superintendent in the Los Angeles area has come up with a plan to welcome some students back to class . 
And it does not involve their teachers . 
On August 19 , when Glendale Unified School District kicks off the academic year , 20 of the district 's elementary schools will open some empty classrooms for remote learning . 
But instead of the traditional 24 students per classroom , there will be no more than 12 . 
School officials are calling the group a " technology pod , " which will be supervised by a single substitute teacher or district staffer . 
The staffers wo not be teaching the students -- they will instead be present to offer computer technical assistance , monitor students ' mask use , enforce social distancing and keep students focused on their work . 
Superintendent Vivian Ekchian said she came up with the idea after noticing that many young children of essential workers did not have proper childcare when schools were forced to pivot to remote learning in March due to the Covid 19 pandemic .
