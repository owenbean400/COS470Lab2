California schools will reopen when the data shows it is safe to do so , according to California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom " I ’m not worried about the latest tweets , " he said , in a thinly veiled reference to President Trump . 
" We need to address safely reopening schools . 
That to me is non negotiable , " the governor said at a news conference . 
Reopening schools will be based on local conditions in the state , but Newsom added that " we must insist upon learning at the beginning of the school year . " 
" Given our current data and the ongoing community transmission of this deadly virus , it ’s prudent that school districts prepare a distance learning back up plan that is ready to be implemented in the event that our data shows us this is the safest path forward , " the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement to CNN . 
Anticipating that schools will continue to be a topic of conversation , Newsom implored the public that reopening is contingent on behavior .
