Richard Stitely had spent nearly 30 years on death row when the pandemic hit California 's San Quentin State Prison . 
Last week , the 71 year old was found dead in his cell , marking the first known fatality linked to coronavirus inside the California prison with the largest outbreak of Covid 19 in the state . 
More than a third of incarcerated people in San Quentin have tested positive for the virus and nearly half of coronavirus cases throughout the state 's prison system are there , according to a tally from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . 
As of Thursday , there were at least 1,345 active cases in the facility and 2,783 cases in the state , the CDCR said . 
The jail houses about 3,400 detainees and is at 112 % of its capacity . 
Authorities are still trying to determine the cause and manner of Stitely 's death , as well as another death row inmate who died on Wednesday .
