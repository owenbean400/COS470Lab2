What began as an emergency solution to provide housing for California ’s homeless population during the coronavirus pandemic has turned into a more permanent solution . 
The housing program , initially called " Project Roomkey " secures hotel and motel space for individuals experiencing homelessness . 
When California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom signed the state ’s revised budget Monday , he devoted $ 900 million to buying hotels , motels , tiny home , pre fab homes , and apartment buildings to facilitate a permanent version of the program , now called " Project Home Key . " 
So far , more than 14,000 people have been provided with a place to live and access to support services through the initiative , according to Newsom . 
Other states , including Connecticut and Hawaii , are looking to replicate the same program , he said . 
The funding comes from a state partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency , as well as private donations . 
Newsom credited Blue Shield and Kaiser for providing $ 45 million in funding for the project .
