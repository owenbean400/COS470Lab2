California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom plans to announce more restrictions for Californians as coronavirus cases swell in the state . 
The governor has repeatedly promised that reopening the state comes with the ability to " toggle back " if necessary . 
Today , Newsom said more announcements regarding restrictions and enforcement will come tomorrow . 
California is among at least 17 states that have paused or rolled back their reopening plans in response to a rise in new infections . 
On Sunday , the governor shut bars back down across seven counties and recommended their closure in several more . 
Responding to a reporter 's question about the beaches being closed in Los Angeles County for the Fourth of July weekend , the governor hinted that state beaches could be part of his announcement tomorrow . 
As the holiday weekend looms , Newsom warned that family gatherings are of the greatest concern around the spread of coronavirus in the state . 
Family gatherings where households mix with extended family , tend to be a place where people let their guard down , the governor said . 
" It ’s not just bars , not just out in the streets with people protesting , and the like , " Newsom said . 
Acknowledging that family gatherings are part of the holiday tradition , he insisted that directives will be more aggressive as they relate to face coverings and physical distancing . 
" We bent the curve in the state of California once . 
We will bend the curve again . 
Mark my words . 
We will crush this pandemic . 
We will annihilate it . 
We will get past this , but we ’re gonna have to be tougher , " Newsom said .
