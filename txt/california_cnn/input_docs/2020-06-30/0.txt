In one of the most drastic rollbacks of reopenings yet , Arizona is closing bars , gyms , movie theaters and other businesses for 30 days amid a " brutal " increase in Covid 19 cases , Gov . 
Doug Ducey said Monday . 
Water parks and tubing must also close , Ducey said at a news conference , and events with more than 50 people are prohibited . 
The pullback comes as the state has seen a surge in Covid 19 cases recently . 
There are now almost 75,000 reported infections , up from 46,689 cases 10 days ago . 
The largest increase is from those between the ages of 20 and 44 who now make up 22 % of hospitalizations in Arizona , Ducey said . 
Sixteen other states have either pulled back on reopenings or have put them on pause as their cases jump . 
Bars were ordered to close back down in Texas and parts of California . 
In some of South Florida , beaches were directed to close again during the upcoming holiday weekend , and on premises alcohol consumption has been suspended in bars statewide .
