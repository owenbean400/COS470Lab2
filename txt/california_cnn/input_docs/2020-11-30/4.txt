California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said he is considering " drastic action , " including reinstating a stay at home order , as projections show the surge of Covid 19 cases will cause the state 's intensive care unit capacity to be overrun by Christmas Eve . 
Hospitalizations could double or triple within the next month if there are no major changes , he said . 
They are expected to reach 78 % of capacity statewide with even higher numbers in Southern California and other areas , Newsom said in a news conference . 
Los Angeles County reported today a total of 400,919 confirmed cases of Covid 19 since the start of the pandemic , a grim new milestone as the virus continues to " run rampant through almost every part of the county , " the county 's Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a news conference . 
Daily hospitalizations in Los Angeles also sharply increased 93 % over the past week , according to latest county health data . 
There are currently 2,185 Covid 19 patients hospitalized in Los Angeles and it is very possible that the daily number of people hospitalized will soon be over 2,500 , Ferrer said .
