The NFL 's San Francisco 49ers will play their next two home games in Arizona . 
The team was forced to find an alternative site after Santa Clara County , California , banned contact sports for the next three weeks . 
The 49ers are now set to host the Buffalo Bills next Monday night at the Arizona Cardinals ’ home ground , State Farm Stadium in Glendale , Arizona . 
The team will utilize the stadium again the following Sunday to play the Washington Football Team on Dec . 13 . 
The 49ers will play three of their next four games at State Farm Stadium as the team was previously scheduled to play the Cardinals in Glendale the day after Christmas . 
The team has yet to announce plans on where it will hold practices . 
Some background : The restrictive measures was prompted by an " exponential " growth in Covid 19 cases and hospitalizations in the county , according to County Counsel James Williams . 
Other measures include modifying capacity for businesses , limiting social gatherings . 
" The 49ers are , I think , the most nationally obvious example , but there is no family in our community that is untouched by this pandemic , " Williams told CNN on Monday , noting that the pandemic has complicated everyone ’s lives and communities . 
Hospitalizations have doubled in the last 14 days , he said , and capacity is a priority . 
" Our ICU beds are filling up , hospitals are filling up , we are trying to take every possible measure locally to rein that in , " said Williams .
