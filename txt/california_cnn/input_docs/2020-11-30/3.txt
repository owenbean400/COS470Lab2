California expects to receive about 327,000 doses of Pfizer ’s Covid 19 vaccine by mid December , and a second dose within three weeks , according to Gov . 
Gavin Newsom , who declined to give an exact date the doses are expected . 
" We sprint with light , very bright light at the end of the tunnel not a marathon but a sprint to the vaccine , " said Newsom . 
Recommendations on how to distribute the first doses of the vaccine will be made this week , as guidelines on how exactly to prioritize distribution are still being drafted . 
The state ’s task force is also working on the challenge of keeping the vaccines at ultra low temperatures . 
Decision makers are looking at the plan with a specific eye on equity . 
Health care sectors and those working with vulnerable populations will be prioritized , but a more detailed breakdown of who gets the vaccine first will be outlined later this week , Newsom promised . 
He did not have an estimate on when the broader public could expect to be vaccinated . 
As many residents are expected to have questions about the safety of the vaccine , California has convened an 11 member Scientific Safety Committee than will review the same data the US Food and Drug Administration has , but from a California perspective . 
Newsom classified the group ’s work as " basically a stamp of approval . "
