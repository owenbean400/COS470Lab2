California will spend $ 42 million to protect foster kids and vulnerable families during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Much of that money will be spent on 59,000 youth in foster care across the state , and by providing an extra $ 200 per month for the 25,000 most at risk families in an effort to help keep vulnerable families together . 
Other programs receiving extra funding include family resource centers , expanding telephone helplines , and providing laptops and cell phones for foster children in need of that technology . 
Gov . 
Gavin Newsom described how he grew up in a family with his foster brother , Steven Ashby . 
He noted that caring for at risk children is a challenge , especially because visits from Child Protective Services are limited under the stay at home orders . 
Without school and other activities , reports are down , the governor said . 
The timeline for emancipation of teens aging out of the system will be extended , permitting them to remain in foster care for the time being .
