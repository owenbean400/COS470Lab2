It 's at the top of most people 's list of coronavirus questions : " When will I be able to go outside regularly ? " 
It 's not an easy question to answer for the same reason that trying to figure out how many people will die from the virus is difficult to know — modeling this thing is hard . 
There are loads of different models ( more on that from CNN 's Daily DC podcast last week ) . 
And each has its own assumptions about many things , including how much social distancing there will be and how quickly the virus can spread from one person to another . 
That 's why you 've been seeing the projected number of people die change , as we 've done more social distancing and more information becomes available . 
CNN 's Arman Azad notes in a piece out earlier today that one of most prominent models — the one from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — says we 'll have no more deaths after June 21 . 
As the piece details , that seems quite unlikely . 
The same model has peak deaths occurring right about now . 
The model makes a lot of assumptions , which are necessary to model . 
Some of those are likely to be wrong . 
Other models , like one the state of California uses , differ greatly . 
It suggests deaths in California wo not peak until mid or late May . 
A number of experts think that is too pessimistic . 
All models are dependent on how much distancing we do . 
Looking at a host of models wo not give you all the answers , though it can given a fuller picture : First , the peak ( depending on the state and region of the country ) could be in the next few weeks to a month . 
Second , deaths may slow over the summer , though it 's quite unlikely we 'll hit zero . 
Third , there is a real chance of some sort of resurgence this fall .
