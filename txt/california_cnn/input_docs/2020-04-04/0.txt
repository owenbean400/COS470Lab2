Los Angeles County has recorded 1,000 coronavirus cases in just 48 hours , the mayor said on Friday . 
Los Angeles County had a 13 % increase in cases Friday -- the third day in a row of low teens or mid teen increases , the mayor said . 
This is a decrease from the previous week , when the city saw almost a 27 % increase on average each day . 
" A week ago , the rate of increase was about 50 % more than it is right now , " Garcetti said . 
" But on the other hand , before you start to get relaxed and say we can go outside , this is a moment to continue pressing on the accelerator . " 
More than 40,000 Angelenos have been tested for Covid 19 , and Los Angeles has the capacity to do 3,500 tests a day in the coming week , Garcetti said . 
It has been 15 days since California has been under stay at home orders -- and 19 days since Los Angeles started social distancing .
