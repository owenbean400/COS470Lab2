California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said that 126,700 individuals have been tested for coronavirus statewide , according to a press conference he held on Saturday " That testing number may sound high to some . 
It is low to many others and certainly to me , " Newsom said . 
Out of the 126,700 tests that have been administered , the state is still waiting on results for 13,000 individuals . 
" We have substantially reduced that backlog , a lot of that had to do with the commercial labs stepping up , " Newsom said . 
The governor admittedly " owned up " to the largest county in the state not providing data collection in real time to Californians saying , " you deserve better and more and we are going to do just that . " 
What else is being done : In the last week or so , Newsom â€™s office created a newly formed task force led by private and public sector leaders tasked with handling coronavirus testing headed by co chairs Paul Markovich , president and CEO of Blue Shield of California , and Dr . Charity Dean , an Assistant Director at California Dept . of Public Health .
