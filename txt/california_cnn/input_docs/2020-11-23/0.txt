California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said in a tweet that he and his entire family tested negative for Covid 19 on Sunday , after three of his children were exposed to an officer from the California Highway Patrol who tested positive . 
According to the tweet , Newsom and his wife Jen learned of their children â€™s exposure late Friday evening . 
Newsom said he and his wife did not have any direct interaction with the infected officer , and wished the officer a speedy recovery . 
Although they tested negative , the whole family will be quarantining for 14 days " consistent with local guidance , " said the tweet . 
Remember : You can test negative and still be infected and contagious . 
The virus ' incubation period goes up to 14 days -- so even if you have already contracted Covid 19 , it can take days to show up on a test . 
Justin Lessler , associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , said the virus takes time to replicate inside the body -- so getting tested before the third day after exposure " is not of much use , " he said . 
That 's why experts urge people to still quarantine after they 've been exposed , even if they tested negative .
