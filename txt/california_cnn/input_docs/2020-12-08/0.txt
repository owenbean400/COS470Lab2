More than two thirds of California residents will soon receive emergency text alerts from the state ’s Emergency Operations Services asking them to stay at home and abide by the newly enacted health orders , according to a tweet from Cal OES . 
Those living in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley – about 27 million people – will be asked to stay home with the exception of seeking essential services . 
The alerts will be sent starting today at noon local time . 
Both regions found themselves under the new health order Sunday night as intensive care unit capacity in each fell under the 15 % threshold set by Gov . 
Gavin Newsom .
