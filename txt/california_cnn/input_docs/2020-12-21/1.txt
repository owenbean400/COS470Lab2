As Covid 19 tightens its grip on California , one in every 64 Los Angeles County residents is infected with the virus and is " actively infecting others , " L.A . County Health Services Director Christina Ghaly estimates . 
In an interview with Poppy Harlow on CNN ’s Newsroom , Ghaly said because of the widespread infections , the county ’s hospitals are full . 
About half of all ICU patients are suffering from Covid 19 , and about a third of regular beds are filled with Covid patients . 
ICU Capacity in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley remains at zero , with just 2.1 % of ICU beds availability statewide . 
At this point , Los Angeles hospitals are not turning away patients , nor are they rationing care . 
" Obviously that 's a situation nobody wants to be in and we 're not there in Los Angeles County and we 're not there in California , but the hospitals are under stress , " said Ghaly . 
She expressed concern that holiday gatherings will lead to another surge in two to three weeks . 
Guidelines on how L.A . County hospitals could prioritize patients by rationing care have been circulated among doctors at some area hospitals , according to a report from the Los Angeles Times . 
Without enough staff to save every patient , doctors may soon be faced with just trying to save as many as possible . 
" It 's heartbreaking really to see where we 're at , at this point in the pandemic . 
We 're so close to the end with the very same time that we 're battling this scourge in Los Angeles County , " Ghaly lamented . 
California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom is under quarantine for the second time , as he was recently in contact with staffer who has tested positive for Covid 19 , and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is quarantining after his nine year old daughter tested positive for the virus last week . 
Both politicians have tested negative
