The number of Californians being ordered to stay home has risen to more than 21 million people . 
On Thursday evening , Los Angeles County officials told more than 10 million residents to stay home . 
When added to the roughly 11 million Californians under similar orders , it brings the total number to more than 21 million . 
That means more than half of all Californians are now living under what equates to a shelter in place order . 
The revised emergency order -- dubbed " Safer at Home " -- goes into effect at midnight . 
Those restrictions will not apply to emergency workers and food workers . 
But it does mean that all non essential businesses are being closed . 
LA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger had no estimate on how long the restrictions would last , but assured the public that this is only temporary .
