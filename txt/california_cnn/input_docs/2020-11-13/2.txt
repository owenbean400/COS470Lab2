Disney CEO Bob Chapek blasted California officials for the state ’s restrictions on theme parks , which the company blames for Disneyland ’s continued closure . 
Last month , California officials released strict guidelines for how theme parks in the state can safely reopen . 
Orange County , where Disneyland is located , is currently in the second " red " tier of the state 's four tier reopening system , which represents a " substantial " spread of the virus . 
Under state guidelines , all theme parks must remain closed under this tier . 
Chapek accuses state leadership of using " arbitrary standards " without considering how Disney is " successfully " operating its other parks around the world . 
Disneyland has been closed since March . 
The chief executive also suggested that the state ’s restrictions are " decimating small businesses in the local community . " 
CNN has reached out to California Governor Gavin Newson 's office for comment .
