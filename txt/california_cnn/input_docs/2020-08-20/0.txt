Covid 19 cases are declining across the United States and it ’s clear " trends are going in the right direction , " Adm . Dr . Brett Giroir said during a US Department of Health and Human Services telebriefing on Wednesday . 
" We have very good data -- theoretical and real data -- that the plans that we ’re implementing are working , and will continue to work -- and will continue to work just about equivalently to a shutdown , " Giroir said . 
Giroir says wearing a mask , staying a safe distance away , and washing your hands along with testing " continues to yield results . " 
Giroir , the assistant secretary for health at HHS , said new cases are down 22 % since their peak in July -- but noted that " tragically , " deaths are the lagging indicator and still remain flat . 
More data : Giroir said of the 56 US jurisdictions , 80 % ( 45 out of 56 ) are currently in a declining pattern when it comes to new cases . 
Six of the 56 are flat . 
He said five are in an upward trajectory -- Guam , Hawaii , California , Indiana and Vermont .
