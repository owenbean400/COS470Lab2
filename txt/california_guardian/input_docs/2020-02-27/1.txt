Officials in California are scrambling to retrace the movements of a woman in the state who is believed to be the first person in the US to contract the coronavirus with no known connection to travel abroad or other known causes . 
Sonia Angell , director of the California Department of Public Health , said on Thursday that the woman , who has not been identified , lives in Solano County in northern California . 
The county is home to Travis Air Force Base , where dozens of people infected in China or on cruise ships have been treated . 
But there was no evidence the woman had connections to the base .
