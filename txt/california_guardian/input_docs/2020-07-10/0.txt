US prison officials have announced California will release up to 8,000 people from state prisons to curb the spread of Covid 19 throughout the institutions . 
Officials on Friday announced three separate efforts , approved by the governor , Gavin Newsom , that they say will decrease the prison population by 8 , ooo by the end of August . 
The measures mark the largest release efforts the state administration has taken since Covid 19 began to circulate among prison staff and incarcerated people . 
The first initiative expands a previous effort to expedite the release of people with 180 or fewer days left on their sentences to include people serving time for serious felonies . 
The second measure is an immediate review of cases of people with less than a year left to serve in eight prisons that have large populations at high risk of developing Covid 19 complications .
