Disney will lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division , the company said , as its resorts struggle with limited attendance amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
Disney has reopened all of its parks except California ’s Disneyland . 
About two thirds of the laid off employees are part time workers , the company said in a statement . 
Disney shut its theme parks around the world when the coronavirus began spreading earlier this year . 
All but Disneyland gradually reopened , though the company was forced to limit the number of visitors to allow for social distancing . 
" We have made the very difficult decision to begin the process of reducing our workforce at our Parks , Experiences and Products segment at all levels , " Josh D ’Amaro , chairman of the parks unit , said in a statement . 
He cited the parks ’ limited capacity and continued uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic , which he said was " exacerbated in California by the state ’s unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen " .
