Newly identified cases soared in California over the 4 July weekend , stressing some hospital systems and leading to the temporary closure of the state capitol building in Sacramento for deep cleaning , local officials have said . 
The number of people hospitalised has increased by 50 % over the past two weeks to about 5,800 , according to the state governor Gavin Newsom . 
The Reuters news agency reported that state and local records showed about a third of those hospitalised were in Los Angeles County , with about 630 confirmed and suspected virus patients requiring intensive care . 
And 25 % of the hospitalisations in the county in July were among patients aged between 18 and 40 years , health officials said , as new cases increasingly hit a younger population that may have been lax about safety precautions in recent weeks . 
Further north , nearly 1,400 inmates at San Quentin state prison have contracted the virus , putting pressure on hospitals in Marin County , where the facility is located , Newsom said . 
In all , 271,684 Californians have tested positive , including 11,529 in the past 24 hours , state records show . 
About 6,300 have died .
