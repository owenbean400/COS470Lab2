California theme park executives said legal action was among the options they were exploring to hasten the reopening of the industry in the state . 
" I think that all options are open at this point . 
We are going to continue to explore our options , " Erin Guerrero , the executive director of the Californian Attractions and Parks Associations told a news conference when asked whether legal action was being considered . 
California health secretary Mark Ghaly said on Tuesday that theme parks with a capacity of more than 15,000 visitors must wait to resume business until a county ’s Covid 19 risk level drops to the lowest tier of " minimal " spread . 
Disneyland said the guidelines would keep the park " shuttered for the foreseeable future . " 
" The concept of trying to come up with a collaborative solution is the end goal for all of us , " Ken Potrock , president of the Disneyland resort , said at Wednesday ’s news conference .
