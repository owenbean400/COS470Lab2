After weeks of railing against what he claimed were the potential risks of voting by mail , president Donald Trump has urged voters in at least one Republican state - Florida - to vote by any means . 
Trump , who is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in polls , has repeatedly warned in recent weeks - without evidence - that mail in voting carries more risks than voting by absentee ballot and could result in widespread fraud . 
Voting by mail has been embraced as a way to limit exposure to Covid 19 . 
Most absentee ballots are also conducted by mail . 
On Tuesday , Trump suggested there was no difference after all , and urged voters in the key state of Florida to trust their voting system . 
" Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting , in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure , Tried and True .

# MAGA White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany said the president remained concerned about " mass mail out voting , " such as that planned in Nevada and California ’s Los Angeles county , but not absentee ballots that require a proactive request by voters . 
Trump on Monday vowed to sue Nevada , which plans to send mail in ballots to every voter ahead of the 3 November presidential election in light of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Colorado , Hawaii , Oregon , Utah and Washington already conduct their elections entirely by mail , while California and Vermont have decided to do so this year due to the pandemic . 
The issue has spawned partisan litigation in dozens of states over issues like absentee ballots and signature requirements . 
Democrats and voting rights groups have warned that cost saving measures instituted at the Postal Service by a Trump financial backer who is now the postmaster general could lead to delays in service just as voting by mail ramps up .
