Marathon Petroleum , the largest US oil refiner by volume , plans to permanently close two refineries in Martinez , California , and Gallup , New Mexico , the company said , in response to lower demand for fuel . 
The company had earlier idled the two refineries following weak demand due to Covid 19 outbreaks in the US . 
US refiners on average suspended about 20 % of total processing capacity when vehicle and air travel reduced . 
Marathon said it plans to use the Martinez facility , California â€™s fourth largest , as an oil storage facility , and is evaluating its future use to produce diesel fuel from industry waste and used cooking oil . 
The company is scheduled to report its second quarter results on Monday . 
Spokespeople did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether the closures would require a charge to earnings . 
Up to 800 workers face job losses combined at the 161,000 barrels per day Martinez and 27,000 barrels per day Gallup refineries beginning in October , the company said . 
" We do not anticipate supply disruptions in these regions , and we will continue to utilize our integrated system to meet customer commitments , " the company said in a statement on its website .
