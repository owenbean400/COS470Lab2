California has recorded a half million coronavirus cases in the past two weeks , overwhelming emergency rooms across the state . 
The state could be facing a once unthinkable scenario of nearly 100,000 hospitalisations within a month , the governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday . 
Newsom , himself quarantined for the second time in two months , said a state projection model shows previously unfathomable hospitalisation numbers . 
He is likely to extend his stay at home order for much of the state next week . 
Dr Mark Ghaly , California â€™s health secretary , said it is feared entire areas of the state may run out of room even in their makeshift " surge " capacity units " by the end of the month and early in January " . 
In response , the state is updating its planning guide for how hospitals would ration care if people cannot receive the treatment they need , Ghaly said . 
" Our goal is to make sure those plans are in place , but work hard to make sure no one has to put them into place anywhere in California , " he said .
