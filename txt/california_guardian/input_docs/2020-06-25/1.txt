More from the Guardian ’s Mario Koran in California : Despite the grim report on the rise in new coronavirus cases , governor Gavin Newsom maintained his characteristically stoic delivery , encouraging Californians to continue to do their part by wearing masks and keeping safe distances . 
It ’s only because of the steps taken , he said , that the state has been able to avoid the worst case scenario he floated in March , when he said more than half the state , roughly 25 million residents , could contract the virus over the next eight weeks . 
" We are not victims of fate , " said Newsom . 
" We can manifest the future . " 
He praised the decision by Disney to push back its reopening date , originally set for 17 July , after cases spiked in and around Los Angeles . 
The governor also unveiled the creation of an open source portal for members of the public to scour coronavirus data , a platform he said was partly created in an effort " to back up the health professionals " .
