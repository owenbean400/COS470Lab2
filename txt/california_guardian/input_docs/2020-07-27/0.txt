Nearly 200 federal healthcare workers have been deployed to California ’s Central Valley , where hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid 19 cases as new infection rates soar , governor Gavin Newsom said . 
The arrival over the past several days of Department of Defense personnel will help hospitals in the stricken region , where some hospitals and intensive care units are two thirds full of Covid 19 patients . 
That has left little room for people who are ill from other conditions and is putting immense pressure on doctors , nurses and other healthcare workers trained in providing care to the sickest patients . 
To combat the virus ’ spread , the state is committing $ 52m to the eight counties that make up the San Joaquin Valley , Newsom said . 
The state is also dispatching strike teams of health care workers , employee safety specialists and business regulators to the San Joaquin Valley to educate and persuade residents and employers to adopt public health practices such as social distancing and wearing masks . 
As many as 18 % of those tested are showing to be infected with the coronavirus , more than twice the level as the state as a whole , Newsom said . 
The spread is being driven by a number of factors , including community and family gatherings , work in close quarters in agricultural businesses , nursing homes and prisons , he said . 
California is one of several US states that has become a hotspot for a second wave of coronavirus cases . 
An average of 109 Californians have died daily over the past two weeks , Newsom said , and nearly 8 % of those tested for the coronavirus are confirmed to have contracted it , he said . 
The state has rolled back efforts to re open its economy , closing bars , banning indoor restaurant dining and postponing the resumption of in person school instruction in 37 counties that are home to 93 % of Californians .
