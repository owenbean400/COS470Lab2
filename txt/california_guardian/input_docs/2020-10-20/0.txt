Officials in California , home to Walt Disney ’s Disneyland , said large theme parks cannot reopen until a county ’s Covid 19 risk level drops to the lowest tier of " minimal " spread . 
Disneyland unions earlier had asked the state to let the resort , located in Anaheim , in Orange County , open when the county reached " moderate " spread .
