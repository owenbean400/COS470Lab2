There are no intensive care beds available in densely populated southern California or the state ’s agricultural San Joaquin Valley , together home to nearly 30 million people , amid a deadly surge of Covid 19 , the governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday . 
The pandemic is overwhelming hospitals in the most populous US state , even as the government and two of the nation ’s largest pharmacy chains began a nationwide campaign on Monday to vaccinate nursing home residents against the highly contagious respiratory disease . 
The US death toll from the virus has accelerated in recent weeks to 2,627 per day on a seven day average , according to a Reuters tally . 
The University of Washington ’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has said US Covid 19 deaths will peak in January , when its widely cited model projects that more than 100,000 people will die as the toll marches to nearly 562,000 by 1 April 2021 . 
Nationwide , the number of hospitalised patients on Monday stood at nearly 113,400 , near a record high of over 114,200 set on Friday , according to a Reuters tally . 
In California , Newsom told a remote news conference he had requested help from nurses , doctors and medical technicians in the US military . 
The state has also sent nearly 700 additional medical staff to beleaguered hospitals . 
California ’s secretary of health and human services Mark Ghaly said many hospitals in the state may also soon run out of room for patients who need to be admitted but do not require intensive care . 
Ghaly told the news conference the current surge was related to gatherings that took place over the Thanksgiving holiday and that a similar surge is expected after Christmas and New Year ’s . 
Newsom pleaded with Californians to comply with stay at home orders that restrict activity in most but not all of the state . 
" We are not victims of fate , " he said .
