Starting Friday , California will allow retailers to begin offering curbside pick up as the state moves deeper into " stage 2 " of its reopening plan , governor Gavin Newsom said . 
Manufactures and warehouses that support these retailers will also be allowed to reopen with modifications . 
Eventually the reopening plan in stage two will include some office spaces , dining at restaurants , shopping malls and outdoor museums , Dr Mark Ghaly , secretary of the California Health and Human Services , said . 
Ghaly said starting Friday , retailers can begin delivering items to customers ’ cars with gloves and a mask while using hands free devices that allow customers to pay . 
He added manufacturers should use outdoor spaces as break rooms and warehouses should carry sanitation materials when making deliveries . 
Stage 4 , the final stage in the state ’s reopening plan , will allow for large gatherings to resume , such as concerts and sporting events , Newsom said . 
However , he indicated that stage would occur once a vaccine is made available . 
California has been under a two month lockdown .
