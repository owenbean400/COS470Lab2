There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship , off the coast of California , and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus . 
The cruise operator said groups of guests and crew were being tested after a passenger on an earlier voyage died and at least one other became infected . 
It confirmed that 142 UK nationals - made up of 121 passengers and 21 crew - were on board the Grand Princess , which was carrying a total of 3,533 people . 
There had so far been no confirmed cases of Covid 19 on board , and that fewer than 100 people had been identified for testing , according to the operator . 
" Public health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all results have been received , " it said . 
" Out of an abundance of caution , all guests who have been identified for testing have been asked to remain in their staterooms . " 
Japanese authorities said last week that a British tourist who had been on board another of the company ’s cruise ships , the Diamond Princess - which was quarantined in Japan - had died after contracting coronavirus . 
Meanwhile , it has emerged that three passengers on the Grand Princess ’ previous voyage have been confirmed to have the new virus , and one of them reportedly became California ’s first fatality from the illness yesterday , after it disembarked hundreds at four Mexican ports last month . 
US health officials are working to track down other passengers who have returned home , but when Mexican health officials have not yet been notified by their counterparts , the Associated Press reported .
