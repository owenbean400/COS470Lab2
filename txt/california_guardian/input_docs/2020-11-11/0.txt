An update on our earlier post from Reuters . 
The New York governor Andrew Cuomo has imposed a new round of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus as the infection rate climbed and hospitalisations soared in the state that was the epicentre of the American outbreak in its early stages . 
Cuomo ordered bars , restaurants and gyms in the state to shut down on premises services at 10pm nightly , and capped the number of people who could attend private parties at 10 . 
The new measures , which take effect on Friday , came a day after California and several states across the Midwest tightened restrictions on residents on Tuesday to try to curb the rapid spread of the virus . 
" This is our LAST chance to stop a second wave , " the New York City mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted on Wednesday , as he announced the city wide seven day average rate of coronavirus tests coming back positive had hit 2.52 % . 
The city ’s public school system , the nation ’s largest , would be shut to in person learning if that figure reaches 3 % . 
" We can do it , but we have to act NOW , " de Blasio said . 
As Covid 19 infections , hospitalisations and deaths surge across the United States , more signs emerged that a second wave could engulf areas of the Northeast , which had managed to bring the pandemic under control after being battered last spring . 
The United States as a whole reported more than 1,450 deaths on Tuesday , the highest single day count since mid August , according to a Reuters analysis . 
It has also emerged that the country surpassed 1 million new confirmed cases in just the first 10 days of November ( see 1.04pm . ) .
