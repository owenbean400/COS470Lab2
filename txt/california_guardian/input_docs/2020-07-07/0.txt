A company belonging to Kanye West received millions in loans from a federal coronavirus stimulus package , raising questions about potential conflicts of interest given the rapper ’s ties to the Trump administration . 
On Monday , the US Small Business Administration released data on more than 40,000 companies that received loans of $ 150,000 ( approximately £ 120,000 ) or more under the payroll protection program ( PPP ) . 
As first reported by the Daily Beast , Yeezy LLC , a company established in Delaware but operated in California , received between $ 2m and $ 5m . 
PPP loans are available for companies with fewer than 500 employees . 
They are voided if companies spend the money on eligible costs and retain staff during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Loans are reduced if a company cuts full time employees or pay by more than 25 % . 
According to a survey by CNBC , only a small fraction of applications have been successful . 
West manages Yeezy LLC , which lists 160 employees and reported $ 1.5bn in revenue last year .
