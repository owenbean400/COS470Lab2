The number of patients hospitalised with Covid 19 in California has risen by 32 % over the past two weeks , and intensive care admissions have spiked by 30 % as the pandemic surges across the United States , the state â€™s health and human services secretary , Dr Mark Ghaly , said on Tuesday . 
Ghaly said three counties that are home to about 5.5 million people - San Diego , Sacramento and Stanislaus - must reverse their reopening plans and go back to the most restrictive tier of public health regulations aimed at slowing the spread of the virus . 
More counties will likely be required to roll back reopening in coming weeks , he said . 
In the most restrictive tier of regulation , indoor dining in restaurants is not allowed . 
Gyms and religious institutions are also not allowed to hold indoor activities . 
Ghaly said : We anticipate if things stay the way they are ... over half of California counties will have moved into a more restrictive tier by next week . .
