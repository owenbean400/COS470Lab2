White House coronavirus task force member and the US ’s foremost expert on infectious diseases Dr . Anthony Fauci is speaking now . 
" What is the most striking thing that is so sobering to us is when we see deaths . 
We know now that the mitigation we are doing is having a positive effect . 
But you do not see it until weeks later . " 
" But do not get complacent . " 
The health disparities in the African American community puts them at risk much more so than the rest of the population , he says . 
This virus " preys " on those risks . 
" To the young people to the older people in the community , protect yourself and please protect those who are susceptible . " 
" We are not going to solve the problem of those health disparities this month or next month , " he says , but what we can do now is protect those people who are much more at risk . 
" We know that mitigation does work ... keep your foot on the accelerator because that ’s what ’s going to get us through this . "
