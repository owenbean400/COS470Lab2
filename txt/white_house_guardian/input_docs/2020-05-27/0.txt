Reuters reports that New York governor Andrew Cuomo called on Congress to " stop abusing " New York and other Democratic controlled states and release more federal funds to help them combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Speaking after meeting Donald Trump at the White House , Cuomo said funding for states and local governments was essential to fostering a national recovery from the outbreak , which has killed almost 100,000 Americans and ravaged the economy . 
" States that bore the brunt of the pandemic account for one third of the national GDP , " said Cuomo , a Democrat whose state has been hit hardest by the outbreak . 
" How can you tell one third of the country to go to heck ? " 
" So my point to our friends in the Congress - stop abusing New York , stop abusing New Jersey , stop abusing Massachusetts and Illinois and Michigan and Pennsylvania - stop abusing the states who bore the brunt of the COVID virus through no fault of their own , " Cuomo said . 
Massachusetts has a Republican governor , but the other five states ’ governors are Democrats . 
States have sought more help from the federal government to get through the crisis . 
Democrats who control the House of Representatives passed legislation on 15 May that would provide nearly $ 1 trillion for state and local governments , but the bill was rejected by Trump and the Republican led Senate ’s leaders . 
Republican Senate majority leader Mitch Mc Connell last month suggested that states whose finances are depleted by the coronavirus pandemic could declare bankruptcy instead of receiving federal aid . 
The suggestion sparked outrage from some state leaders . 
Cuomo said his meeting with Trump on Wednesday focused on how to " supercharge " the economy by investing in infrastructure .
