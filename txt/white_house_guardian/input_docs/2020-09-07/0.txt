Donald Trump , accused by Joe Biden of putting lives at risk in his handling of the coronavirus , has called his Democratic rival " stupid " and demanded an apology for what Trump called anti vaccine rhetoric . 
Trailing in national opinion polls as the US death toll from the virus approaches 190,000 , Trump unleashed a broad attack against both the former vice president , his opponent in the 3 November election , and Biden ’s running mate , US senator Kamala Harris . 
Trump has said that a vaccine against the virus would be ready in record time , perhaps before the election , raising questions about whether political pressure might result in the deployment of a vaccine before it is safe . 
Harris had said she would not trust Trump with a vaccine before the election and Biden , critical of Trump ’s response to the virus , has urged Americans to heed the scientists . 
Critics accuse Trump of undermining scientists during the pandemic . 
Speaking in front of the White House at a US Labor Day news conference , Trump said : Biden and his very liberal running mate , the most liberal person in Congress by the way - is not a competent person in my opinion , would destroy this country and would destroy this economy - should immediately apologise for the reckless anti vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now . 
It undermines science . 
The president called Biden " stupid . " 
In rambling remarks the president also hailed the US labour market ’s recovery from the pandemic fuelled recession and suggested Biden would undo that progress . 
Trump has sought to paint himself as best placed to revive the economy , despite criticism that his initial dismissal of the virus threat led to both a health crisis as well as a recession .
