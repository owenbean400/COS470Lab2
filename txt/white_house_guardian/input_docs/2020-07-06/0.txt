The state of the epidemic in the US is " really not good " and a " serious situation that we have to address immediately " , the top White House health official Dr Anthony Fauci has said . 
The nation is still " knee deep " in the first wave , having never got the case number as low as planned , Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said during a live internet interview with National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins . 
It â€™s a serious situation that we have to address immediately . 
Fauci said that he expects an eventual vaccine , now in development by several companies , to work well and provide protection at least for some period of time , but that it will not be infinite protection such as the vaccine for measles .
