Novavax has said its experimental Covid 19 vaccine produced antibodies against the coronavirus and appears to be safe , according to initial data from a small , early stage clinical trial . 
The Maryland based biotechnology company said its vaccine candidate , NVX Co V2373 , produced higher levels of the antibodies in healthy volunteers after two doses than those found in recovered Covid 19 patients , raising hopes for its eventual success . 
The addition of its Matrix M adjuvant , a substance designed to boost the body ’s immune response , did enhance the effect of the vaccine in the study , the company said . 
The Novavax vaccine is among the first of a handful of programmes singled out for US funding under Operation Warp Speed , the White House programme to accelerate access to vaccines and treatments that can fight the virus . 
Novavax research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters the company will start much larger late stage clinical trials soon and could potentially glean enough data to obtain regulatory approvals as early as December . 
The US government in July agreed to pay Novavax $ 1.6bn to help cover costs related to testing and manufacturing the vaccine , with the aim of procuring 100m doses by January 2021 . 
The trial , which started in late May , tested the vaccine in 106 subjects aged 18 to 59 versus a placebo . 
The company said the second vaccination induced greater levels of side effects such as swelling and pain at the injection site , which are not considered serious , with only one participant experiencing fever . 
The Phase II portion of the study will be conducted in multiple countries , including the US . 
It will gauge the vaccine ’s ability to prevent infections or reduce severity of Covid 19 , in addition to safety and immune response , among a broader range of volunteers .
