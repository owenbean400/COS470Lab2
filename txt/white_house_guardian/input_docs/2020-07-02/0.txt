The leaders of some of the nation ’s major business organizations have signed a letter urging the White House and the National Governors Association to establish mandatory mask guidelines . 
Meanwhile , Texas governor Greg Abbott today issued an executive order requiring all Texans to wear a face mask in public spaces . 
Here ’s the announcement from Abbott ’s office : AUSTIN - Governor Greg Abbott today issued an Executive Order requiring all Texans to wear a face covering over the nose and mouth in public spaces in counties with 20 or more positive COVID 19 cases , with few exceptions . 
The Governor also issued a proclamation giving mayors and county judges the ability to impose restrictions on some outdoor gatherings of over 10 people , and making it mandatory that , with certain exceptions , people cannot be in groups larger than ten and must maintain six feet of social distancing from others . 
" Wearing a face covering in public is proven to be one of the most effective ways we have to slow the spread of COVID 19 , " said Governor Abbott . 
" We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck , but it requires each of us to do our part to protect one another—and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces . 
Likewise , large gatherings are a clear contributor to the rise in COVID 19 cases . 
Restricting the size of groups gatherings will strengthen Texas ’ ability to corral this virus and keep Texans safe . 
We all have a responsibility to slow the spread of COVID 19 and keep our communities safe . 
If Texans commit to wearing face coverings in public spaces and follow the best health and safety practices , we can both slow the spread of COVID 19 and keep Texas open for business . 
I urge all Texans to wear a face covering in public , not just for their own health , but for the health of their families , friends , and for all our fellow Texans . "
