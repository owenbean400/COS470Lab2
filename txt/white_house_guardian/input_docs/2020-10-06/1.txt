US president Donald Trump has played down the Covid 19 pandemic again , comparing it to the flu in a tweet on Tuesday , and Twitter has responded by putting a warning label on the tweet , saying the post included potentially misleading information . 
" Flu season is coming up ! 
Many people every year , sometimes over 100,000 , and despite the Vaccine , die from the Flu . 
Are we going to close down our Country ? 
No , we have learned to live with it , just like we are learning to live with Covid , in most populations far less lethal ! ! ! " 
Trump tweeted .

Earlier in the day , Facebook removed a similar post by Trump , according to CNN . 
The tweet comes hours after Trump was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland . 
On Monday , Trump told Americans " to get out there " and not fear Covid 19 as he returned to the White House after a three night hospital stay to be treated for the coronavirus , and removed his white surgical mask to pose for pictures . 
During the 2019-2020 influenza season , the flu was associated with 22,000 deaths , according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates .
