According to White House press pool reporters , the Donald Trump also called Dr Anthony Fauci ’s message yesterday cautioning against opening the economy too soon " unacceptable " . 
" I was surprised by his answer , " Trump said . 
" To me it ’s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools . " 
Pres Trump : The " only thing " that would be acceptable is teachers staying home a bit longer bc the coronavirus " attacks age."Dr . Fauci yesterday : " I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects . " 
Yesterday , the top public health official contradicted Trump , who urged schools and businesses to reopen and said the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by the autumn . 
Fauci disputed that timeline , indicating that neither a vaccine nor treatment could be developed and distributed in time to facilitate the reopening of schools in the fall . 
The president said : I think they should open the schools , absolutely . 
I think they should . 
It ’s had very little impact on young people . 
And I think that if you ’re an instructor , if you ’re a teacher , a professor over a certain age like let ’s say 65 or maybe even if you want to be conservative , 60 , perhaps you want to stay out for a little while longer . 
But I think you should absolutely open the schools . 
Our country has got to get back and it ’s got to get back as soon as possible , and I do not consider our country coming back if the schools are closed .
