In the UK , the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid 19 may have emerged via a leak from a research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan . 
Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago , told a webinar : I â€™m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is : It came via markets . 
There are all sorts of hypotheses around , but I just think it is not useful to speculate , worry about all that . 
The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease . 
In that case , he said , there " should be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that " . 
But , in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo , Parker concluded : Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful . 
Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence . 
British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they do not subscribe to the lab leak theory , although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK , US and Australia . 
Parker was speaking at a webinar organised by the Royal Society of Medicine .
