White House infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said his advice to people who want to attend US president Donald Trump ’s campaign rallies is the same for Black Lives Matter and anti Trump protestors . 
He said the gatherings are " a danger " and " risky . " 
Trump announced his campaign rallies are planned for 19 June , known as Juneteenth in the US , a holiday marking the end of slavery . 
Trump has insisted he did not choose the date on purpose . 
" The fact that I ’m having a rally on that day - you can really think about that very positively as a celebration , " Trump told Fox News . 
" Because a rally to me is a celebration . 
It ’s an interesting date . 
It was not done for that reason , but it ’s an interesting date . " 
President Trump wants to hold an offensive & amp ; blatantly unsafe indoor rally in Tulsa on Juneteenth . 
A rally requiring attendees to sign liability waivers b/c of the likelihood of contracting COVID.Well , I thought we should ask @ CDCDirector whether he thinks that 's a good idea .
