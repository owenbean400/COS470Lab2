Just dipping back into the Trump press conference at the White House , and the president has blame states for lack of supplies . 
" By the way , the states should have been building their stockpiles , " Trump said , reiterating that the federal government is " a backup . " 
States are to blame for not buying up supplies , and keeping them . 
" Ideally those states should have had the equipment , " he said . 
" We â€™re ( the federal government ) a back up not an ordering clerk "
