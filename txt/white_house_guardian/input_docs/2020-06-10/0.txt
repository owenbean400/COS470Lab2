There has been no sign yet of an increase in cases from two weeks of protests across the US , the country ’s vice president Mike Pence has claimed . 
He has told Fox Business Network : What I can tell you is that , at this point , we do not see an increase in new cases now , nearly two weeks on from when the first protests took effect . 
Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing . 
Dr Anthony Fauci , the top infectious disease expert on the White House task force Pence chairs , has expressed concern about the protests taking place during the pandemic . 
" When you get congregations like we saw with the demonstrations , that ’s taking a risk , " Fauci said on Wednesday in an interview on ABC . 
Last Friday , he said the mass protests were a " perfect setup " for spreading the virus .
