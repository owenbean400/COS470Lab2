In the US , the top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said he cannot not understand the effort by some in the White House to discredit him , calling it a mistake . 
In an interview with The Atlantic , he has said : You know , it is a bit bizarre . 
I do not really fully understand it . 
I think if you talk to reasonable people in the White House they realise that was a major mistake on their part because it does not do anything but reflect poorly on them . 
And I do not think that was their intention .
