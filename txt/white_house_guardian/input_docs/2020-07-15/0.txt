The US president Donald Trump has issued a rare rebuke of his senior adviser Peter Navarro , saying he should not have written the scathing USA Today opinion piece about Dr Fauci . 
Navarro , a trade adviser who at times has expanded his reach within the Trump White House , wrote : Dr Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public , but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on . 
The initial lack of a pushback from the White House for the article fed a belief that Navarro ’s article was supported at the top levels of the White House . 
But , departing for a trip to Atlanta , Trump was asked whether Navarro had gone rogue . 
Well , he made a statement representing himself . 
He should not be doing that . 
No , I have a very good relationship with Anthony . 
A White House official told Reuters that Trump did not endorse Navarro ’s article and that Navarro was told " explicitly in recent days to de escalate the situation " . 
The official said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows felt Navarro ’s article was " unacceptable " .
