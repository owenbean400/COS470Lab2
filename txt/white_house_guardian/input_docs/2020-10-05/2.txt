And a reminder that , according to Vanity Fair â€™s Gabriel Sherman , Trump chose to leave the White House for Walter Reed because it was important that he be seen walking to Marine Force One : Per source , Trump was told on Friday he could go to Walter Reed voluntarily , but he would be taken no matter what when his condition worsened . 
Doctors told Trump if he waited he could lose ability to walk to Marine One ( optics of a wheelchair or stretcher obvs would be terrible )
