The US and other countries could have had a stronger initial response to Covid 19 if China had been more forthcoming about key features of the virus , the White House task force response coordinator Dr Deborah Birx has said . 
At a panel held by the Atlantic Council , a US think tank , Birx said the United States would have been more focused on identifying asymptomatic patients if China has shared relevant information . 
I have to say if we had known about the level of asymptomatic spread , we would have all looked at this differently . 
That ’s usually the initial countries ’ responsibility ... and I think that did delay across the board our ability to really see or look for this . 
Birx said that public health officials had originally assumed that only 15 to 20 % of patients are asymptomatic when in fact that number is thought to be at least 40 % . 
We were looking for people with symptoms . 
We should have looked for anyone who would have been exposed . 
The US president Donald Trump has levelled blame at China for the outbreak , saying the country should have warned the world much sooner . 
Birx added that the recent uptick in US cases has been worsened by high rates of transmission among people between 18 and 35 . 
This is an age group that was so good and so disciplined in March and April , but when they saw people out and about on social media they all went out and about . 
The United States saw a 27 % increase in new cases in the week ended 5 July , compared with the previous seven days .
