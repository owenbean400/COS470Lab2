Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House â€™s Coronavirus Response Coordinator , is speaking now . 
She says there has been a decline in the rate of new cases . 
There are nine states with fewer than 30 new cases per day . 
California and Washington State " never really had a peak " because of the hard work that was done by people there to self isolate , she says . 
Speaking more generally : There are those of you who might just want to " have that dinner party for 20 " she says . 
Do not do it . 
There are states with very few cases , which have been relatively " silent " throughout the pandemic , says Dr Birx , and these are the ones President Trump is speaking about when he says some states may open before 1 May .
