US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said talks with the White House on a coronavirus aid bill were far from a deal on Friday , as federal unemployment benefits that have been an essential lifeline for millions of Americans expired . 
Asked why she rejected a proposal from Republican President Donald Trump ’s administration for a one week extension of the $ 600 weekly jobless payment , Pelosi told reporters a short term fix would be appropriate " if you are on a path " toward a deal . 
" We ’re not , " Pelosi told a news conference . 
Negotiations were to continue on Saturday between White House officials and congressional Democrats , Reuters reported . 
Pelosi will host a meeting with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows , an aide familiar with the planning said . 
Pelosi , the nation ’s top elected Democrat , said she thought Congress and the White House eventually would come together on legislation , although she gave no timetable . 
Referring to the mounting cases and deaths from COVID 19 , Pelosi said : " This is a freight train that is picking up steam . ... 
It must be stopped . " 
In some of her toughest criticisms so far , she said that Republican delays on legislation and " distortions " about the pandemic " has caused death unnecessarily . " 
White House officials took their own hard partisan line , accusing Democrats of refusing Trump ’s proposals to extend the jobless benefit that expired on Friday and a moratorium on evictions that ended last week .
