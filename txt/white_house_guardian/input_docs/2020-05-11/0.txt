Donald Trump has been taking questions at his White House briefing . 
The first was about the White House staff who tested positive . 
" I do not think the system broke down at all , " he said . 
He said the person who tested positive " will be fine " and will be " out of quarantine very soon " . 
He says it is " shocking " , given the number of people who come in and out of the White House every day , how few positive cases there have been . 
He adds : " I ’ve felt no vulnerability whatsoever . " 
Asked when Americans can get tested every day like his senior staff can , Trump said it would be " very soon " . 
" We ’re leaving that up to the governors , " Trump said when asked how Americans should feel about going back to work without more testing capacity . 
He then argued that some governors are being too slow to lift their restrictions . 
Trump said it was his decision to require West Wing staffers to begin wearing masks .
