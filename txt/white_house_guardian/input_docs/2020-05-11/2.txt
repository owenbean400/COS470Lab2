Here ’s the PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor on how the ending to Trump ’s briefing played out : Why did Trump end WH briefing ? 
@ weijia asked Trump why he sees this as " a global competition " when 80K have died . 
He said : " Ask China . " 
He tried to move on but would not let @ kaitlancollins ask her Q . He called on me but I motioned for Kaitlin to ask her Q so Trump walked off .
