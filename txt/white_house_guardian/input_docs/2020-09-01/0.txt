The White House has pushed back on concerns expressed by the World Health Organization after a US health official said a coronavirus vaccine might be approved without completing full trials . 
White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement : The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus , but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China . 
This President will spare no expense to ensure that any new vaccine maintains our own FDA â€™s gold standard for safety and efficacy , is thoroughly tested , and saves lives .
