The top US health official Dr Anthony Fauci will be prevented from testifying to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration â€™s response to the pandemic next week , the White House has said . 
The Trump administration claimed it would be " counterproductive " to have individuals involved in the response testify . 
The White House spokesman Judd Deere told Reuters : While the Trump administration continues its whole of government response to Covid 19 , including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development , it is counter productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings . 
We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time .
