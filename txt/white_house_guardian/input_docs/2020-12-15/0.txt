The US president , Donald Trump , will " absolutely " encourage Americans to take Covid 19 vaccines and will receive a vaccine himself as soon as his medical team determines it â€™s best , the White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany has said . 
But the Republican president also wanted to show that vulnerable Americans are the top priority to receive the vaccines , she told reporters at a White House briefing . 
Mc Enany said some career national security staff would have access to vaccines to ensure a continuity of government , along with a " very small group " of senior administration officials for the purpose of instilling public confidence .
