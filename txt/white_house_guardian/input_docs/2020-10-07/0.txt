At least 27 people across Donald Trump ’s White House , election campaign and military leaders have now tested positive for coronavirus . 
On Tuesday , Stephen Miller , the controversial policy adviser to the US president , became the latest to confirm that he has Covid 19 and will enter quarantine . 
Miller has become the latest in a lengthy list of people connected to the White House to contract the virus in recent days . 
This group is headed by Trump himself , who left the Walter Reed hospital on Monday after receiving state of the art medical treatment for the virus . 
Trump , who has routinely downplayed the virus and disparaged the wearing of masks , posed for cameras without a mask after returning to the White House and tweeted : " Do not be afraid of Covid . 
Do not let it dominate your life . " 
Public health experts have criticised Trump ’s comments , noting that people with the virus can still spread it to others for around 10 days after becoming infected .
