Dr Anthony Fauci , the top US government official on infectious diseases , expects drug manufacturers will have tens of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses at the start of 2021 . 
Speaking in a Reuters interview , he said production would likely ramp up so that it hits a billion doses by the end of 2021 . 
Fauci said he has not seen any pressure from the White House to announce a vaccine close to the 3 November election , in the hopes of boosting President Donald Trump â€™s re election chances . 
He added that regulators have promised " they are not going to let political considerations interfere " with the approval of a Covid 19 vaccine and " safety and efficacy " will be primary considerations .
