The White House and Democrats in the US congress have moved closer to agreement on a new coronavirus relief package , as president Donald Trump said he was willing to accept a large aid bill despite opposition from his own Republican party . 
With just two weeks to go until the US presidential election , Trump signaled a willingness to go along with more than $ 2.2tn in new Covid 19 relief , as Democrats had been pushing for months . 
" I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats , " Trump said in an interview with Fox News , as talks between Democrat Nancy Pelosi and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin continued with the goal of getting something to pass Congress before 3 November . 
Pelosi , speaking to reporters after a mid afternoon call with Mnuchin , was asked about prospects for a legislative package by the end of this week . 
" I hope so . 
That ’s the plan , " she said . 
The White House has proposed $ 1.8tn in coronavirus relief , while Pelosi is pushing for $ 2.2tn . Earlier on Tuesday , Pelosi told Bloomberg TV : " I ’m optimistic , because I do think we have ... a shared value that finally they want to crush the virus . 
Hopefully by the end of the day today , we ’ll know where we all are . "
