A leading US Republican senator has proposed legislation that would authorise the White House to impose far reaching sanctions on China if it fails to give a full account of events leading to the pandemic . 
Senator Lindsey Graham , a close ally of Donald Trump , said he is convinced had it not been for " deception " by the ruling Chinese Communist Party , the virus would not be in the United States , where it has now killed more than 80,000 Americans . 
Graham said China had refused to allow investigators to study how the outbreak started . 
I â€™m convinced China will never cooperate with a serious investigation unless they are made to do so . 
Graham said his " Covid 19 Accountability Act " would require the president to make a certification to Congress within 60 days that China had " provided a full and complete accounting to any Covid 19 investigation led by the United States , its allies or UN affiliate such as the World Health Organization " . 
Trump critics , including some former officials , have said that while China has much to answer for , the US administration appears to be seeking to deflect attention from what they see as a slow response to the crisis .
