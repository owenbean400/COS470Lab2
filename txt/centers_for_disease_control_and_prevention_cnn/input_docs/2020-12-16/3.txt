Gen . Gustave F . Perna , the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed , said they discovered two trays carrying Pfizer vaccines were not at the recommended temperature needed for storage and had to send them back to Pfizer . 
" We locked those trays down , Pfizer and OWS working with Fed Ex and UPS , they never left the truck . 
And we returned them immediately back to Pfizer and we sent immediate shipments to replace those two trays , " Perna added . 
Perna also said that they saw the same situation in Alabama , where two trays were at minus 92 degrees Celsius , and like in California , they were able to stop delivery of trays and get a second shipment immediately to the state . 
Additionally , Perna said that they are working with the FDA , CDC and Pfizer to determine if that anomaly is safe or not .
