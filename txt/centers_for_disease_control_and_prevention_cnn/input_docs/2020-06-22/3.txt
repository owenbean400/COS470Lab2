A new study suggests that as many as 8.7 million Americans came down with coronavirus in March but that 80 % of them were never diagnosed . 
A team of researchers looked at the number of people who went to doctors or clinics with influenza like illnesses that were never diagnosed as coronavirus , influenza or any of the other viruses that usually circulate in winter . 
There was a giant spike in these cases in March , the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine . 
Only 100,000 cases were officially reported during that time period , and the US still reports only 2.3 million cases as of Monday . 
But there was a shortage of coronavirus testing kits at the time . 
The team used data collected from each state by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for influenza like illness . 
The CDC uses this data to track the annual seasonal flu epidemic . 
" We found a clear , anomalous surge in influenza like illness ( ILI ) outpatients during the COVID 19 epidemic that correlated with the progression of the epidemic in multiple states across the US , " Silverman and colleagues wrote . 
" The surge of non influenza ILI outpatients was much larger than the number of confirmed case in each state , providing evidence of large numbers of probable symptomatic COVID 19 cases that remained undetected . "
