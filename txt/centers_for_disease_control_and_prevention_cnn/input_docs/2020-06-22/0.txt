The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been conducting a scientific review about the public health benefits of masks , and will soon make an updated recommendation , a senior CDC official told CNN . 
The reviews are happening even though the CDC has already published guidance on its website . 
A senior official with knowledge of the review said science is being studied as to whether masks are not only " good for source control -- and keeping you from giving it to others -- but we â€™re also seeing if masks are going to protect you from getting ( Covid 19 ) yourself . " 
The CDC website has two separate pages of guidance on face coverings . 
One recommends people wear masks when they leave their home . 
The other recommends people wear a mask if they cannot properly social distance . 
An official at the agency says recommendations from a final scientific review by its incident management " will happen soon . "
