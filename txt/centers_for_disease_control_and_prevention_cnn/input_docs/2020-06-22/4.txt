The former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr . Richard Besser , expressed concern that cases of Covid 19 will start rising again as certain locations begin to gradually open up — because public health measures meant to control infection are not quite up to speed . 
Besser ’s comments come at a moment when New York City , Washington , DC , and the state of New Jersey enter phase two of reopening . 
They also coincide with the latest numbers that show 23 states have rising infection rates . 
" Because as you reopen … you expect to see more cases . 
But what we 're hearing , in terms of the public health model — of testing people , through contact tracing , and then isolation and quarantine — it does not sound like it 's working as well as it really needs to , " Besser said . 
He said we 're not providing the services that people need to be able to isolate and quarantine safely . 
Besser served as acting director of the CDC for the first half of 2009 . 
He is now president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
