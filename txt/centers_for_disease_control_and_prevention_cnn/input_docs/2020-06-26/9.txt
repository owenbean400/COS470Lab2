The US needs to start considering " flooding the system with testing " in light of new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting that for every person infected with Covid 19 , 10 more people in the country go undiagnosed , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Friday . 
Speaking during a pre recorded interview with CNBC , Fauci called the CDC 's findings " sobering news . " 
Fauci said contact tracing was not going well ⁠— with some exceptions ⁠— and argued for pool testing over individual identification , particularly in areas where people do not want to cooperate with contact tracing efforts . 
" Instead of I test me , and I test you ... you could take 20 , 30 , 40 pool them , do one test . 
If they 're all negative , then you know that that 's negative . 
You now have 40 people who are negative . 
If you get a positive , then you backtrack and try and figure out who that positive is , " Fauci said .
