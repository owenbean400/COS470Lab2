The US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has expanded its list of those most at risk of becoming severely ill from coronavirus , warning that a substantial number of people are vulnerable . 
The agency previously said that people aged over 65 years and older were at high risk of severe illness . 
On Thursday the CDC removed the age classification , saying that risk increased as people aged . 
" [ The ] CDC now warns that among adults , risk increases steadily as you age , and it ’s not just those over the age of 65 who are at increased risk for severe illness , " the agency said in a statement . 
The agency added that while age remained an independent risk factor for severe illness , the threat faced by older adults was also due to the group being more likely than younger people to have underlying heatlh conditions . 
" Understanding who is most at risk for severe illness helps people make the best decisions for themselves , their families , and their communities , " said CDC Director Robert Redfield . 
" While we are all at risk for Covid 19 , we need to be aware of who is susceptible to severe complications so that we take appropriate measures to protect their health and well being . " 
The CDC also updated its list of underlying conditions which increase the risk of severe illness . 
The conditions are : Chronic kidney disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Obesity ( BMI of 30 or higher ) Immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant Serious heart conditions , such as heart failure , coronary artery disease , or cardiomyopathies Sickle cell disease Type 2 diabetes The expanded list and the change to the age classification increases the number of people in high risk groups . 
" As more information becomes available , it is clear that a substantial number of Americans are at increased risk of severe illness – highlighting the importance of continuing to follow preventive measures , " the CDC said .
