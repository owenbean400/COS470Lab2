Emergency physician Leana Wen joined CNN 's ongoing coronavirus town hall to answer questions from viewers on the disease , which has seen alarming spikes in the US this week . 
What does the CDC 's new guidance mean ? 
Today , the CDC updated its list of people who are most at risk of severe complications from coronavirus . 
The list includes people with severe kidney disease , lung disease , heart disease , and obesity . 
Obesity is a major one , since 40 % of Americans fall under that category , said Wen . 
Pregnant women are now also on the list , and should consider themselves " medically vulnerable , " she said . 
Has the danger of infection via touching things declined ? 
The most likely way you might get infected is through person to person contact , like being next to someone who is sneezing or talking . 
But there is still a risk of getting Covid 19 from surfaces , especially surfaces that are touched frequently by many people , said Wen â€” meaning it 's still crucial to keep washing your hands and being careful what you touch .
