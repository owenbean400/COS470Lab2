Texas reported its highest daily jump in coronavirus cases on Thursday , with just under 6,000 new infections . 
The spike could be a precursor of things to come , warned Dr . Richard Besser , the former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 
" The situation in Texas is a warning shot for the situation that could occur in any state where this is not being taken seriously enough , " Besser told CNN . 
Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott announced he is pausing the state ’s reopening plans , and asked people to stay at home . 
" What we 're seeing in Texas is a healthcare system that is in many places on the verge of getting overwhelmed , and we know what that looks like from what happened in New York City . 
Hopefully the actions that are being taken now , are not too little too late , " Besser said . 
A " super spreader event " : A surprise birthday party in northern Texas late last month is now being linked to at least 18 cases of coronavirus . 
Besser said it ’s another warning that people need to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public . 
" These kind of events are what are called super spreader events where , for some reasons that are unknown , a lot of cases occur from the exposure to one or two people . 
But it 's a sign that we have to take this seriously , " he said .
