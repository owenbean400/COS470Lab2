Vice President Mike Pence said that while it is " encouraging news " that new cases of coronavirus are increasingly among young Americans , young people also " have a particular responsibility " to ensure they 're not spreading the virus to vulnerable populations . 
Pence said about half of news cases among people under the age of 35 , " which is at a certain level , very encouraging news , as the experts tell us . " 
Pence said . 
Yesterday , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the pandemic has moved into younger populations â€” a change that could mean less serious illness and lower rates of death . 
" As we know , so far in this pandemic , younger Americans are less susceptible to serious outcomes of the coronavirus , " Pence said at an ongoing coronavirus task force briefing . 
However , Pence added that young Americans must be careful to not spread the virus to older or more vulnerable people . 
The risk of serious complications and death rises with age , the CDC says , although there 's no clear age cutoff for higher or lower risk . 
People with diabetes , kidney disease , moderate to severe asthma , and obesity are also at higher risk .
