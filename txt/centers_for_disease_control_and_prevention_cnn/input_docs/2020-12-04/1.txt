Masks are " critical " in controlling the spread of coronavirus — and that includes at home sometimes , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday . 
A CDC review of what works makes it clear that mask use , physical distancing , avoiding crowds and washing hands all could help control the spread of the virus – and would allow kids to go back to school and businesses to reopen . 
" Consistent and correct use of face masks is a public health strategy critical to reducing respiratory transmission of SARS Co V 2 , particularly in light of estimates that approximately one half of new infections are transmitted by persons who have no symptoms , " the CDC summary of guidance reads . 
The CDC has gradually been strengthening its recommendations on mask use . 
" Compelling evidence now supports the benefits of cloth face masks for both source control ( to protect others ) and , to a lesser extent , protection of the wearer , " the team wrote . 
Masks work so well that certain communities should consider giving them out , the CDC team said . 
" A community level plan for distribution of face masks to specific populations , such as those who might experience barriers to access , should be developed , " the CDC team wrote in the agency ’s weekly report . 
Physical distancing is also important . 
" Although the impact of physical distancing is difficult to disaggregate from other interventions , one study estimated that physical distancing decreased the average number of daily contacts by as much as 74 % , " they added . 
Consistent physical distancing could stop the spread , the CDC said .
