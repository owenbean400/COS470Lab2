An administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said today that any costs associated with the coronavirus test would be covered by Medicare and Medicaid . 
Seema Verma 's remarks followed an announcement by Vice President Mike Pence Tuesday evening saying that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would issue new guidance that " any American can be tested ( for coronavirus ) , no restrictions , subject to doctors ’ orders . " 
Asked by CNN if the testing would be free and what would be done to help those who could not afford it , Pence said guidance was going to be sent out immediately that notes that Medicare and Medicaid covers the test . 
Verma noted that it is a diagnostic test so it would be covered under insurance as an essential health benefit and is a covered service in the exchanges — in Medicaid and in Medicare . 
CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield added that the test the CDC provides to the public health community is provided free of charge to public health labs across the country . 
Pence said that there was concern that some people felt they could not be tested if they were only mildly symptomatic , but the new guidance will make clear " that any clinician or health authority can administer the test . "
