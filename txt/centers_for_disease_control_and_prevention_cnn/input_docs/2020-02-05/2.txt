The US 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) will distribute 200 test kits for Wuhan coronavirus to domestic labs , and another 200 test kits to international labs . 
Each test kit can perform 700-800 patient samples . 
This will allow for enhanced capacity for testing by early next week , Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , told reporters Wednesday . 
Messonnier said she expected these kits will result in states announcing their own confirmed cases , rather than waiting for confirmation from the CDC . 
Previously , the CDC was the only lab in the United States capable of testing for the novel coronavirus . 
The diagnostic is authorized to be used for patients who meet CDC criteria for testing , and by qualified labs designated by the CDC or certified to perform high complexity tests . 
It ’s known as a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test and can detect Wuhan coronavirus from nasal or oral swabs . 
Negative results do not preclude infection with the virus , the FDA noted in a press release , adding that negative results must be combined with clinical observations , patient history and epidemiological information . 
As of Wednesday , the CDC has listed 293 people under investigation for the novel coronavirus in 36 states . 
Of those , 11 have tested positive , 206 negative and 76 are still pending . 
These numbers are cumulative since January 21 . 
Six cases have been confirmed in California , one in Massachusetts , one in Washington state , one in Arizona and two in Illinois . 
This includes two instances of known person to person transmission , one in Illinois and one in California .
