US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield on Wednesday warned that the next few months are going to be rough , as the number of Covid 19 cases spike across the country . 
Redfield says this is because as of today , 90 % of the hospitals in this country are in the " red zone . " 
" Ninety percent of our hospitals in this nation are actually in what we call one of the hot zones in the red zone â€“ therefore at risk for increased hospitalization and potential to negatively impact hospital capacity , " Redfield said . 
" Ninety percent of all of our long term care facilities are in what we call high transmission zones , so , we are at a very critical time right now about being able to maintain the resilience of our health care system . "
