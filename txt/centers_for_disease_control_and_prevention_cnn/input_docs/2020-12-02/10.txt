Dr . Kelly Moore , associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition , which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid 19 vaccinations , said vaccination cards will be used as the " simplest " way to keep track of Covid 19 shots . 
Claire Hannan , executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers , which is helping states with their immunization plans , said vaccination clinics will also be reporting to their state immunization registries what vaccine was given . 
For example , if an entity did not know where a patient got a first dose , they could run a query . 
" If you 're in the same state , they can query the information system , " Hannan said . 
On top of that , Moore said many places are planning to ask patients to voluntarily provide a cell phone number , so they can get a text message telling them when and where their next dose is scheduled to be administered . 
Hannan said many states are also providing consumer access to records . 
" So your record that 's in the immunization information system , you would have a way to access , so you could check . 
And if you went and showed up somewhere different to get a second dose , you would be able to find out what your first dose was , " she said . 
Hannan said every dose administered is being reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as well . 
The CDC did not immediately respond to CNN 's inquiry about whether such a database would include a record of everyone immunized .
