Mitigation strategies , such as mask wearing , social distancing , and good hand hygiene , in addition to weekly screening and contact tracing , helped dissolve outbreaks on college campuses , according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention â€™s Dr . Robert Redfield . 
The CDC director expressed his initial concerns that college students would be problematic in containing the number of infections . 
In August , colleges and universities across the US reported more the 8,700 cases in 36 states . 
Several outbreaks were reported due to private gatherings and parties among students . 
Some institutions implemented screening procedures to identify asymptomatic carriers and isolated those individuals to prevent transmission , according to Redfield . 
" It reaffirms to me that mitigation can work , " Redfield said . 
" The idea that coupling mitigation with routine screening surveillance , to be able to identify the asymptomatic carriers these techniques do work . "
