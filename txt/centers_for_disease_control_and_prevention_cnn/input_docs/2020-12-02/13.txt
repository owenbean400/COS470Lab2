Dr . Henry Walke , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Covid 19 incident manager , said that as Americans continue through the holiday season , they should avoid travel and stay home . 
" We ’re happy we ’re coming out with this guidance now before the holiday season to provide additional consideration for the American public and health care providers , public health administrators to think through in terms of preventing infection , " Walke said Wednesday . 
The reason for the recommendation to avoid travel is that cases are rising and hospitalizations and deaths are both increasing , Walke said . 
" We need to try to bend the curve , stop this exponential increase and so we ’re really asking the American public to prevent these infections and avoid travel and wash their hands , wear a mask and maintain distance , " Walke said .
