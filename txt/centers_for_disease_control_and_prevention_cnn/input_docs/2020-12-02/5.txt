The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hopes that more people might be willing to complete Covid 19 quarantine if the time period is reduced from 14 days – and that may result in fewer coronavirus infections , Dr . John Brooks , chief medical officer for the CDC ’s Covid 19 response , said during a telebriefing on Wednesday . 
There is some risk a person who has left quarantine before 14 days could transmit the virus to others . 
The decision to change quarantine guidance came after " extensive " modeling by the CDC and other agencies that showed the risk of low , Brooks said . 
" We can safely reduce the length of quarantine , but accepting there is a small residual risk that a person who is leaving quarantine early could transmit to someone else if they became infectious , " Brooks said . 
If a person quarantined for 10 days and had no symptoms and no test , the residual risk of transmitting coronavirus to someone else after quarantine is estimated to be about 1 % , with an upper limit of about 10 % , the CDC said on its website . 
If a person quarantined for seven days and had no symptoms and a negative test , the risk of transmitting coronavirus is about 5 % , with an upper limit of about 12 % . 
A test should be collected within 48 hours before quarantine intends to end , and quarantine should not end before seven days , even if rest results are returned earlier . 
If a person who ended quarantine early goes on to develop symptoms within 14 days , they should contact their local health authority and health care provider , seek out testing and isolate . 
Correction : An earlier version of this story included a quote with incorrect percentages on risks after quarantine . 
The risk after a seven day quarantine , among other requirements , is about 5 % , with an upper limit of about 12 % .
