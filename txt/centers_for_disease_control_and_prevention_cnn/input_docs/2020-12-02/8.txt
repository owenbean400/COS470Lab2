Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that as he approaches the end of his term at the CDC in January , he has realized that the United States was not prepared for a pandemic , and more investment is needed . 
He added that the US had not invested enough in data analytics , laboratory resilience to ensure the public health capacity had multiple platforms , or the public health workforce . 
" I had some states that their public health contact tracing workforce was less than 50 people , so there 's a huge lack of investment , which I hope this pandemic will change that , " Redfield added .
