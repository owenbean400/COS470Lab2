Certain occupations and subgroups could benefit from a vaccine mandate , according to Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
During a livestream event with US Chamber of Commerce Foundation on Wednesday , Redfield said he can see the likelihood of health care , long term care facility and airline personnel requiring proof of immunization for staff and consumers . 
Although the decision is up to institutions , mandating a vaccine for certain occupations could prevent reintroducing the virus . 
" Even though we get control of Covid … the pandemic and the world is not going to controlled for multiple years , and so we ’ll always have a global risk of reintroduction through susceptibles if they have not been vaccinated . "
