The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends postponing travel over the upcoming winter holidays for people to keep themselves and their families as safe as possible . 
" CDC recommends that the best way to protect yourself and others is to postpone travel and stay home , " said Dr . Henry Walke , the CDC â€™s Covid 19 incident manager , during a news briefing on Wednesday . 
If people do decide to travel , " CDC recommends that travelers consider getting tested one to three days before travel , " Walke said . 
" And then again three to five days after travel . " 
This should be combined with reducing non essential activities for a full seven days after travel , he said . 
For those who do not get tested after travelling , CDC recommends that non essential activities are reduced for ten days . 
Walke said if Covid 19 symptoms are experienced at any point during or after travelling , people should follow CDC or local guidance about what to do if a person gets sick .
