US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director , Dr . Robert Redfield said that we could see more than 400,000 Covid 19 deaths before February . 
However , Redfield says that if the American public embraces social distancing , wears masks , limits gatherings and continues to follow hygiene rules currently in place , those numbers could be decreased . 
" I think my disappointment at one thing , during my time as the CDC director during this pandemic , was that there was an inconsistency of the American public embracing the message , mask wearing . 
This mask wearing , it 's not a political decision , this is a public health tool , very powerful , very simple , but very powerful , " Redfield said .
