It was an easy choice to prioritize health care workers for any coronavirus vaccine that might get authorized , one of the vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday . 
" The decision for health care personnel to be in the first group to receive vaccine , I think was a relatively easy decision for me and the rest of the members of the committee , " Dr . Robert Atmar , a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine , told CNN 's Erin Burnett . 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to place health care workers and residents of long term care facilities first in the queue for any authorized Covid 19 vaccine . 
" What was a little bit more difficult for me was the decision on residents of long term care facilities . 
Certainly , this is the group that suffers the greatest burden of disease -- 40 % of deaths in the US have been among persons in long term care facilities . 
And I think that information persuaded me to add them to the list of the initial group to receive the vaccine , " he added . 
The vaccine candidates : Two companies have already applied for emergency use authorization for coronavirus vaccines . 
But there will still only be 40 million vaccines available by the end of December , even if both get immediate go ahead from the FDA . 
So ACIP will have to make choices about which populations to prioritize . 
Each vaccine requires two doses , so 40 million shots will cover 20 million people . 
There are 21 million healthcare workers in the US . 
The next few groups that may be prioritized include essential workers like firefighters , teachers , and then high risk people with underlying conditions , said Atmar .
