New guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control on Wednesday says quarantine periods can be shorter than 14 days for some people exposed to Covid 19 . 
The CDC continues to recommend quarantining for 14 days as the best way to reduce the risk of spreading Covid 19 , Dr . Henry Walke , who serves as the agency 's Covid 19 incident manager , said during a telebriefing . 
But Walke said there are " two acceptable alternative " quarantine periods : Quarantine can end after 10 days without a Covid 19 test if the person reported no symptoms , or after seven days with a negative test result if the person has reported no symptoms . 
People who have been exposed should still watch for symptoms for 14 days , especially if they end quarantine earlier , Walke said . 
Reducing the length may make it easier for people to quarantine , Walke said , and lessen stress on the public health system as new infections are rising quickly .
