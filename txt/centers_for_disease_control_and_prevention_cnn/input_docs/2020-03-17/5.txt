The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its website Tuesday to add information for pregnant health care professionals about the novel coronavirus and to post tips for disinfecting homes where people are sick with the virus . 
The CDC said pregnant health care personnel should follow the same risk assessment and infection control guidelines around coronavirus patients as other health care workers , but the agency also said it does not have information on adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with COVID 19 . 
The agency also added new information on its website on about disinfecting the home if someone is sick . 
The guidance says to wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect , and urges cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces , such as tables , countertops , light switches , doorknobs and cabinet handles every day .
