There are many aspects of the virus that remain unknown for scientists but older viruses offer some clues . 
People usually get infected by four common coronaviruses that were first identified in the mid 1960s , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
And those tend to peak in the winter months . 
Dr . Greg Poland , a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic , said that SARS Co V 2 , the technical name for the novel coronavirus that causes Covid 19 , is likely to follow that pattern . 
If that happens , a second wave of the virus would return just in time for the start of flu season . 
The flu has been a constant threat for Americans and devastating in recent years . 
The CDC estimates there were at least 39 million cases of the flu in the US and at least 24,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 season . 
Poland , the director of the Mayo Clinic 's Vaccine Research Group , says the combination of a second wave of Covid 19 with flu season could create " a lot of confusion " because of their overlap in symptoms and put a heavy strain on the health care system . 
It would not be the first pandemic to come back in force . 
In 2009 , the US experienced a wave of cases of the H1N1 influenza virus , known as swine flu , in the spring . 
Months later , a second wave was reported in the fall and winter , the CDC says . 
The 1918 influenza pandemic , which killed 50 million people globally and about 675,000 Americans , appeared as an initial mild spring wave in the US before a lethal second wave hit the country in September .
