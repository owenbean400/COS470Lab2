It 's a popular argument heard at protests denouncing state shutdowns , fueled by those who say news outlets are overreacting to coronavirus : The flu kills more people than coronavirus . 
Why shut down the economy for this ? 
Here are several reasons why coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu -- and why extra precautions are needed : Coronavirus is much more contagious . 
A person with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people . 
A person with novel coronavirus infects an average of about 2 to 3 other people . 
Coronavirus has killed at a much faster rate . 
Between October 2019 to early April 2020 , the flu killed up to 331 people a day , according to the preliminary CDC numbers . 
From February 6 through April 30 , the coronavirus killed an average of more than 739 people per day in the US . 
Coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms . 
With the flu , people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection , with symptoms often showing up within two days , the CDC says . 
That means people will know they 're sick fairly soon and will likely stay home . 
But with coronavirus , symptoms typically appear four or five days after exposure , and the incubation lasts up to 14 days . 
You can get a flu vaccine but not a coronavirus vaccine . 
Unlike the flu , there 's no option to get a vaccine for the coronavirus to protect against infection or to reduce the severity of symptoms . 
At the earliest , it 'll be months before a coronavirus vaccine might become publicly available .
