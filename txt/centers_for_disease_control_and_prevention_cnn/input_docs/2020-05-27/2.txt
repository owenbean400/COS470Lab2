Thousands of American doctors and nurses have gotten sick caring for Covid 19 patients , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday . 
Of an estimated 62,344 health care professionals who have contracted the disease , at least 291 have died , said the CDC . 
And these numbers are likely higher in reality , since the agency only has death status data for a little over half of cases it has information on . 
Many reports on cases also do not include whether the person worked in health care , meaning there are probably cases left out of this count . 
The last time the CDC highlighted the number of cases among health care workers was on April 15 . 
At that time , the number of infected health care workers was 9,282 -- a fraction of what it is now . 
Health care workers around the country have also complained for months that they do not have enough access to protective equipment .
