New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy , appearing on ABC 's " This Week , " said the travel advisory for New Jersey , Connecticut and New York was " de facto happening already . " 
He was referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuing a travel advisory urging people in New York , New Jersey and Connecticut to " refrain from non essential domestic travel " for the next two weeks . 
" The fact of the matter is , people really are not traveling a whole lot . 
A travel warning , we 're fine with , " Murphy said . 
New Jersey has a little more than 11,000 positive cases of coronavirus and 140 dead due to the virus as of Saturday , Murphy said . 
He added the state has yet to see how the dramatic steps they 've taken on social distancing will affect those numbers . 
New Jersey has received 120,000 N95 masks and 1,000 medical beds in supplies , but Murphy says the state is " still way short . " 
" The big headline for us right now are ventilators . 
We had a very specific conversation with the White House last night about ventilators , " Murphy said .
