Vaccine hesitancy is now the biggest challenge remaining in the fight against Covid 19 , Dr . Susan Bailey , president of the American Medical Association , said in a statement Saturday . 
CDC advisers voted to recommend the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine in the US Saturday . 
While the AMA looks forward to the CDC director reviewing and approving the recommendation , Bailey said that the hard work is far from over . 
" Manufacturing , distribution , and administration still pose challenges , but the biggest threat remaining may be people ’s willingness to get vaccinated , " she said . 
" To be clear , these vaccines will reduce death and severe illness . 
They have been rigorously evaluated , and if enough of us roll up our sleeves and get vaccinated , we can eventually reclaim normalcy . " 
Dr . Megan Ranney , a CNN medical analyst and Brown University emergency physician , is scheduled to receive the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine next Thursday . 
The potential side effects of the vaccination are not a deterrent , according to Ranney . 
" I have really zero reservations about being one of the first people , " Ranney told CNN ’s Ana Cabrera on Saturday . 
" I 'm willing to take those minor side effects to avoid having Covid , which I 've seen at this point in thousands of people . 
It is a horrible disease , " she said . 
" I will take a little low grade fever over having Covid . " 
The authorization of the vaccine is cause for optimism , Ranney added . 
" Throughout this pandemic , we 've heard a lot of claims of magical cures , whether it was hydroxychloroquine or bleach or just , ‘ This virus is going to magically disappear , ’ " she said . 
" Well , the vaccine is the real deal . "
