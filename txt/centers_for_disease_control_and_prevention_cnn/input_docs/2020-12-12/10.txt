Because there ’s limited information about how well the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine works in the general population , vaccinated people should continue to follow all the current guidelines about how to protect themselves and others , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Advisory Community on Immunization Practices was told during a meeting on Saturday . 
That guidance includes wearing masks , staying 6 feet away from others , avoiding crowds and washing hands frequently . 
The CDC ’s Dr . Sarah Mbaeyi said information is currently limited on how much the vaccine may reduce disease severity or transmission , and how long protection lasts . 
Mbaeyi noted during the presentation that protection from the two dose series of vaccine is not immediate , and no vaccine is 100 % effective .
