Data from clinical trials suggest the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine is safe and likely effective in people who were previously infected with the coronavirus , and vaccination should be offered to them , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Advisory Community on Immunization Practices was told during a meeting on Saturday . 
Diagnostic or antibody testing is not recommended for vaccine decision making , CDC ’s Dr . Sarah Mbaeyi said during a presentation to the committee . 
However , people with a current infection should not be vaccinated until a person has recovered , if they had symptoms , and if they ’re clear to leave isolation . 
There ’s no recommended minimum period between infection and vaccination , but since it appears reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection , vaccination could be delayed until near the end of that period . 
People who have a known Covid 19 exposure should not seek vaccination until their quarantine period has ended , to avoid exposing health care workers and others . 
However , residents of long term care facilities , for example , are already in contact with workers and they can be vaccinated , even if they ’ve been exposed . 
More info : There ’s no safety or efficacy data for the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine in people who were treated for Covid 19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma , Mbaeyi said , but vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days " as a precautionary measure , until additional information becomes available to avoid interference of the treatment with vaccine induced immune responses .
