Members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention â€™s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) said Saturday that their evaluation of Pfizer and Bio NTech coronavirus vaccine was independent and transparent . 
ACIP member Veronica Mc Nally , assistant dean for experiential education at Michigan State University College of Law , noted that the group has held nine meetings and heard more than 70 presentations on Covid 19 and the Covid 19 vaccine since February . 
" At this time , we are asked how to do the greatest good . 
As the pandemic continues to spread , hospitalizations are at record levels , I vote to make vaccines available by the CDC prioritization schedule , " said ACIP member Dr . Katherine Poehling , a pediatrics professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine . 
" I will take this vaccine and will recommend it to my family members as well . "
