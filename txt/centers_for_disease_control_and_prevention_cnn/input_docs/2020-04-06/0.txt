The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released instructions and visual tutorials on how to make cloth face coverings from common household materials . 
The CDC recently released guidance recommending the use of cloth face coverings " in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain , especially in areas of significant community based transmission . " 
Cloth face coverings , according to the CDC , can be homemade out of pieces of fabric , T shirts , bandannas and coffee filters to slow down the spread of the virus , especially those that may be asymptomatic and capable of transmitting it to others despite experiencing no symptoms . 
The CDC recommended any homemade cloth face coverings include multiple layers of fabric , be secured to the ears , and allow for breathing without restriction . 
The guidance recommends routinely cleaning coverings in a washing machine and that no child under the age of 2 should wear them .
