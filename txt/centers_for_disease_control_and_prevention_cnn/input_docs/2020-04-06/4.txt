Illinois Gov . 
J.B . Pritzker wasted no time at today 's press confernence in going after the federal government ’s response to Covid 19 , specifically as it pertains to personal protective equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile ( SNS ) . 
The governor , who entered the briefing room wearing a face mask per US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines , immediately called out the White House for changing the stated purpose on the SNS website from an entity that " support states " to one that will " supplement states " in the short term during a public healthcare emergency . 
Pritzker said what his state was sent from the SNS is a " mere fraction of what we asked for . " 
He went on to explain the tedious , sometimes difficult process of trying to obtain PPE from all over the world and " by whatever means necessary " saying he ’s often competing against other states and the federal government for the same supplies . 
To anyone who wants a response to some of the blame shifting coming out of the White House , Pritzker said , " look at the numbers . " 
His state ’s own procurement efforts are what is keeping their first responders outfitted with what they need , he said . 
With the state expecting its warmest day of the year so far on Tuesday , the governor and other health officials are urging residents to " stay at home " and not " congregate in the parks . " 
Illinois reported 1,006 new cases of Covid 19 and 33 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours , according to an announcement by the Department of Health at the governor ’s press briefing Monday . 
The state has a total of 12,262 cases and 307 deaths .
