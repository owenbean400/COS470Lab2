The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to test more people in the United States for antibodies from the novel coronavirus to see whether they have already had the virus , according to a statement from CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund on Monday . 
A set of serological assays , or blood based tests , will be able to detect antibodies that are specific to the virus . 
The tests , which were designed and produced by the vaccine research center at the National Institutes of Health , have already been used to monitor immune response in several coronavirus contact investigations . 
" We are also preparing to deploy them to larger surveys within the coming weeks to further identify individuals who , due to mild infection , may have not known they were infected with SARS Co V 2 and to monitor immunity in recovered individuals , " Nordlund said . 
The US Food and Drug Administration last week issued its first emergency use authorization for a coronavirus test that looks for antibodies in the blood .
