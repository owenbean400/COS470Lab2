Children make up less than 2 % of reported cases of Covid 19 in the United States for which age was known , according to a new report released today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The research , published in the CDC ’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , found 149,082 reported cases between Feb . 12 and April 2 where the patient 's age was known , and 2,572 ( or 1.7 % ) were among children younger than 18 years . 
Infants younger than 1 year made up 15 % of pediatric Covid 19 cases — or 0.27 % of all reported Covid 19 cases with known age . 
Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in the analysis . 
Children seemed to have fewer hospitalizations than adults , according to the report : 20 % of children for whom hospitalization status was known were hospitalized compared to 33 % of 18 to 64 year old adults with known status . 
" Whereas most Covid 19 cases in children are not severe , serious Covid 19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group , " the report said . 
However , data were available for a small proportion of patients , said the researchers . 
For example , hospitalization status was available for 29 % of cases in children younger than 18 years and 31 % of cases in adults ages 18 to 64 years . 
Some more key findings : Among 345 pediatric cases with information on underlying conditions , 80 ( 23 % ) had at least one underlying condition , such as chronic lung disease – which was most commonly reported – and cardiovascular disease . 
For the 295 pediatric cases that had information on both hospitalization status and underlying medical conditions , 28 of 37 ( 77 % ) hospitalized children had one or more underlying medical condition – including all six admitted to an intensive care unit . 
Children who are less than 1 year made up 59 of the 147 ( 40 % ) pediatric hospitalizations and 5 of the 15 ( 33 % ) pediatric ICU admissions . 
Children with Covid 19 might not have reported fever or cough as often as adults , the report also said . 
Among those with available information , 73 % of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever , cough or shortness of breath , compared to 93 % of adults ages 18 to 64 years during the same period .
