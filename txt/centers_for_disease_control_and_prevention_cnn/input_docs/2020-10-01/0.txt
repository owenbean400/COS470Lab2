The latest forecast from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects between 219,000 and 232,000 Americans will have died from coronavirus by Oct . 24 . 
The so called ensemble forecast , based on more than three dozen other forecast models , shows a large variation in predictions of how many people are likely to die in the coming three weeks . 
Some of the variation depends on how people are expected to comply with social distancing measures . 
The last CDC ensemble forecast , released Sept . 24 , projected 214,000 to 226,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by Oct . 17 . 
Unlike some individual models , the CDC â€™s ensemble forecast only offers projections a few weeks into the future . 
According to Johns Hopkins University , 206,825 people have died from coronavirus in the US , with 7.2 million reported cases .
