The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that the no sail order for cruise ships would be extended through to October 31 . 
On Tuesday , a federal health official told CNN that CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield failed to convince the White House to extend it into next year . 
The CDC 's statement said that recent outbreaks on cruise ships had proven that the vessels could be used to " transmit and amplify " the spread of the coronavirus , raising the chance of new infections in US communities . 
" Recent passenger voyages in foreign countries continue to have outbreaks , despite cruise ship operators having extensive health and safety protocols to prevent the transmission of ( coronavirus ) on board , " the statement said .
