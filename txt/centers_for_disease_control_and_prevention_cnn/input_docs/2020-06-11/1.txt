There are serious errors being made in the metrics that are being tracked in the United States when it comes to Covid 19 , according to Dr . Tom Frieden , the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and current president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives . 
These errors are undermining how quickly and how well the US can control Covid 19 and restore the economy , Frieden said during a webinar on Thursday . 
Some of the areas that are being focused on which Frieden says are not as important as they are being made out to be include case counts — which he says are relatively meaningless in most of the country — as well as the total number of tests being conducted , and the test positivity rate . 
Frieden and his colleagues believe that other metrics are more important when it comes to understanding and controlling Covid 19 . 
Dr . Cyrus Shahpar , Resolve to Save Lives ’ director , listed some of the more important numbers to focus on to help governments and communities to form response plans for Covid 19 . 
These included unlinked infections , proportion of cases among quarantine contacts , number of health care worker infections , trends in excess mortality and demographic trends . 
Unlinked infections , for example , are a good number to track because details about them can be used to improve contact tracing . 
" If the metrics that matter are used by governments and communities , we will be better equipped to fight the virus [ and ] save more lives , " Shahpar said .
