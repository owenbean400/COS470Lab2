Republican Rep . 
Rodney Davis of Illinois announced today he has tested positive for Covid 19 . 
" This morning , I tested positive for COVID 19 . 
Since the beginning of this pandemic , I have taken my temperature twice daily because serving in Congress means I interact with many people , and it ’s my duty to protect the health of those I serve . 
This morning , my temperature clocked in at 99 degrees Fahrenheit , which is higher than normal for me , " he said in a statement . 
He added , " Having consulted with the Office of the Attending Physician ( OAP ) of Congress and local county health officials , our office is contacting constituents I have met with in person within the previous 48 hours , per CDC guidelines . " 
His statement continued , " My staff and I take COVID 19 very seriously . 
My wife is a nurse and a cancer survivor , which puts her in an at risk category like so many Americans . 
My office and I have always followed and will continue to follow CDC guidelines , use social distancing , and wear masks or face coverings when social distancing cannot be maintained . 
I will postpone public events our office has planned for the coming days until I receive a negative test . 
I will continue to serve my constituents virtually from home while I quarantine . 
Our district offices throughout central and southwestern Illinois remain open for constituents as well . 
During these challenging times , protecting the public health is my highest priority . 
If you ’re out in public , use social distancing , and when you ca not social distance , please wear a mask . 
All of us must do our part . 
That ’s what it will take to get through this pandemic . " 
CNN 's Manu Raju noted that Davis has been wearing a mask on the Hill .
