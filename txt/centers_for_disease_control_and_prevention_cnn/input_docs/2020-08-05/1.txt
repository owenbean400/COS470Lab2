The recent Covid 19 outbreak at a sleep away camp in Georgia is not necessarily an example of what might happen when schools open , Dr . George Rutherford , principal investigator of the state of California ’s contract tracing program , said Wednesday . 
Some background : The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on the outbreak as a cautionary tale about what might happen at schools if they open for in person learning . 
More than 40 % of campers and staff at the camp became infected with coronavirus . 
Both Rutherford and the CDC report pointed out that the children were not wearing masks , there was regular singing and cheering and that windows and doors were closed in the cabins . 
These closed windows and doors probably increased recirculated air and the risk factors , according to Rutherford . 
" We ’ve always known that children could get infected . 
We ’ve always known that children could infect other people , just not at the same rates , " Rutherford said . 
" And if you put them into an intensive situation like this , these are the kinds of results you can expect . " 
Rutherford said that bars and churches were places that worried him when it comes to transmission of Covid 19 . 
" If you have places with the windows all shut , people singing , it ’s like Georgia summer camp , okay , it ’s not a great idea , " he said . 
" If you ’re going to do that stuff , they have to be outside and people have to be socially distant . "
