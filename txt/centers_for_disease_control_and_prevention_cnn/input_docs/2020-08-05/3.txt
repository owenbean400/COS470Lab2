Google is chiming into the Covid 19 discourse using a " Google Doodle " to emphasize the importance of wearing a mask . 
Their homepage is featuring a Google logo that shows each letter doing its part and following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) guidelines . 
In the short doodle scene , the letters are brandishing colorful masks . 
They sprout feet and shuffle away from each other to demonstrate their effort to social distance . 
The letter " e " sends " a " heart emoji into the air , depicting adherence to CDC guidelines as an act of compassion towards its fellow letters . 
Clicking on the animation takes the viewer to Google 's Covid 19 prevention page where there are additional safety tips . 
Google is also using other platforms to highlight this message including You Tube and Google Maps . 
A PSA on You Tube reminds people that wearing masks is a simple way that can reduce Covid 19 transmission by 80 % . 
It is imploring individuals to " Do it for them . 
Do it for you . 
Do it for all of us . "
