When his daughter was born , Alex Kaplan thought his home was babyproof . 
He was wrong . 
" We have a wily little girl , " said Kaplan , who lives in Washington , D.C . " At 9 months old , she managed to open a childproof — in air quotes — bottle of acetaminophen . " 
When Kaplan found her , she was smeared in a sticky mess from putting the gel caps in her mouth . 
" Acetaminophen , we came to learn , is very dangerous and dose dependent , " said Kaplan , who called poison control then headed to the closest emergency room . 
Kaplan 's daughter was fine , but accidental poisoning is a serious problem for American kids . 
More than 300 children are treated for poisoning each day in emergency departments across the United States , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
On average , two of those kids will die .

And some experts believe the spike is due to the very same cleaning products parents are using to protect their families from infection .
