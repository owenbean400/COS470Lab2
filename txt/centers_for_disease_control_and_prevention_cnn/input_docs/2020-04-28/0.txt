Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , says current technology makes it impossible to test every American for coronavirus . 
The United States , she says , will need a " breakthrough " in testing to screen large numbers of people . 
According to Birx , that breakthrough is antigen testing . 
What antigen tests do : Often used to check for the flu and strep , antigen tests look for pieces of a virus -- often the proteins that cover its surface . 
How that differs from most coronavirus tests : These look for the virus ' genetic material and require a number of chemicals to run , many of which are in short supply . 
The tests can also take hours to run . 
A quicker solution ? 
Antigen tests are simpler -- and potentially less reliable -- but they can provide results in as little as 15 minutes , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Why does not the US already have multiple tests ? 
For starters , the tests are not easy to make , and validating their accuracy can be time consuming and expensive . 
For another , there has not been a big market for them before now . 
WHO cautions against them : While some companies claim to have developed rapid antigen tests , the World Health Organization is cautioning against their use -- at least for now , until more is known .
