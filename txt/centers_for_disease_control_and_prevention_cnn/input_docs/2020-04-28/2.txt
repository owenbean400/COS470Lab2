Los Angeles County will expand coronavirus testing Tuesday to include delivery drivers , rideshare drivers , and taxi drivers even if they 're asymptomatic , Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said . 
Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said 1,000 asymptomatic residents will undergo diagnostic and antibody testing by Friday to evaluate exposure to the virus in the city . 
And beginning Tuesday , health workers will start visiting randomly selected homes in two of Georgia 's largest counties to conduct antibody testing through blood samples . 
In New York , about 15 % of the 7,500 people who have been tested in the state 's antibody study have tested positive , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said . 
But the former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told medical news website Stat on Monday those tests are " not ready for prime time . " 
" As we learn whether that means you are protected in the future , there could be value in that , " Dr . Richard Besser told Stat reporter Helen Branswell about the tests , but " the science is not there yet to be able to say what those tests mean . "
