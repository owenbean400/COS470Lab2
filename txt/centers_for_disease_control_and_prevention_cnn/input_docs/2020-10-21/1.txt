The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its definition of a close contact with a Covid 19 patient to include multiple , brief exposures , director Dr . Robert Redfield said Wednesday . 
The new definition includes exposures adding up to a total of 15 minutes spent six feet or closer to an infected person . 
Previously , the CDC defined a close contact as 15 minutes of continuous exposure to an infected individual . 
Some background : The agency changed the definition after a report from Vermont of a corrections officer who became infected after several brief interactions with coronavirus positive inmates â€“ none of them lasting 15 minutes , but adding up over time . 
" As we get more data and understand the science of Covid , we are going to incorporate that in our recommendations , " Redfield said at a news conference held at CDC headquarters in Atlanta . 
" Originally , contact that was considered to be high risk for potential exposure to Covid was someone within six feet for more than 15 minutes . " 
The new data is being incorporated into recommendations , he said .
