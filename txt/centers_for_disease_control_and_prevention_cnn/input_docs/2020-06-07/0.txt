The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday said it ’s closely monitoring the demonstrations happening across America . 
The comments come amid concerns that the protests – like other gatherings – could spur additional coronavirus transmission . 
" It is too early to know what , if any , effect these events will have on the federal COVID 19 response . 
Every local situation is different . 
State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground , " she said . 
Earlier this week : CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for coronavirus . 
" We really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested , " Redfield said Thursday at a House Appropriations hearing on the Covid 19 response . 
" I do think there is a potential , unfortunately , for this to be a seeding event , " he said – especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission . 
During an exchange with Rep . 
Mark Pocan ( D WI ) , Redfield also addressed the use of tear gas and similar chemical agents on protesters . 
Redfield said that in his experience , the agents can cause people to cough . 
" Definitely coughing can spread respiratory viruses , including Covid 19 , " Redfield said . 
Pocan asked Redfield if he had advised the President or worked with law enforcement to discontinue the use of chemical agents during the pandemic . 
" I think you raised an important point . 
We have advocated strongly the ability to have face coverings and masks available to protesters , so that they can at least have those coverings , " Redfield said . 
Pressed by Pocan on whether he would recommend against the agents , Redfield said he would " pass on this comment to the next Task Force meeting . "
