People with Down syndrome have 10 times the risk of dying from Covid 19 compared to those without the disability , a team of researchers reported Thursday . 
They also found a four fold increased risk of coronavirus related hospitalizations for those with Down syndrome , " a group that is not currently strategically protected , " according to the report in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . 
Their analysis involved more than 8 million adults who were part of a coronavirus risk assessment project sponsored by the British government . 
Of the 8.26 million people in the tracking study , 4,053 had Down syndrome . 
Of those , 68 people with the disability died and 40 % were killed by Covid 19 . 
Seventeen died of pneumonia or pneumonitis and 35 % died of other causes . 
Those numbers compare with more than 41,000 people without Down syndrome who died , but just 20 % died from the coronavirus , 14 % from pneumonia or pneumonitis and 65 % died of other causes . 
Down syndrome is not included in any guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the UK â€™s health ministry as a condition that would put people at increased risk for Covid 19 . 
Down syndrome is the most common genetic condition diagnosed in the United States every year , according to the CDC , with more than 6,000 babies born with the disability every year . 
Down syndrome occurs in one in every 700 babies .
