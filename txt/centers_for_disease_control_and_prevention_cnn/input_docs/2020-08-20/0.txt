Dr . Anthony Fauci , the US ' top infectious disease doctor , told CNN on Wednesday that Phase 3 clinical trials for coronavirus vaccines should aim to include minorities at levels that are at least double their representation in the population . 
So far , that ’s significantly higher than the participation levels of minorities in the trial being run by Moderna , the first US company to start a Covid 19 vaccine trial . 
The data : According to Census data , Black people represent 13 % of the US population . 
Doubling that would mean 26 % of participants should be Black for the trial . 
But so far , Black people represent only 4.5 % of Moderna ’s study participants , according to data obtained by CNN . 
Census data show Latinos represent 18 % of the US population , and doubling that would mean 36 % of participants should be Latino for the trial . 
However , only about 10 % of Moderna ’s trial participants are Latino . 
Importance of minority representation : Fauci made clear these levels are goals , not requirements . 
But sufficient numbers of minorities are crucial in order to determine safety and efficacy for these groups , which are disproportionately affected by the virus in the US . 
A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , examining reports of nearly 600,000 coronavirus cases where race was indicated , found that while 13 % of the population is Black , 22 % of cases were Black . 
The report also found that while 18 % of the US population is Latino , 33 % of cases were Latino .
