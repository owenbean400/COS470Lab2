Prisons are hotspot for the spread of coronavirus , but inmates are not getting the medical attention they need , Dr . Homer Venters , former chief medical officer of New York City Correctional Health Services , said Thursday . 
Venters said his investigation of Covid 19 responses in 40 jurisdictions around the country , including federal prisons , local jails and immigration detention centers , showed " systematic racism . " 
Agencies such as the US Department of Health and Human Services or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which would normally provide quality assurance in care facilities , " are all essentially AWOL when it comes to the health and health care of people who are detained and that â€™s not an accident . 
It is really one of the most poignant ongoing representations of systematic racism in our nation , " he said . 
Research has shown that people of color are disproportionately represented in the US prison system .
