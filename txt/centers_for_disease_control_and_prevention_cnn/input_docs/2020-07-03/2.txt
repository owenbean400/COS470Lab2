US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams urged caution when looking at the US death rate for the virus remaining flat while the number of new cases increases . 
However , Adams said , " What we 're really worried about — particularly with young people — is that they get it and then they spread it to their grandmother , to their grandfather . " 
Adams called on the younger population to wear a face covering , practice social distancing when going out this weekend , and to take extra precautions if they live with someone who is older or vulnerable . 
The latest figures : According to Johns Hopkins University 's tally of cases in the US , at least 128,740 people have died in the country from coronavirus . 
An ensemble forecast published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects nearly 148,000 coronavirus deaths in the country by July 25 . 
This week ’s national forecast relies on 24 individual forecasts from outside institutions and researchers . 
The new projections , published Thursday , forecast 147,865 deaths by July 25 , with a possible range of about 139,000 to 161,000 deaths . 
Unlike some individual models , the CDC ’s ensemble forecast only offers projections for the next month . 
The previous ensemble forecast , published last Wednesday , projected about 139,000 coronavirus deaths by July 18 .
