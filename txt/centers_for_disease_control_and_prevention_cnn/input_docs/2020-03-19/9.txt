Vice President Mike Pence , the head of the Trump administration â€™s coronavirus task force , said that " tens of thousands " of tests are being conducted across the country daily , and testing centers are now required by law to report those test numbers . 
" Because of the public private partnership that the President initiated several weeks ago , tens and thousands of tests are being performed every day , " Pence said at a Thursday press briefing at the White House . 
In addition , he said , " state and private labs are now required by law to report all coronavirus testing directly to the CDC , which will give the American public and our research timely and important information . " 
More context : The administration has come under increasing criticism in recent days for being unable to say how many people in the United States have been tested . 
Still , Pence encouraged only those with symptoms to get tested , despite the possibility of asymptomatic spread . 
" It is important for every American to remember , if you do not have symptoms , you do not need the test , " he said .
