Public health and regulatory experts signed an open letter to FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn on Friday , demanding transparency and outlining steps to maintain the agency ’s integrity . 
The 33 signees of the # Protect The FDA letter included Dr . Luciana Borio , former chief scientist for the US Food and Drug Administration ; 
Dr . Aaron Kesselheim , head of the Program On Regulation , Therapeutics , and Law at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women ’s Hospital ; 
Dr . Peter Lurie , president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest ; and Dr . Eric Topol , director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute . 
If decisions are made on data that ’s evolving quickly , the authors said , there should be " a clear follow up plan " that explains how more data will be collected and the process for re evaluating the decision . 
" The FDA must enforce these timelines and be ready to modify or reverse its initial decision if better data require doing so , " the letter added . 
The authors said that undermining the FDA by allowing political interference would harm the public . 
The letter listed eight points for the FDA to act on , including insisting that " the President and his White House advisers refrain from criticizing federal scientists , their scientific conclusions , measurements , or methodologies " and sharing " key data and consultation with scientists from … the NIAID , the NIH , the CDC , FDA ’s Vaccines and Related Products Advisory Committee , and the Infectious Diseases Society of America " before making any decision on authorizing a Covid 19 vaccine . 
The signees of the letter also called on the FDA to " commit to publicly challenging claims by any government officials that are inconsistent with the evidence evaluated by FDA scientists in issuing its decisions . "
