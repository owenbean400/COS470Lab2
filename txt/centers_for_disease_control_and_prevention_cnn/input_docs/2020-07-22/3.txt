US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said that while the US food supply is safe , the system itself has come under pressure from the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Early on , he said , the food division of the FDA anticipated that if people who work in the food industry were to get sick , that it would put pressure on the US food supply . 
" And I think we ’ve seen that bear out , " Hahn said . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a significant number of deaths and cases in the food industry . 
As of July 7 , the CDC reported that among the 23 states reporting Covid 19 outbreaks in meat and poultry processing facilities , there were 16,233 cases in 239 facilities , including 86 Covid 19 related deaths . 
These cases and deaths disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities , with nearly 90 % of the cases were among ethnic and racial minority groups . 
Hahn said the FDA is working closely with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the CDC , as well as with food industry groups , to determine where the problems are that may encourage the spread of the disease . 
The FDA has developed an internal tool that matches information about the food supply with information about Covid 19 hot spots , so it can predict and proactively address potential problems with suppliers . 
The FDA also has been working with other agencies and the industry to take a closer look at workers ’ living and working conditions . 
Both make it difficult to physically distance and reduce the spread . 
Hahn said the FDA wants to figure out how to get these workers more personal protective equipment and how to make sure they ’re among the first groups to get a vaccine when one is approved .
