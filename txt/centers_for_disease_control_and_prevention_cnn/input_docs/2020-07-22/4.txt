Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer further dug into Republicans Wednesday over their " dysfunction " and " disarray " on the next coronavirus relief bill . 
" This is not the typical Republican disfunction on whether or not they did not or did see the President ’s last tweet , " he also said . 
" The disarray on the Republican side has real consequences . " 
Schumer also noted Democrats will be sending a letter to the administration " to demand answers on how data is being reported to the White House , " he said , referring to the recent announcement that hospital data on coronavirus patients will be sent directly to the administration instead of being first sent to the CDC . 
He added that if the administration " refuses to reverse course , " Democrats will demand data transparency be included in the next relief bill . 
On President Trump resuming his coronavirus task force press briefings , he said , it ’s " remarkable " that he ’s " lowered the bar so much " that his performance yesterday was seen as a " change in tone . " 
" Americans must be hanging their heads in shame and disbelief that this administration is still trying to sort out the basics , " he said . 
Schumer also criticized Trump for calling the coronavirus the ‘ China virus ’ at his press conference , saying it shows how he continues to " deflect blame " . 
" President Trump started his press conference by labeling Covid 19 , the China virus , which shows the President ’s still trying to deflect blame , play political games with this deadly serious virus . 
Games that are divisive , " Schumer said .
