Face masks and social distancing will play an important role in reopening schools , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said on Wednesday . 
" It 's so important now to work together with school districts to figure out how they can take our guidelines and operationalize them in a practical way . 
And to do it in a way that is safe for those who are vulnerable , particularly the teachers and those children . 
â€¦ And one of the most important things is going to be the role of face masks and the role of social distancing in those classrooms , " Redfield added .
