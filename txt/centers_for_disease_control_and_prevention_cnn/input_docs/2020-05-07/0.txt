Go for a walk , visit any open establishment or public space , and you will note a disconcerting phenomenon : People without masks . 
There is a pandemic . 
Tens of thousands of Americans are dead because of Covid 19 , a disease that spreads in droplets that are expelled by infected humans , including as they talk or cough , and whether they show symptoms or not . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering in public , especially where there is a high degree of community based transmission ( that is , when the source of infection is unknown ) . 
I live in California , where nearly 60,000 people have been infected . 
Across the country 1.2 million Americans have tested positive for Covid 19 , with more than 73,000 lives lost -- and projections for the future ( another peak in the fall ? ) are really grim . 
Meanwhile , hospitals and their staff are pushed to the breaking point caring for the sick , with medical staff working weeks without days off to treat the afflicted , risking their own lives and those of their family . 
And yet , so many people refuse to take warnings seriously to protect themselves and others by wearing a mask in public . 
It 's hard to pinpoint how many of us are clueless and careless -- maybe half of those who go outside ? 
A third ? 
Some other fraction ? 
-- but it 's certainly way too many . 
The lack of empathy is jarring . 
We need a shift .
