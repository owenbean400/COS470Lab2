The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued revised guidance on Monday for women who are breastfeeding while they have suspected or confirmed Covid 19 , saying breast milk is " not a likely source of infection . " 
Previously , the CDC had said it was not known whether mothers could transmit the virus via breast milk . 
In the latest guidance , the agency said a woman with suspected or confirmed Covid 19 should follow guidelines on home quarantine or isolation . 
The child being breastfed should be considered a close contact and be quarantined during the parent 's recommended period of home isolation and for 14 days thereafter . 
The guidelines also suggest precautions while breastfeeding for those with suspected or confirmed Covid 19 : Wash hands before touching child or expressing breast milk Wear a mask when less than 6 feet from the child Clean and sanitize breast pumps If the mother prefers not to breast feed or bottle feed their child while sick , the CDC said a healthy caregiver who is not at risk for severe illness from Covid 19 may feed expressed breast milk to the child . 
If the child has suspected or confirmed Covid 19 , the agency recommends mothers wear masks while breastfeeding and wash hands frequently .
