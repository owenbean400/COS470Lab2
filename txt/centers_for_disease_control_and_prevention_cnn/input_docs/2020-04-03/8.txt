While discussing the question of whether his administration will advise citizens to use masks today , President Donald Trump claimed that some scarves can be more effective against the coronavirus , when used to cover people 's faces , than masks themselves . 
Trump also said that new recommendations for civilians using masks will come out soon .

The guidance also states that " caution should be exercised when considering this option " and that face shields should be used in addition to these homemade masks .
