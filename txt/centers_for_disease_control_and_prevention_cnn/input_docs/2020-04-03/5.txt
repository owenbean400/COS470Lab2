Should you or should not you wear a face mask during the coronavirus pandemic ? 
Here 's what health organizations and top experts say . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention : The organization recommends that if you are not sick , " you do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick . " 
However , if you are sick , " You should wear a facemask when you are around other people ( e.g . , sharing a room or vehicle ) and before you enter a healthcare provider ’s office , " the CDC said . 
The World Health Organization : WHO is standing by its recommendation to only wear a mask if you are sick or caring for someone who is sick . 
" Mask wearing by the general public is not among the WHO ’s recommendations , " the organization said . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy : Moments ago , he said masks should not be used as a substitute for social distancing , but rather can be used as a supplement . 
" Because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak as opposed to coughing and sneezing , the better part of valor is that when you 're out and you ca not maintain that six foot distance to wear some sort of facial covering . " has said that the White House Task Force is actively discussing guidelines on masks . 
CNN 's Sanjay Gupta : He explained that masks could help people who have coronavirus but not have symptoms from spreading the virus . 
" The way to think about this mask issue is that it 's not really , still , for people who are not infected . 
This is more for people who might be infected and do not know it , and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else . " 
He stressed that social distancing is the best best way to fight the spread of coronavirus , and said that N95 respirators should be reserved for health care workers .
