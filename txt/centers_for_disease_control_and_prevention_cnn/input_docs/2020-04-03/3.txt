The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , in consultation with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , issued new guidance Thursday to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in long term care facilities like nursing homes . 
Long term care facilities are now advising : To immediately start screening staff for symptoms and start temperature checks . 
Every resident should also have their temperature checked every day . 
Patients and residents who are entering the facilities should also be screened for Covid 19 . 
Staff should wear a face mask inside the facility . 
If there is a Covid 19 case in the facility , health care personnel should wear full personal protective equipment for the care of all residents , regardless of a resident â€™s diagnosis or symptoms . 
Residents are encouraged to cover their noses and mouths when staff are in their room . 
" Residents can use tissues for this , " the guidance said . 
" They could also use cloth , non medical masks when those are available . " 
Facilities should use the same staff for the same patients , regardless of symptoms or Covid 19 status . 
The goal is to decrease the number of different staff interacting with patients and residents , and the number of times staff interact with patients . 
The hope is a staff member who works with the same resident would be able to detect symptoms early , if the patient or resident gets infected . 
Facilities are encouraged to separate infected patients and residents from those who are not sick . 
The CDC said Tuesday that around 400 long term care facilities have at least one Covid 19 patient . 
The elderly and people with underlying health conditions face greater risks of complications if they contract the virus .
