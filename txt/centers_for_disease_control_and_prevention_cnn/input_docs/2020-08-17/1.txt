A former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner has called the US response to Covid 19 " disappointing " and said there was no good excuse for it because people have been practicing for this very scenario . 
" There have been efforts now over a number of decades , truly , to better prepare our nation against a range of biological threats , to invest in certain critical resources , but also to practice against simulations of threats , " former FDA commissioner Dr . Margaret Hamburg said Monday during a American Society for Microbiology briefing . 
" I think where dropped the ball was , you know , first the [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ] test turned out not to work well there were issues around that test , " Hamburg added . 
Though " surprising " the CDC had those issue , they were " undeniable , " she said . 
There are a number of lessons to be learned — including " fundamental — about taking the threat seriously . " 
And also the importance of strong leadership , along with " rapid and comprehensive response , " while using and engaging the tools of science and technology , she said .
