Thousands of vials of the long awaited Covid 19 vaccine are slated to arrive in all 50 states Monday , as top US health officials express hope that health care workers can begin administering the injections immediately . 
The news comes after the Pfizer Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine cleared its final hurdle : Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , accepted an advisory committee 's recommendation Saturday that the vaccine may be given to people 16 and older , meaning it can now be administered in the United States . 
In a statement issued Sunday , Redfield announced he had accepted the recommendation from the CDC 's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices . 
The first vaccinations are " set to start as early as Monday , " he said . 
Dr . Stephen Hahn , commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , too , said his " greatest hope and desire " is that the vaccinations begin Monday . 
" My hope , again , is that this happens very expeditiously , hopefully tomorrow , " Hahn told CNN on Sunday . 
" We 've seen the vaccines go out . 
We 've seen the press reports of hospitals waiting to vaccinate health care workers and those most vulnerable . " 
Vaccines roll out : The decision comes the same day that the first batch of vaccines was loaded onto trucks at a Pfizer plant in Portage , Michigan , and shipped out across the country . 
Freight trucks carrying about 184,275 vials of vaccine departed the plant , and the combined 189 boxes of vaccine vials are expected to arrive in all 50 states Monday .
