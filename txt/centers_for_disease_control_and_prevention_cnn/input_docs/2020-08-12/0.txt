Quickly performing facility wide coronavirus testing after a Covid 19 case is identified might help control its transmission among residents and health care workers , according to research published Tuesday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention â€™s ( CDC ) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . 
Nursing homes are some of the highest risk environments for contracting Covid 19 in the US . 
Authors from the CDC compiled data from seven state and local health departments that conducted facility wide testing in a total of 288 nursing homes from March 24 to June 14 . 
The researchers found that health departments in Arkansas , Detroit , New Mexico , Utah and Vermont performed facility wide Covid 19 tests in 93 nursing homes , which helped authorities detect new cases in 79 % of facilities . 
As well as being a high risk environment for elderly patients , nursing homes also pose a health risk to the employees who work there . 
More than 900 US health care workers have died of Covid 19 , according to a news release from the Kaiser Family Foundation published Wednesday .
