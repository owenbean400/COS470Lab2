Patients with a rare , coronavirus linked condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children , or MIS C , suffer sudden , severe inflammation and changes in the blood that promote clotting , British researchers reported Tuesday . 
In the most acute phase , the children had raised levels of inflammatory immune system molecules called cytokines , and reduced levels of white blood cells known as lymphocytes . 
But with treatment , these symptoms returned to normal , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Medicine . 
Shankar Hari â€™s team studied 25 children with MIS C . Most , but not all , tested positive for coronavirus . 
Those who did not , likely had contact with coronavirus patients and may have cleared all signs of the virus by the time they developed the syndrome , the team reported . 
MIS C appears different from symptoms seen in adults with coronavirus , the researchers said . 
Different types of immune cells are activated or suppressed in each case , which suggests they are distinct syndromes . 
In addition , children who tested positive for the virus had more severe illness than the children who tested negative . 
Some background : MIS C remains rare but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 570 confirmed cases of MIS C and 10 deaths in 40 states and Washington , DC . 
More than 70 % of reported cases have been in Latino or Black children . 
" Most children developed MIS C 2-4 weeks after infection with SARS Co V 2 , " the CDC says .
