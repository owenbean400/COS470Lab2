Despite the surge of coronavirus cases across the United States , many attendees seen at the White House 's Salute to America event on the South Lawn are not practicing social distancing or wearing masks ahead of President Donald Trump 's Fourth of July remarks . 
The Washington , DC , celebration does not appear to be following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines concerning gatherings despite deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere telling CNN this week that the White House would enforce social distancing . 
CNN has asked the White House whether guests are being tested or having temperatures checked but has yet to receive a response . 
The White House stopped temperature checks of all those entering the White House grounds weeks ago . Reporters at Saturday 's event have not been tested or received a temperature check . 
A campaign aide familiar with the President 's prepared remarks for Saturday night characterized them as " patriotic " and said the President will celebrate America 's founding and the triumphs of American history while saluting the US military . 
The aide said the President " will appeal to the very best in the American Character . "
