In a joint statement Tuesday , the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams announced their games at the new So Fi Stadium will be held without fans , at least for the immediate future . 
The 70,240 seat facility in Inglewood , California , is home to both Los Angeles area NFL teams , with the Rams set to host the Dallas Cowboys in their home opener the evening of September 13 , and the Chargers hosting the NFL champion Kansas City Chiefs the following Sunday . 
In Tuesday ’s announcement , the Rams pledged to " continue to work with LA County Department of Public Health and the City of Inglewood on a plan that , when circumstances permit , safely brings fans to So Fi Stadium and adheres to local , State , CDC and NFL guidelines . " 
According to the Chargers , " While not being able to open So Fi Stadium with fans in attendance is heartbreaking , we are grateful for the opportunity to play NFL football this Fall … " We know our community , however , is still in the throes of a pandemic , and our only way out is to heed the guidance of state and local health officials and community leaders . 
Every decision we have made – and every decision we will make in the future – begins and ends with the health and safety of our community , players , coaches and staff in mind . "
