Guatemala President Alejandro Giammattei denounced several reported attacks on people returning to Guatemala from overseas , particularly those arriving from the United States . 
During a government news conference Sunday , Giammattei asked Guatemalans to treat these people not as " criminals " but rather as " brothers . " 
The person who returned from abroad had attained the proper paperwork demonstrating they had tested negative for coronavirus and had followed all necessary quarantine measures , Giammattei said . 
This comes after his announcement last week that deportation flights into Guatemala were to be suspended after a CDC mission in the country found several positive cases that had recently returned to the country . 
Giammattei also stressed that many of those returning to Guatemala had been sending back remittances to family members only months prior to the pandemic .
