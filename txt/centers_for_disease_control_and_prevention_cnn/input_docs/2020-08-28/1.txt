Pharmacists will be able to administer the Covid 19 vaccine to children and adults once a vaccine becomes available , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said during a phone call with reporters on Friday . 
Last week , the US Health and Human Services Department said it would authorize any state licensed pharmacist to administer childhood vaccines . 
The department said it had amended the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ( PREP Act ) to allow all state licensed pharmacists to immunize children over the age of 3 . 
" It was one of the really important decisions to engage pharmacists to be able to distribute vaccines , " Redfield said on Friday . 
" It â€™s really been one of the most important public health decisions for getting vaccine distributed to the American public , " Redfield said . 
" We do see that pharmacies will continue to be an important component of our vaccine distribution plan . "
