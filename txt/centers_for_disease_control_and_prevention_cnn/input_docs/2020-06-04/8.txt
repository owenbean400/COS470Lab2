Flu vaccines and social distancing will be important defenses against coronavirus in the upcoming months , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , said on Thursday . 
If a second wave of coronavirus hits when flu season is underway , it could really strain hospitals , Redfield said at a House Appropriations committee hearing on the Covid 19 response .
