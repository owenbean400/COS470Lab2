A new federal testing protocol calling for demographic information to be included with coronavirus tests is aimed at addressing racial and social disparities across the US , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , said Thursday . 
Speaking with Rep . 
Cheri Bustos , a Democrat from Illinois , at the House Appropriations hearing on the Covid 19 response , Redfield said he is concerned about the impact of coronavirus among communities of color . 
Bustos said communities of color often have limited access to certain resources , such as healthy foods , leading to higher risks of contracting Covid 19 . 
Redfield agreed . 
The Health and Human Services Department released new guidance Thursday asking for testing sites to include demographic data like race , ethnicity , age , and sex . 
" I have every intent to get that data so we can begin to understand . 
Clearly , increasing access to knowledge of infection in vulnerable communities is critical to getting testing more available there , " Redfield said . 
Responding to Rep . 
Tom Cole , a Republican from Oklahoma , Redfield spoke out about the disproportionate impact of Covid 19 on the Native American community and the resources that have been provided to them to try to help . 
As well as financial support , these include a number of rapid response teams " to basically provide technical assistance because they have had some of the more significant outbreaks . "
