Protesters need to be evaluated and tested for coronavirus , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Thursday . 
" We really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested , " Redfield said at a House Appropriations hearing on the Covid 19 response . 
" I do think there is a potential , unfortunately for this to be a seeding event , " he said — especially those in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission . 
During an exchange with Rep . 
Mark Pocan ( D WI ) , Redfield addressed the use of tear gas on protesters . 
Redfield said in his experience tear gas can cause people to cough – not a good thing during a pandemic involving a respiratory virus . 
Pocan asked Redfield if he had advised the President or worked with law enforcement to discontinue to use of tear gas during the pandemic . 
" I think you raised an important point we have advocated strongly — the ability to have face coverings and masks available to protesters , so that they can at least have those coverings , " Redfield said . 
Redfield added he would " pass on this comment to next Task Force meeting . "
