Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said he is " deeply saddened personally , by the many thousands of lives that have been lost to Covid 19 in the United States and around the world . " 
On Thursday , speaking during a House Appropriations hearing on the Covid 19 response , Redfield said the US is getting a wake up call . 
" We must resolve — we can and we must — lessen the health disparities in this nation , " he added . 
Some context : Redfield has defended the CDC 's surveillance for coronavirus and denied that the agency missed the spread of the virus across the country . 
" We were never blind when it came to surveillance for coronavirus 19 , " Redfield told reporters May 29 . 
Redfield was discussing a CDC report that shows the virus was already spreading some in January and early February in Washington state and other Pacific Northwest areas , much earlier than when the first case of community spread was confirmed in the United States in late February . 
CDC previously has been criticized for its slow response to the coronavirus outbreak .
