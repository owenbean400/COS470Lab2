The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that some people may be putting off emergency care for serious health conditions during the coronavirus pandemic -- and fewer visits for critical conditions could result in complications or even death . 
During the pandemic , the total number of visits to hospital emergency departments across the United States for conditions other than Covid 19 was 42 % lower than during this same time last year , according to a new CDC report .
