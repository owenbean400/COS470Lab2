US states should be ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine by November 1 " just in case " one is ready , Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said in an ABC News interview Friday . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has asked state public health officials to prepare to distribute a coronavirus vaccine by late October or early November . 
Adams said the guidance is " just in case " a vaccine is approved by that time -- reiterating comments by public health officials that such an event is possible but not probable . 
He added that data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials has been positive , and independent safety boards ensure the vaccine only moves forward if " there is good evidence " of its efficacy . 
" The most telling thing I can say to people is that when there is a Covid vaccine available , I and my family will be in line to get it , " Adams said . 
" I think it will be safe , I think it will be effective and I think it will help us end this outbreak . "
