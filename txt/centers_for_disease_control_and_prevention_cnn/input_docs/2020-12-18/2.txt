Dr . Anthony Fauci said it 's very likely we will see people getting vaccinated with the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine " within a few days . " 
When asked about the significance of Moderna 's claims that its vaccine could perhaps prevent infection – in addition to disease – Fauci said " that 's the ultimate goal . " 
The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee ( VRBPAC ) voted 20-0 with one abstention to recommend emergency use authorization for the Moderna vaccine , which is very similar in design , composition , safety and efficacy to Pfizer/Bio NTech 's vaccine . 
That was the only question facing the committee – whether to recommend EUA . 
In expectation that the FDA will soon give the green light , vaccine advisers to the CDC scheduled meetings for Saturday and Sunday to discuss the Moderna vaccine . 
The group must vote to recommend the vaccine and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must accept that recommendation before vaccinations can begin .
