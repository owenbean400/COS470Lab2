A clinician in Fairbanks , Alaska , who received a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday experienced what appeared to be an anaphylactic reaction , according to leadership at Foundation Health Partners ( FHP ) , a health care system linked to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital . 
The employee reported she had no known allergies , though she had once experienced a reaction to a bee sting . 
Ten minutes after receiving the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine , the woman began having what is described as " traditional anaphylactic symptoms , " which included tongue swelling , a hoarse voice and difficulty breathing . 
While the vaccine clinic is stocked with first aid for anaphylaxis , it was not needed . 
Instead , the woman was taken to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital , and clinicians administered two doses of epinephrine . 
She remained at the hospital for observation and was released six hours later . 
She was one of nearly 300 employees to receive the vaccine on Thursday ; their first shipment of vaccines arrived on Wednesday . 
The employee , who wished to remain anonymous , issued a statement : It is not surprising that there have been reports of anaphylaxis associated with the coronavirus vaccine . 
With more and more vaccines being administered every day , reports of adverse reactions will become more common , though they are still few and far between . 
Officials at FHP say they are " working with the State of Alaska Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to share details of the reaction . 
The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the CDC have created several programs for tracking any adverse reactions to the vaccine . 
FHP reported details of yesterday â€™s event to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) . 
This national system collects and analyzes data that helps federal health authorities monitor the safety of vaccines . "
