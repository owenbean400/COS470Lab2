When the governing board of the Queen Creek Unified School District in Arizona voted for all schools to have full time in person classes , teacher Matt Chicci resigned . 
He said the school did not meet the standards set by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which was the reason behind his decision . 
" The infection rate is still high [ in ] Maricopa county , that we live in , " he told CNN ’s Jim Sciutto . 
" Our superintendent of public instruction has even said that schools in Arizona should not be opening . 
And so if the county health department and our superintendent are saying it 's not safe to reopen , it 's not safe to do so . " 
One of Chicci ’s family members is also at high risk , which was a factor in the decision making process , he said . 
" So if I 'm put into a classroom of 30 or more kids , it 's a small room , there 's one exit , the ventilation is not all that great for schools . 
They did increase the air flow , but that does not mean they put in the proper filter to filter out virus particles . 
So it 's not a good situation , " Chicci said . 
He emphasized the need for positivity rates to decrease and better social distancing plans before reopening schools that would help him feel safe to return . 
" The other thing is being able to social distance . 
In a class of 30 I can only keep them two feet apart . 
We did the math and we need classes of 10 , " he explained . 
While the school district said in a statement that parents were given the option to choose between online or in person learning , the same choice was not given to teachers , Chicci said .
