If you have recovered from Covid 19 , you may not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to three months — as long as you do not develop symptoms again , according to recently updated guidance on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's website . 
Regarding who needs to quarantine , the guidance states , " People who have tested positive for COVID 19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again . 
People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID 19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms . " 
A CDC spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Friday that an agency webpage " was updated with that information mid last week . " 
Some context : Preliminary research has suggested previously that after people are infected with the novel coronavirus , their risk of reinfection may be lower in the first three months after their initial infection — but that natural immunity to the virus could start to decline within months as their antibodies may wane over time . 
Antibodies are the proteins the body makes to fight infection .
