Much is still unknown about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak , and health officials are urging vigilance . 
That means travelers crisscrossing the globe should be aware of the virus , steer clear of heavily impacted areas and exercise some of the same kinds of preventive measures they 'd use to avoid influenza and other illnesses . 
But how worried should travelers outside the most impacted areas be about the Wuhan coronavirus ? 
In this era of global travel , you can never say the risk is zero of being exposed to something , says Dr . Yoko Furuya , associate professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Columbia University Irving Medical Center . 
But most of the cases so far have involved Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province . 
It 's not a big concern for US travelers traveling domestically , says Dr . William Schaffner , a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University 's division of infectious diseases . 
Travelers heading to China should be more concerned , he adds . 
" As a matter of fact , I have heard colleagues say to a patient or two , ' Gee , do you have to go to China right now ? 
Why do not you wait a little bit ? ' " People who have traveled to Wuhan in the last few weeks and are feeling sick with fever , cough or are having difficulty breathing should seek medical attention right away and call ahead to inform providers of recent travel and symptoms , according to CDC guidelines .
