Planning is now underway for a federally supported " public health force " to carry out the state level epidemiology " that 's going to be necessary to open the country back up , " a federal health official with knowledge of the planning told CNN . 
The official , who is directly involved in the day to day national coronavirus response , told CNN the plan was part of discussions of next steps by the White House Task Force . 
The Task Force did not respond to CNN 's request for comment . 
The source is essentially providing further detail on what CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield told CNN during a Global Town Hall last week . 
" We 're in the position now of preparing a significant expansion of local public health capacity so that we can operationalize , " Redfield told Dr . Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper . 
Currently , state health departments do not have enough staff to do the level of contact tracing desired by the White House Task Force , according to the official . 
The federal health official told CNN that the " large scale " push for epidemiology is part of the recent initiative led by eight " community protection " CDC field teams deployed in recent weeks . 
Those CDC teams were sent to states where transmission rates are low to assist state and local health departments with contact tracing and testing . 
A CDC spokesperson did not respond to CNN 's request for comment .
