Dr . Robert Redfield , the director of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Monday " it 's important to look at the country as many different separate situations " when asked on the " Today " show if it was conceivable to relax social distancing guidelines by May . Redfield told NBC 's Savannah Guthrie that in his view , a number of things need to happen before reopening the country , including increasing public health capacity to do early case identification , isolation and contract tracing . 
He added officials also need to " start working to rebuild confidence in the community , so the community has confidence to reopen . "
