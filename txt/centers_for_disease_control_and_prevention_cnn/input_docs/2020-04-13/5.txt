The former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr . Tom Frieden , said in an interview today that many of the coronavirus antibody tests on the market are " junk . " 
The comments came in a live streamed interview with STAT ’s Helen Branswell . 
Frieden , who served as CDC director under President Barack Obama , said " there are many bad tests , inaccurate tests on the market . " 
Referring to a historical surge in the diversity of species , he said we ’re going to see " a kind of Cambrian explosion , and then a winnowing down of the tests out there , so that we have more tests that are reliable . " 
About Antibody tests : Antibody tests are useful because they can detect past infections , including mild or asymptomatic cases . 
That ’s important for researchers looking to understand how widespread the virus really is . 
The tests could also offer insight into who might have some protection against future infections , although it ’s unclear how long immunity might last . 
Only one coronavirus antibody test is currently authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
The agency , though , has released guidance allowing unauthorized antibody tests to be distributed during the pandemic .
