The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will tell Congress today he expects airplane passengers to wear a face mask when directed to by flight attendants , according to his prepared testimony shared by the FAA . 
Administrator Dickson â€™s testimony says the Transportation Department and FAA " expect the traveling public to follow airline crew directions and policies , which are in place for passenger protection and the health of air crews , and to take very seriously the precautions recommended by the CDC and the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) . " 
Neither the DOT nor FAA have made mask wearing in airports and on airplanes a federal requirement . 
Secretary Elaine Chao said recently she believes government regulation in this area would be too heavy handed and inflexible .
