Although there have been no widespread reports of adverse reactions nationwide , this marks the second in the same hospital system . 
It is unclear if there is any other connection between the two incidents . 
According to a statement from Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau : " A second staff member experienced eye puffiness , light headedness , and scratchy throat 10 minutes after being injected with the vaccine . " 
The hospital added that the reaction " was not considered anaphylaxis . " 
The statement added that the worker was taken to the emergency room and given epinephrine , Pepcid and Benadryl .

She had no known history of having any allergic reactions to vaccines , according to the hospital .
