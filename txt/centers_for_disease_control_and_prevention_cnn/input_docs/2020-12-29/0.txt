As of Tuesday , 19.88 million doses of the Covid 19 vaccine have been allocated to states , according to a tweet from the Health and Human Services Public Affairs Office . 
HHS said it reached that number by allocating 4.2 million doses that will be delivered in the first week of 2021 . 
Last week , Army Gen . Gustave Perna , chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed , said the US planned to allocate 20 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year . 
An allocation of vaccine is not a confirmed shipment . 
Instead , it is vaccine that has been allocated for states to be able to order , according to a senior administration official . 
Despite the allocations , the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that just over 11 million doses have been distributed , and only 2.1 million have actually been administered to people .
