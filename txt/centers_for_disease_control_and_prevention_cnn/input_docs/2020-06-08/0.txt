Every local situation is different . 
State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground , " she said . 
Earlier this week : CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for coronavirus . 
" We really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested , " Redfield said Thursday at a House Appropriations hearing on the Covid 19 response . 
" I do think there is a potential , unfortunately , for this to be a seeding event , " he said – especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission . 
Redfield also addressed the use of tear gas and similar chemical agents on protesters , saying these agents can cause people to cough -- which spreads respiratory viruses .
