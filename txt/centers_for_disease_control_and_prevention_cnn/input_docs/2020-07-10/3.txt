A gym owner filed a class action lawsuit against New York state Thursday arguing its business is " essential " and should be allowed to open as coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted . 
The suit seeks to represent about 2,500 fitness business owners , said attorney James Mermigis , who spoke at a news conference flanked by gym owners Wednesday before filing the suit . 
Mermigis said these businesses employ between 65,000 and 75,000 people across the state and that not being able to open means they have lost " hundreds of millions " in profits . 
The suit was filed in New York state court . 
Mermigis said that because New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo has said the state has some of the lowest infection rates in the country , it ’s time to open them . 
" I think gyms are very essential for your health , mind , body and soul . 
We think they ’re an important part of everyday living , " Mermigis . 
Jason Conwall , a spokesperson for Cuomo , said his office has not reviewed the suit but that the actions taken by the governor were intended to , and did , curb the rise of infection in the state , and allowed the state to avoid subsequent spikes of infection . 
" Reports show that infections are spiking in 38 states , and that officials in those states have been forced to reclose businesses and other parts of the economy that were opened too early , " Conwall said in a statement to CNN . 
" Every public opinion survey has shown an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers support our re opening approach . 
I understand some people are not happy – but better unhappy than sick or worse . " 
The suit claims that the named plaintiff , Thousand Islands Fitness center , and other gyms in the state , have " conformed " their fitness centers to adhere to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines , as gyms in other states that have been allowed to reopen have done .
