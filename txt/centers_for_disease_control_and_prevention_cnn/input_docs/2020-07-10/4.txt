New coronavirus antibody testing data suggests there to be large disparities among neighborhoods hit hardest by the pandemic across New York City , separated by race and class — but more research is needed to confirm the extent of the differences . 
Data from City MD urgent care medical clinics show that more than 68 % of people tested positive for antibodies at a clinic in the working class neighborhood of Corona , Queens , and 56 % tested positive at another clinic in Jackson Heights , Queens . 
Yet only 13 % of people tested positive for antibodies at a clinic in Cobble Hill , a mostly white and wealthy neighborhood in Brooklyn . 
The data were first reported in The New York Times on Thursday and a spokesperson for City MD confirmed to CNN in an email on Friday that " it 's accurate . " 
Even though the majority of people tested in those clinics had antibodies , that data do not reflect how many people in the neighborhoods themselves may have antibodies — because some patients in the clinics may not live in the neighborhoods where the clinics are located . 
Overall , nationwide data has been clear that Black and Brown communities across the United States have experienced higher rates of hospitalization or death from Covid 19 than White communities . 
As of June 12 , hospitalization rates among Black and American Indian or Alaska Native people were about five times that of White people , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Hispanic or Latino people have a rate about four times that of White people .
