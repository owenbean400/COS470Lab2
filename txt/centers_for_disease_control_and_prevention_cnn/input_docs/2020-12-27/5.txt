" We ’re very concerned and we always see a little bit of a bump after holidays , and sometimes a large bump , " US Surgeon General , Dr . Jerome Adams , said on ABC ’s This Week on Sunday , when asked about concerns about a post holiday surge of Covid 19 and the number of people who traveled . 
Adams noted the CDC recommendations that people get tested three to five days after travel or after being around people without masks being worn . 
" Getting that test now means that if you were exposed to asymptomatic spread from someone else , we can find out and we can limit your ability to spread to others , " Adams said . 
He also said that " you should definitely stay away from vulnerable people , " over the next fourteen days if you traveled , " so you do not give them coronavirus from your holiday gathering . "
