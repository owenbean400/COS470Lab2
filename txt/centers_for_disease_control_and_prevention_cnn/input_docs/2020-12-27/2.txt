Former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration Dr . Scott Gottlieb said on Sunday that the idea of getting 20 million vaccinations administered by the end of the year is probably unrealistic at this point , when asked what he thought about the pace of Covid 19 vaccination by CBS ’s Margaret Brennan . 
On Saturday , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 9,547,925 vaccine doses had been distributed and 1,944,585 had been administered . 
Gottlieb said that he suspected more than a million people have been vaccinated and that there is a lag in reporting , " but the idea that we ’re going to get 20 million vaccinations by the end of the year , that ’s probably unrealistic at this point . " 
Gottlieb said to remember that this was after only about 45 % of vaccines were shipped to states . 
" I think they ’ll get up and running and get better systems in place to distribute these vaccines more efficiently , I think they ’re going to turn to CVS and Walgreens to start distributing them in the community and that ’s a pretty big footprint , " he said . 
" But again , as you get out into the community and try to vaccinate a harder to reach population , it ’s going to become significantly more difficult to get those vaccines out . " 
The fact that there was a struggle to vaccinate health care workers and nursing home patients , " that shows we need to be investing more in these efforts , " Gottlieb said .
