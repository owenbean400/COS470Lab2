The Transportation Security Administration says it screened 1,128,773 people at airports nationwide on Saturday , the latest sign traveling public is not staying home for the holidays despite warnings from health officials . 
The new number is close to Wednesday ’s pandemic record when nearly 1.2 million people flew — and represents the third busiest day for US air travel since it cratered in March . 
While Saturday TSA traffic was 45 % of the day after Christmas a year ago , it means many people are still traveling — something Dr . Anthony Fauci called " concerning " when speaking to Wolf Blitzer last week . 
Earlier this month , the CDC ratcheted up language urging people to not travel .
