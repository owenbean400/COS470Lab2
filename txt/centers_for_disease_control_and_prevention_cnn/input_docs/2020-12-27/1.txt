Passengers arriving in the United States from the United Kingdom must test negative for Covid 19 before departure , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday . 
Passengers will be required to have a negative PCR or antigen test within 72 hours of boarding their flight . 
Passengers are also required to provide documentation of their laboratory results , either as a hard copy or electronic . 
Airlines are required to confirm the test results before the flight , and passengers will not be permitted to board if they refuse a test or do not provide documentation . 
The order is in response to a new coronavirus variant that is said to have originated in the UK and is potentially more transmissible . 
Since the discovery of the variant , more than 40 countries have restricted travel from the UK , and in some cases , also travel from other countries that have documented cases with the variant . 
The agency said the order will be signed Friday and go into effect on Monday . 
Genetics experts have expressed preliminary concerns that the Covid 19 vaccines might have less efficacy against this new variant . 
Pfizer and Moderna are testing their vaccines to see if they work against the new variant . 
The UK coronavirus variant has not been identified through genetic sequencing efforts in the US , the CDC said Tuesday . 
But that may be because the US surveillance system is not catching it . 
" It could be in the United States , and we might not have yet detected it , " Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir said Monday . 
Here 's what we know and do not know about the UK Covid 19 variant .
