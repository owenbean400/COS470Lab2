The safest way to celebrate the new year during the pandemic is at home with the people you live with , or online with friends and family , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in guidance posted to its website on Wednesday . 
For those who host a celebration , the CDC suggests staying outside , limiting the number of guests , making extra masks available and keeping background music low to avoid shouting . 
When attending a celebration , the agency says masks should be worn indoors and outdoors , people should stand at least 6 feet apart , avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces , and washing hands regularly , and alcohol and drugs that can alter judgement should be avoided . 
" While it is possible that some people may receive Covid 19 vaccines before New Year ’s Eve , continue taking steps to protect yourself and others for some time to come , " the CDC says . 
" It ’s okay if you decide to postpone or cancel your gathering . 
Do what ’s best for you , " the guidance says . 
Holiday travel may also increase a person ’s chance of getting and spreading Covid 19 , and CDC continues to recommend postponing travel .
