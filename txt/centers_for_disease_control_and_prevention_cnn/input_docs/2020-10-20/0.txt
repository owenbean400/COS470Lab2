More Hispanic workers were impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in food processing and manufacturing plants and agriculture workplaces in the US last spring than workers of other races or ethnicities , a team led by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday . 
A survey of meat and poultry plants and similar settings across the US found that nearly 73 % of people diagnosed with coronavirus were Hispanic or Latino , 6.3 % were Black and 4.1 % were Asian or Pacific Islander . 
Yet Hispanics make up only 37 % of the work force in these work places . 
This suggests " Hispanic or Latino , non Hispanic Black , and non Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander workers in these workplaces might be disproportionately affected by COVID 19 , " the researchers wrote in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases . 
The CDC examined information collected from state health departments about workers with confirmed Covid 19 in food processing and manufacturing plants and agricultural settings between March 1 and May 31 . 
They found reports on mass testing in US meat and poultry plants revealed widespread coronavirus outbreaks and found high numbers of asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections . 
High density workplaces can cause a higher risk for transmission of Covid 19 , the researchers reported . 
Only 36 states reported data and testing strategies varied by workplace so that influenced the number of cases detected , the CDC said . 
Workers hesitant to report illness could have led to an underestimation of cases .
