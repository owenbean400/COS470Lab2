The United States has seen nearly 300,000 excess deaths so far since late January â€“ and the groups with the biggest jumps in excess deaths , percentage wise , have been adults ages 25 to 44 and Hispanic people , according to a report published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The report included mortality data from Jan . 26 through Oct . 3 , to help researchers measure how many more people died this year during the coronavirus pandemic than otherwise would have been expected . 
" Although more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups , relative to past years , adults aged 25-44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3 , " the researchers wrote . 
" Among racial and ethnic groups , the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons ( 11.9 % ) and the largest for Hispanic persons ( 53.6 % ) . " 
The report has some limitations , including that mortality data can lag , and estimates of how many deaths would otherwise be expected are based on models .
