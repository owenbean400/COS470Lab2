Coronavirus patients are more likely to suffer complications and to die in the hospital than flu patients are , according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday . 
Covid 19 patients were almost 19 times more likely to experience acute respiratory distress syndrome , twice as likely to need intensive care and five times more likely to die than flu patients , according to national Veterans Health Administration data from more than 9,000 patients with either Covid 19 or influenza . 
Hospital stays were almost three times longer for coronavirus patients , and nearly a quarter of these patients had complications involving three or more organ systems . 
The CDC led research team found they were at increased risk for 17 health complications . 
Coronavirus patients had twice the risk of pneumonia , a type of heart inflammation called myocarditis ; blood clots known as deep vein thrombosis as well as pulmonary embolism ; brain hemorrhage and liver failure . 
Flu patients were more likely to experience worsened asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 
While coronavirus patients were slightly older , on average , flu patients had more underlying health conditions . 
About 48 % of coronavirus patients and 25 % of flu patients were Black . 
The researchers found that coronavirus patients who were not White were at greater risk for respiratory , neurologic , and kidney complications and sepsis , even after adjusting for outside factors . 
They say this underscores a disproportionate impact of Covid 19 on racial and ethnic minority groups â€“ one that cannot be explained just by age or underlying medical conditions . 
The patients included in the study tested positive for coronavirus between March 1 and May 31 , or for flu between Oct . 1 and Feb . 1 . 
The researchers set those time frames to avoid including patients who were infected with both coronavirus and flu .
