A federal health official tells CNN that teams from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being sent to the eight states – New Mexico , Wyoming , Idaho , Alaska , North Dakota , Kentucky , West Virginia and Ohio — to bolster contact tracing efforts in order to help contain Covid 19 . 
Contact tracing is widely considered to be necessary to have in place in order to reopen the economy . 
The health official said the teams will be " testing new technologies , " including " having people do self swabbing and evaluating how effective that is . 
They are also looking at some mobile technology to look at contact tracing . " 
Some states will have specialized epidemiology studies performed in nursing facilities . 
CNN previously reported these teams were also being sent to help homeless and prison populations in some states . 
The goal of the CDC teams will be to expand testing " and try and help those states remain at low levels of transmission , " the official previously told CNN . 
The agency has not officially announced the new " Community Protection Initiative " program . 
Among the eight states , Wyoming announced Tuesday the CDC would be sending it approximately five people as part of the program . 
And New Mexico said Wednesday it had been approached to be a part of it . 
CNN has reached out to the states for comment .
