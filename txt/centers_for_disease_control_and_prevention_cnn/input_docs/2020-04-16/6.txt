As part of his unveiling of new reopening guidelines , President Trump is expected to announce Thursday a new effort to bolster contact tracing in states , according to a person familiar with the plans . 
The effort will include the hiring of hundreds of staffers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to perform tracing in states and helping states pay for new teams to contact people who have tested positive to see who they have interacted with . 
The effort is meant to prevent new outbreaks in places as they begin to reopen . 
The new workers would supplement existing contact tracing efforts in state and local health departments . 
Health experts , including Dr . Anthony Fauci , have cited contact tracing — along with testing and isolating cases — as essential to reopening efforts . 
Earlier , CNN reported that teams from the CDC are being sent to the eight states — New Mexico , Wyoming , Idaho , Alaska , North Dakota , Kentucky , West Virginia and Ohio — to bolster contact tracing efforts in order to help contain Covid 19 .
