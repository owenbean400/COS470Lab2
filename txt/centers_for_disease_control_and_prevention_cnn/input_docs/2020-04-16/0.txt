A total of 141 people who had apparently recovered from Covid 19 have tested positive again , South Korea 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) said on Thursday . 
KCDC deputy director Kwon Joon wook said the agency did not know what caused the people to retest positive and was investigating . 
Most experts think it 's unlikely that somebody will be re infected for the coronavirus soon after recovering . 
It 's possible that issues with testing – or varying amounts of viral RNA in the body , which the tests look for – could explain why people tested positive after testing negative . 
Kwon also said that the government is studying cultivated samples from the patients to determine whether the cases could be contagious . 
Kwon said the study will take about two weeks from today . 
" Our KCDC workers are working day and night to collect samples and conduct studies , " Kwon said .
