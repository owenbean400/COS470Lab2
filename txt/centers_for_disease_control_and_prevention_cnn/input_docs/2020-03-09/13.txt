According to an update to the CDC ’s website , Washington , D.C . , is also able to test for the virus . 
The CDC site lists Guam , Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands as in process to test . 
" The number of commercially available tests is much larger than that and our expectation within the next couple weeks , as more and more commercial entities come on board , is that the majority of the available testing will actually be from the commercial sector , " Messonnier said .
