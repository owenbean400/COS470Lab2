A top official with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday she expects " many people " will be exposed to the novel coronavirus — but far fewer will become severely ill . 
" It ’s fair to say that , as the trajectory of the outbreak continues , many people in the United States will at some point in time , either this year or next , be exposed to this virus . 
And there ’s a good chance many will become sick , " Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of CDC 's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , told reporters today . 
" But again , based on what we know about this virus , we do not expect most people to develop serious illness , " she added , citing figures from China suggesting roughly 80 % of cases were mild . 
However , Messonnier said that risk starts to increase beginning at age 60 , with those over 80 at highest risk of serious illness from the virus . 
" The people who are at greatest risk are those who are older , and who also have serious , long term health conditions like diabetes , heart disease or lung disease , " she said . 
In guidance released last week , the CDC encouraged those at higher risk to stock up on supplies , avoid crowds and " stay home as much as possible " if there ’s an outbreak in your community . 
Still , Messonnier added today that there 's no evidence of community transmission in most parts of the US . 
" I would recommend that people make their own decisions based on an understanding of that risk , " she said .
