A second Florida cruise ship has been issued a " no sail " order following coronavirus concerns . 
The Caribbean Princess has received a temporary " no sail " order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the agency learned that two crew members transferred from another ship that previously had at least one guest test positive for coronavirus , according to Princess Cruises . 
One crew member transferred more than two weeks ago and the second crew member transferred more than 10 days ago . Both crew members are showing no symptoms and are remaining in their single occupancy staterooms . 
The Caribbean Princess departed Port Everglades on a 10 day Panama Canal , Costa Rica and Caribbean voyage on March 1 and is currently scheduled to end on March 11 , per Princess Cruises . 
Now , the Caribbean Princess will make a brief stop at Grand Cayman for test kits and then set sail for Florida . 
The ship is expected to remain anchored off the coast of Florida until the " no sail " order is lifted by the CDC . 
This is the second ship to be held off the coast of Florida . 
The Regal Princess was held under similar circumstances on Sunday . 
Two crew members on that ship were tested for coronavirus and after the tests came back negative , the ship was allowed to dock and passengers were allowed to disembark .
