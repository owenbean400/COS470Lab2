More than two dozen House Democrats sent a letter Tuesday urging congressional leaders to include provisions to boost mask use in the United States in the next round of coronavirus stimulus . 
In a letter led by Rep . 
Ro Khanna and Rep . 
Adam Schiff , the lawmakers requested that Congress provide free masks to all Americans , funding for a CDC public service announcement campaign about masks , and provisions for research into " mask efficacy and optimal design . " 
They said the masks could be distributed by the US Postal Service and made accessible at convenient pick up locations around the country . 
" While nothing short of a vaccine or a cure can truly end the threat of this virus , we must aggressively pursue simple and affordable courses of action that can mitigate infections and save tens of thousands of lives , " they argued .
