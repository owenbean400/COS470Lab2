When asked if the state of Maryland is running low on coronavirus testing kits , Charles Gischlar , the deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health , said " there are still testing challenges occurring in the state , although private labs and medical facilities have ramped up testing . " 
The Maryland Department of Health Lab can process about 500 tests a day and process priority group Covid 19 tests seven days a week . 
In accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance , priority groups for testing are symptomatic health care workers and first responders ; symptomatic people over age 65 and those who live in nursing homes and other types of group housing ; and those who are symptomatic and medically unstable for whom their health care provider has determined a test is necessary to manage their medical condition , Gischlar said .
