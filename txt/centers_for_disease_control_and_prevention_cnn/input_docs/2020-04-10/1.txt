The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday that about half of all US deaths have been reported in two states : New York and New Jersey . 
The CDC ’s numbers lag behind those maintained by other sources , such as Johns Hopkins University , but the agency on Friday released a detailed report outlining the geographic distribution of coronavirus in the US . 
New York City has had the highest " cumulative incidence " of reported cases , with 915.3 cases per 100,000 people , according to the CDC . 
Minnesota had the lowest incidence , at 20.6 cases per 100,000 people . 
Some context : A variety of factors could explain why some regions have more cases and deaths , the CDC said . 
Differences in population density , age distribution and the prevalence of underlying medical conditions among Covid 19 patients could be factors , according to the agency . 
The variation between regions could also reflect differences in when coronavirus was first introduced into a population . 
And the timing and extent of community mitigation measures could also be at play , according to the agency . 
The CDC also said that differences in testing capacity – and public health reporting practices – could be factors . 
The agency cautioned , however , that its report has limitations . 
Case counts are likely " underestimated " because of incomplete detection of cases and delays in reporting , according to the CDC . 
And deaths are also likely to be underreported , the agency said , because people might die from the virus without receiving a Covid 19 diagnosis .
