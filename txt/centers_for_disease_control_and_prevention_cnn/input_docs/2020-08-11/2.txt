The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has released three sets of guidance to help companies meet increased demand for hand sanitizer during the Covid 19 pandemic . 
" Hand hygiene is an important part of the U.S . response to Covid 19 , " the FDA website says . 
" If soap and water are not readily available , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) recommends consumers use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol . " 
Provided that they follow the FDA guidance , companies that are not currently registered drug manufacturers can register as over the counter drug manufacturers to make alcohol based hand sanitizers during the pandemic . 
Pharmacies and registered outsourcing facilities can also compound certain alcohol based hand sanitizers , and alcohol production firms can produce alcohol for making hand sanitizer . 
The three sets of guidance provide a list of specific ingredients that should be used in production , considerations for testing and other guidance in areas of production such as preparation and labelling . 
The FDA recommends that the public check any hand sanitizer in their home , as well as any that they plan to buy , against its list of products that are potentially contaminated with methanol .
