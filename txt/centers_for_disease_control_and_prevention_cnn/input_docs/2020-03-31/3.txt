President Trump defended the ability of the US to conduct tests for coronavirus , despite medical workers saying they cannot test everyone who needs one . 
Vice President Mike Pence later attempted to clarify why there is a discrepancy in the amount of tests that the administration said had been distributed and the amount of tests that have been conducted . 
Pence said under the old testing system , tests were being sent out , but had to be returned to labs that could only tests a small number per day . 
" I think that the misunderstanding early on was that there are many tests being distributed , many test kits being sent , but under the old system , the antiquated system those were being processed in state labs or at CDC that could only produce 30 to 50 tests a day , " Pence said . 
Dr . Deborah Birx , the task force response coordinator , also said she ’s disappointed that Abbott Laboratories coronavirus test disbursed around the country are not being utilized . 
" It is disappointing to me right now that we have about 500,000 capacity of Abbott tests that are not being utilized . 
So , they are out . 
They ’re in the states . 
They ’re not being run and not utilized . 
And now we have to figure out how do we create awareness , " Birx said during the briefing Tuesday .
