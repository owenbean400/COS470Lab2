The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to monitor data around the coronavirus pandemic and could put out new recommendations on the use of face masks â€” if the guidance warrants , US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said during an appearance on " Fox & Friends " today . 
As of now , Adams said there is not enough data to recommend that the public wear masks . 
Currently , the World Health Organization and CDC both recommend to wear masks only if you are sick or are caring for someone who is sick . 
" What the World Health Organization and the CDC have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear masks . 
Here 's why : On an individual level , there was a study in 2015 looking at medical students -- and medical students wearing surgical masks touch their face on average 23 times , " Adams said . 
Earlier this month , Adams urged Americans to stop buying masks , tweeting " They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching # Coronavirus , but if healthcare providers ca not get them to care for sick patients , it puts them and our communities at risk ! " 
Today , Adams reiterated that masks need to be saved for health care workers . 
When it was brought up that masks are widely used in China , Adams responded , " They have a culture there of wearing masks and everyone already has one and they 're more accustomed to wearing them without touching their faces . " 
" We know a major way that you can get respiratory diseases like coronaviruses is by touching a surface and then touching your face , " Adams added . 
" So wearing a mask improperly can actually increase your risk of getting disease . "
