While they may be unpopular in some places , mask mandates work to slow the spread of Covid 19 , according to new research published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Since Covid 19 spreads predominantly through respiratory droplets , wearing a mask can protect others from the person wearing the mask who may have Covid 19 . 
This month , the CDC released guidance that said masks can protect the wearer , too , by filtering incoming infectious droplets . 
On July 2 , as Covid 19 cases were surging in the state , Kansas Gov . 
Laura Kelly signed an executive order that made masks mandatory in public spaces . 
The majority of the state 's counties , 81 , opted out of this executive order , but 24 opted in or created their own mask mandate . 
The counties that did require masks account for two thirds of Kansas ' population . 
The CDC and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment looked at the Covid 19 case trends between June 1 and July 2 , before the mandate , and then July 3 to August 23 , after the mandate , to compare what happened . 
In the 24 counties that required people to wear masks in public , there was a net decrease of 6 % in cases ; whereas the disease continued to surge in the counties without the mandate . 
In those counties , the net increase in cases was 100 % .
