High risk groups will receive a coronavirus vaccine first , according to the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices . 
People such as health care providers , hospital employees and nursing home residents will be vaccinated before the larger US population , Dr . Jose Romero said to CNN ’s Michael Smerconish in an interview . 
" Our focus is on the high risk groups at this moment , " said Romero , who is also the Arkansas secretary of health . 
Romero said people who have been vaccinated will be tracked . 
There is " wiggle room " for different states in deploying a vaccine , Romero said . 
" States may prioritize individuals as they feel important , due to local issues . 
For the most part , ACIP recommendations are followed , so , I think that states will adhere to the recommendations , " he said . 
Romero said he does have some concern that people will not take a vaccine even when it is ready and safe to do so . 
" We know that there is some reluctance for accepting a new vaccine among different population groups — it can be as high as 50 % , depending on the surveys . 
… I want to stress that the issue of safety of the vaccine has been paramount throughout the process , " he said .
