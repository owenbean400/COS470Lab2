The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidance on holiday gatherings and what Americans need to be aware of before traveling , hosting or attending parties — or just gathering with family and friends over the Thanksgiving holiday . 
Here 's a look at what the CDC describes as low risk holiday activities : The lowest risk for contracting the highly infectious virus or spreading it is simply celebrating Thanksgiving in your own home with members of your household and/or virtually with extended family , the CDC said . 
People can prepare holiday food for non household family members — especially those at higher risk of contracting Covid 19 , and neighbors — and deliver it without contact . 
They can also host a virtual dinner as a means of mitigating any risk . 
Shopping online instead of heading to malls and stores for holiday sales the weekend after Thanksgiving is a safer way of grabbing those deals . 
The CDC suggests watching sports events , parades or movies from home as another low risk holiday activity .
