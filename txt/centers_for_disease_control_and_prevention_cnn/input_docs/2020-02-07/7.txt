Twenty three cruise ship passengers were cleared , and four are being evaluated at an area hospital after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention boarded the ship today in Bayonne , New Jersey . 
The officials were there to screen the 27 passengers who recently traveled from mainland China , according to the New Jersey governor Phil Murphy . 
The Royal Caribbean cruise ship , " The Anthem of the Seas , " docked this morning in the Port of Bayonne . 
" New Jersey currently has no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and the risk to residents remains low , " Murphy said in a statement . 
A spokesperson for the CDC previously said the agency is aware of two family members on board the Anthem of the Seas cruise ship who became ill on board . 
The family has a travel history to mainland China , but not a history of travel to Hubei Province â€” the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak . 
CDC staff consulted with the New Jersey Department of Health and have decided to test all four family members for the novel coronavirus out of an abundance of caution . 
The New Jersey Department of Health will facilitate the specimen collection , and the samples will be sent to CDC for testing .
