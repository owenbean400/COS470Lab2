The United States Health and Human Services Department said Monday it is delivering $ 11 billion in new funding to states and territories to help them test people for coronavirus . 
Most of the money will be distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , while the Indian Health Service ( IHS ) will allocate $ 750 million to IHS , tribal , and urban Indian health programs . 
The money comes out of the $ 484 billion coronavirus relief bill . 
HHS said each governor would submit plans for Covid 19 testing . 
It â€™s been promising details of how the $ 11 billion would be split for a week . 
The background : The US has struggled with testing capacity , in part because the first test created by the CDC did not work . 
According to data collated by Johns Hopkins University , the US has conducted more than 11.8 million coronavirus tests .
