Health officials have yet to label the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic — but they could be close to calling it one . 
" We 're on the knife 's edge , " said Dr . William Schaffner , an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" We 're really on the brink , " says Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes for Health . 
There is no precise , mathematical definition of a pandemic . 
Outbreaks get characterized as pandemics by epidemiologists — who are not yet using the term . 
So why are not epidemiologists labeling this a pandemic yet ? 
It ’s because they 've yet to see sustained transmission among people who have not recently traveled to China or had close contact with someone who recently traveled to China . 
It 's not enough for a cluster of disease in a country to exist and even spread — it has to spread in a sustained way , from person to person , time and time again , through many generations of transmission . 
Right now , certain countries may still be able to contain the clusters of disease they are experiencing , and if they snuff out the outbreaks before they progress and achieve sustained transmission , they will have avoided a pandemic .
