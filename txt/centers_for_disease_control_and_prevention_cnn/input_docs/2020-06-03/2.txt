ER visits during the pandemic for non Covid emergencies have dropped 42 % across the United States , when compared to this same time last year , according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 
The new research published on Wednesday found that emergency department visits drastically fell from about 2.1 million visits per week between March 31 and April 27 last year , to 1.2 million between March 29 and April 25 this year . 
The " steepest decreases " were among children 14 and younger , women and girls , and people living in the Northeast region of the country , CDC researchers noted in the report . 
Yet overall , " the proportion of infectious disease related visits was four times higher during the early pandemic period , " according to the report . 
In the report , CDC recommended for people to keep using virtual doctor 's visits and triage help lines during the pandemic , but not to hesitate seeking care for serious conditions , such as heart attack . 
The research had some limitations , including that the number of hospitals reporting to National Syndromic Surveillance Program change over time ; the data do not capture all US hospitals , just those who reported to the surveillance program ; and the data is limited to emergency department visits only , so people who may have sought treatment elsewhere are not captured in the data .
