Two of US President Donald Trump 's top officials are now pointing the finger at the administration 's own scientists and Americans ' pre existing health conditions to explain the country 's world leading Covid 19 death toll . 
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar suggested Sunday that underlying health conditions , including among minorities , were one reason for the high American death toll -- nearly 90,000 as of Sunday evening . 
And Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro added the government 's own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to its list of scapegoats alongside China and the Obama administration . 
The White House has been escalating its effort to recast the narrative of its own chaotic response to the crisis as it aggressively pushes to reopen the country , a process vital to the fortunes of millions of people who have lost their jobs in lockdowns and its own political prospects in November . 
The effort follows Trump 's repeated early denials that the virus would be a problem for the United States and claims that his administration had it under control months ago . 
The US accounts for about 4.25 % of the world 's population , but currently has about 29 % of the confirmed deaths from the disease , and models used by the White House suggest the tragic toll could rise to around 147,000 by early August .
