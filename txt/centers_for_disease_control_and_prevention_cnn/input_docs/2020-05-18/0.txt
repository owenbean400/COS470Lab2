More than 100 coronavirus infections in South Korea have been linked to a fitness instructor workshop from mid February , researchers have found . 
The infections are not recent -- they were all identified by March 9 -- but the new research offers insight into how rapidly coronavirus can spread in enclosed spaces . 
What happened : Almost 30 instructors participated in the original workshop , which was held in Cheonan , South Korea . 
They trained intensely for four hours , and while none had symptoms at the time , eight instructors eventually tested positive for the virus . 
More cases uncovered : Less than a month later , researchers had identified 112 coronavirus cases linked to dance classes in a dozen different facilities . 
Half of the cases were the result of direct transmission from instructors to students , and some people went on to infect others outside of class . 
Why did the virus spread this way ? 
Several factors may have made it easier for the virus to spread , according to Sukbin Jang and colleagues at the Dankook University College of Medicine in Cheonan . 
They published their findings in Emerging Infectious Diseases , a journal from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Classes linked to transmission had five to 22 students and took place in small spaces for almost an hour . 
Out of 217 students exposed to infected instructors , 57 of them -- about one in four -- ended up testing positive .
