The United States remains in the first wave of the Covid 19 pandemic , since cases never declined significantly to a good baseline , says Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's leading infectious disease expert . 
The idea of a second wave is based on the pattern seen during the 1918 pandemic , when cases were seen in the spring and then cases " literally disappeared " before there was an " explosion " of cases in the fall , Fauci said . 
That challenge could include surges of Covid 19 cases across the country as more fronts open up , including the many schools and colleges nationwide that have welcomed students back to class . 
And as the weather gets cooler , more gatherings will move inside , where the virus can spread more easily . 
There 's also a potentially complicated flu season on its way that could pile on top of the pandemic and quickly overwhelm the healthcare system . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director has warned it could be a historically difficult fall and winter . 
Across the US , more than 6.9 million people have already been infected with the virus . 
CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield said this week more than 90 % of the population remains susceptible to the virus . 
At least 202,000 Americans have died . 
As of early Friday morning , 23 states across the country 's heartland and Midwest reported an increase of new cases compared to the previous week , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
About 16 states were trekking steady . 
Eleven states saw a decline -- Arizona , Connecticut , Delaware , Hawaii , Indiana , Maryland , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Vermont and Virginia .
