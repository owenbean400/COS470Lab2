US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield said state and local public health labs are underequipped and understaffed . 
" The truth is we 've not invested , we 've underinvested in the public health labs , " Redfield said at a House Appropriations hearing for the 2021 CDC budget . 
" There 's not enough equipment , there 's not enough people , there 's not enough internal capacity , there 's no surge capacity , " Redfield added . 
" Public health labs , we built the technology in those labs to monitor flu , that uses a certain equipment , which we call thermocycler , that equipment , maybe a good lab could do 300 tests a day . 
University of Washington can use these high machines , like New York is about to do , those machines can do thousands , and thousands and thousands , " Redfield said . 
Redfield also said that 99 % of the novel coronavirus cases recently confirmed were outside of China . 
According to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization , which were released on Monday , there were 3,948 new cases outside China and 45 new cases in China - - roughly 1 % . 
" The epicenter , the new China is Europe . 
And there ’s a lot of people coming back and forth from Europe . 
We ’re starting to see these communities and we are moving quickly to understand how address Europe , " Redfield said .
