Most viruses do not spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says . 
Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50 % of the air in the cabin , mixed with outside air . 
" The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20--30 times per hour , " the CDC says . 
" Furthermore , air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft , thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small particle aerosols . 
As a result , the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases . " 
Still , try to avoid contact with anyone sneezing or coughing . 
And if you 're feeling sick , cover your entire mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze .
