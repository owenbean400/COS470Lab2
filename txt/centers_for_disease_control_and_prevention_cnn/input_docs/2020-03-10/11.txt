US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says his department is not sure how many tests for the novel coronavirus have been performed in the United States . 
" We 're working with the CDC and those partners to get an IT reporting system up and running hopefully this week where we would be able to get that data to keep track of how many we 're testing , " he added . 
Azar went on to say : " We think we 've got probably 10,000 a day could be getting tested by the end of the week -- 20,000 a day according to a study by AEI that I 've heard about . 
We 've got 2.1 million tests available , 1.1 million have shipped . 
We actually have a surplus at the moment that are awaiting orders to be shipped . " 
" A private vendor shipped most of those 1.1 million that shipped were from a private vendor selling to their customers , and those entities that used their tests do not have to report back to CDC . 
But we 're trying to set up a reporting system where they would in effect do that , " Azar said .
