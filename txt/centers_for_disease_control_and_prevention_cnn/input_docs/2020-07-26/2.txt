Admiral Brett Giroir , a member of the White House â€™s Coronavirus task force , told CNN that there is no one size fits all when it comes to reopening schools . 
New US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on education and child care favor the opening schools , saying children do not suffer much from coronavirus , are less likely than adults to spread it and suffer from being out of school . 
But the new guidelines posted Thursday do recommend that local officials should consider closing schools , or keeping them closed , if there is substantial , uncontrolled transmission of the virus . 
The CDC has been promising new guidelines for more than a week , after demands from President Trump that the agency alter its recommendations for opening schools .
