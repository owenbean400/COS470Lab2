Former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr . Tom Frieden , highlighted the importance of trust in the vaccine process on Sunday . 
First , experts have to see if vaccines work , and there is encouraging news that some might , Frieden said . 
Then , it 's necessary to make sure the vaccines are safe . 
Thirdly , " we have to make sure we get them into people ’s arms and that means ensuring that there ’s trust , he said . 
He said that two crucial things to watch are the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC ’s Public Advisory Committee , describing both as transparent and open to the public . 
The FDA determines approval of the vaccine , and the CDC approves who should get it and when , Frieden explained . 
" There are no secrets here , it ’s very important that we maintain , gain , increase trust in this whole process or people are going to be confused , concerned and they ’re not going to take the vaccine , " he said . 
When it comes to a timeline for vaccine availability , Frieden said that there may be signals that the vaccine is protective sometime in the fall , and that there may be announcements from companies that they can make large quantities , " but between knowing it ’s safe , effective and available , that ’s going to be sometime next year , in all likelihood , if we are lucky .
