The deadly coronavirus may have circulated in the United States as early as December , about a month earlier than believed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , according to researchers with UCLA . 
Their study , published last Thursday in the Journal of Medical Internet Research , found a statistically significant increase in clinic and hospital visits by patients who reported respiratory illnesses as early as the week of December 22 . 
The first known case of Covid 19 in the US was thought to be a patient in Washington who had visited Wuhan , China , according to the CDC . 
The case was reported in January . 
Dr . Joann Elmore and colleagues looked through nearly 10 million medical records from the UCLA Health system , including three hospitals and 180 clinics . 
Elmore said she started the search after receiving a number of emails from anxious patients in March through her clinic 's patient portal at UCLA . 
Patients kept asking if the cough they had in January could have been Covid 19 .
