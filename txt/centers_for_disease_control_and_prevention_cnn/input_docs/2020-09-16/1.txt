Children and teens from minority groups are disproportionately hit by coronavirus , just as older adults are , according to the findings of a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Children from ethnic and racial minorities , those with underlying health conditions and those between the ages of 18 and 20 are more likely to die , a CDC led research team wrote in a study published Tuesday in the agency 's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . 
The report also showed just how unusual it is for children and young adults to die from coronavirus . 
Among the 190,000 deaths tallied in the country , only 0.08 % -- or 121 -- were reported in those under 21 . 
The most updated report from the CDC shows 377 children , teens and young adults aged up to 24 have died from coronavirus . 
The researchers asked 50 states , New York City , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico , Guam , and the US Virgin Islands to submit information on coronavirus deaths in those under 21 , between February 12 and July 31 . 
Forty seven jurisdictions responded . 
Minorities at higher risk : Among the approximately 6.5 million Covid 19 cases in the country , the researchers found a total of 391,814 cases of Covid 19 and MIS C in those under 21 . 
While people under 21 make up 26 % of the US population , they make up only 8 % of all reported cases . 
Hispanics , Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives were disproportionately affected . 
A total of 44 % of the 121 who died were Hispanic children , 29 % were Black children , 4 % were American Indian/Alaska Natives and 4 % were Asian or Pacific Islander . 
While these groups represent 41 % of the US population under the age of 21 , they accounted for approximately 75 % of deaths in that age range . 
Fourteen percent of the deaths were in white children .
