Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that he thinks it will be the late second quarter or third quarter of 2021 before a Covid 19 vaccine is generally available to the American public . 
When asked when he thought there would be a vaccine ready to administer to the American public , Redfield said he thought that there would be vaccine initially available sometime between November and December , but " very limited supply and will have to be prioritized . " 
Redfield said that he thought the vaccination would begin in November and December " and then will pick up , and it will be in a prioritized way . 
It will be those first responders and those at greatest risk for death , and then eventually that will expand . "
