Federal documents released Wednesday provide new details about the government â€™s plan to distribute Covid 19 vaccines for free once approved or authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
He noted that vaccines being tested have different transport and storage requirement ; some require a second dose at 21 or 28 days after the first ; and some require different needles and syringes . 
" I think the message we want you to leave with is we are prepared for all of those uncertainties , " Mango said . 
Here are key things to know about the plan : Limited early supply A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine distribution playbook says that for planning purposes , state and local health agencies should assume " limited COVID 19 vaccine doses may be available by early November 2020 " if a vaccine is authorized or licensed by the FDA , but the supply may increase substantially in 2021 . 
The initial supply is expected to go to health care workers , other essential workers and people at higher risk for severe illness from Covid 19 . 
The US Department of Defense , CDC and some parts of HHS are coordinating the supply , production and distribution of vaccines . 
Vaccine administration sites may be limited early on to target particular populations and storage requirements . 
Later on , sites could expand to include pediatric and adult health care providers and pharmacies . 
IT infrastructure The effort requires extensive data monitoring to track vaccines , handle claims and payment , identify who needs a second a dose and to monitor outcomes and potential adverse events . 
Operation Warp Speed will construct and integrate IT architecture to meet these needs , according to the strategy document . 
Lt . 
Gen . Paul Ostrowski from Operation Warp Speed said during the briefing Wednesday that databases to track vaccines already exist at state and pharmacy levels . 
" The hard part is being able to get the databases to talk with one another , " he said , for example , so that he could get a vaccine at a public health center and then get the correct second dose weeks later , perhaps at a pharmacy in a different location . 
Cost On cost , the distribution strategy says the objective is " to ensure no one desiring vaccination will face an economic barrier to receiving one . " 
" The federal government is procuring hundreds of millions of doses of safe and effective vaccines , and has contracted with Mc Kesson for purposes of vaccine distribution , such that no American will be charged for either the COVID 19 vaccine or its distribution , " the strategy document says . 
Vaccine information campaign The strategy document says an information campaign led by HHS public affairs " will focus on vaccine safety and efficacy , and target key populations and communities to ensure maximum vaccine acceptance . " 
" Identifying the right messages to promote vaccine confidence , countering misinformation , and targeting outreach to vulnerable and at risk populations will be necessary to achieve high coverage , " it says .
