The US federal government said Wednesday it plans to stop limiting international arrivals from certain countries to 15 airports and funneling them through enhanced screening . 
Instead , passengers will be advised about risks . 
Screening for symptoms does not really help much because so many people do not have symptoms , the CDC said . 
" Transmission of the virus may occur from passengers who have no symptoms or who have not yet developed symptoms of infection . 
Therefore , CDC is shifting its strategy and prioritizing other public health measures to reduce the risk of travel related disease transmission , " the agency said . 
It said resources will instead be dedicated to " more effective mitigation efforts " focused on individuals . 
These will include " pre departure , in flight , and post arrival health education for passengers ; robust illness response at airports ; voluntary collection of contact information from passengers using electronic means , " the CDC said . 
That should help reduce crowding and lines , it said . 
Testing may also be an option , as well as reminding travelers to watch for symptoms and quarantine themselves as possible for 14 days .
