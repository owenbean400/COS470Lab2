De Wine said Butler County has specifically been affected by numbers influenced by Miami University , stating that between Sept . 2 and 8 , there were 545 student positive cases and the previous week , there were 495 cases . 
In addition to the Miami University student cases , De Wine said there have also been small outbreaks at workplaces and long term care facilities in Butler County . 
" Mercer County continues as red because they meet the CDC threshold for high incidence . 
Their number is 206 cases per hundred thousand . 
Their per case number sadly increased this past week from 179 last week to 206 this week , so we 've seen it coming down from Mercer County for a couple of weeks now we 're seeing it starting to go back up . 
Still a very high level Mercer County continues to see spread throughout the community . 
They 've had outbreaks at workplaces and long term care facilities and they 've got just pretty much spread throughout the county , " De Wine said . 
Wittenberg University in Springfield is contributing to the increased number of cases in the area with an increase of more than 70 new cases this week . 
These cases are being associated with out of class social gatherings . 
To help combat the spread the university announced on Sept . 9 , classes will be remote for two weeks .
