Adm . Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for Health at the US Department of Health and Human Services , underscored that asymptomatic people who think they â€™ve been exposed to Covid 19 should be tested for coronavirus , especially in outbreak areas . 
At the end of August , the CDC suggested asymptomatic people may not need to be tested for Covid 19 . 
Giroir said the intent was to get people tested under the supervision of public health or medical professionals and to deter any overconfidence that people may feel from a negative test . 
In hotspot areas , Giroir said " we need to test a lot . " 
" Trust me , we want to test asymptomatic people , because as you know and everyone knows , that you can have asymptomatic people who spread the virus . 
And indeed , that 's been the biggest issue with this , " Giroir said during a Research ! 
America forum .
