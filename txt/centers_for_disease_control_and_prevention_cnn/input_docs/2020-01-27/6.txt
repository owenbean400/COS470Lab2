Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , responded to a statement Sunday by the Chinese health minister Ma Xiaowei that people are infectious before they have symptoms of Wuhan coronavirus . 
" We at CDC do not have clear evidence that patients are infectious before symptom onset , but we are actively investigating that possibility , " she said . 
Messonnier said the risk to the American public for contracting this virus continues to be low . 
" We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic , but I continue to hope that it is not , " Messonnier said . 
The CDC confirmed Sunday there are five cases of Wuhan coronavirus in the United States – one in Arizona , two in California and two previously confirmed cases in Illinois and Washington . 
All five cases were in people who had recently traveled in Wuhan , China . 
The CDC has about 75 people still under investigation because they might have the virus , and about 25 others who were found not to have the virus . 
The CDC is the only lab in the United States that tests for the virus .
