China 's health minister Ma Xiaowei made a startling statement Sunday about the Wuhan coronavirus : He said people can spread it before they become symptomatic . 
" This is a game changer , " said Dr . William Schaffner , a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
It 's much harder to contain a virus -- to track down a patient 's contacts and quarantine them immediately -- if the patient was spreading the disease for days or weeks before they even realized they had it . 
" It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought , " said Schaffner , an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center . 
" This is worse than we anticipated . " 
Ma did not explain why he thinks the virus can be spread before someone has symptoms . 
If the Chinese health minister is right -- and there are those who doubt him -- that means the five confirmed cases in the United States might have been infectious while traveling from Wuhan to Arizona , California , Illinois and Washington state , even if they had no symptoms at the time .
