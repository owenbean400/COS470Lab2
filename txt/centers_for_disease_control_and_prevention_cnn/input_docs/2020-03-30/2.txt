Texas prison inmates are suing for hand sanitizer , soap and paper towels , alleging that their prison unit has not taken enough precautions to stop the spread of novel coronavirus , according to a new federal lawsuit . 
The lawsuit says both the Texas criminal justice system and the community around the Wallace Pack Unit in Grimes County have seen multiple reported cases of the novel coronavirus . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that jails make cleaning supplies , personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer available . 
The lawsuit alleges that Texas state inmates ca not get access to hand sanitizer because of state policy â€” even while some inmates have been forced to make it . 
The lawsuit also claims the prison has not taken enough steps to stop the virus from spreading , such as by reducing inmate interactions . 
So far , an inmate and two employees at other facilities in the Texas prison system have tested positive for coronavirus , the lawsuit said . 
A spokesperson for the Texas state prison system declined to comment on the lawsuit 's allegations because the state is still reviewing it . 
He also said the health practices at Texas correctional facilities are evolving , but did not give specifics . 
" The health and wellbeing of TDCJ employees and contractors as well as the offenders in our custody is of utmost importance . 
TDCJ is working in close contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Texas State Health officials , " Jeremy Desel said in an email Monday . 
" As guidance from the CDC and state health officials evolves so do our practices . "
