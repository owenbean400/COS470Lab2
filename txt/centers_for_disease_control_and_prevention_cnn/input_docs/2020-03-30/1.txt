Prince George â€™s County in Maryland has opened a screening facility at Fed Ex Field , the home of the Washington Redskins . 
County communications director Gina Ford said the screening site can handle 100 appointments a day for the three days a week it is open : Monday , Wednesday and Friday . 
Ford said that the hope is that as tests become more readily available , they will be able to add more days of testing . 
The screening is open to all , not just Maryland residents but no walk ups will be allowed . 
Everyone must receive an appointment from the hotline that has been set up for over the phone evaluation with medical staffers to make sure patient symptoms meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines . 
The site is being primarily run by the Prince George 's County Health Department but works with the help of the Maryland Department of Health , the Maryland National Guard , the Maryland Medical Reserve Corps and the University of Maryland Medical , according to a county statement .
