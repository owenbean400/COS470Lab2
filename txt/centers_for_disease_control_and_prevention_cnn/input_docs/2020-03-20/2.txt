Four family members , a mother and three siblings , have all died after being diagnosed with coronavirus . 
Vincent Fusco , Jr . , a man in his 50s , died today , according to Roseann Paradiso Fodera , a cousin of one of the family members who died and an attorney representing the family . 
" This is an unbearable tragedy for the family , " Paradiso Fodera said . 
Her first cousin , Grace Fusco , was one of the four who passed away after being diagnosed as positive , she said . 
Two of Grace 's children , Carmine Fusco and Rita Fusco Jackson , siblings to Vincent Jr . , also died prior to Grace 's death , Paradiso Fodera said . 
The New York Times was the first to report about the family . 
Paradiso Fodera said the 19 were tested on Saturday , but they have yet to learn the results . 
All family members were hospitalized at Centra State Medical Center in Freehold , New Jersey , except for Carmine , who was at a different facility in Pennsylvania when he died . 
Many family members who are not hospitalized are quarantined together . 
" Why do not the family members who are not hospitalized have the test results ? 
This is a public health crisis . 
Why should athletes and celebrities without symptoms be given priority over a family that has been decimated by this virus ? 
" There must be an investigation by the CDC or NIH as to why this family was so susceptible to the virus , " Paradiso Fodera asked . 
CNN â€™s Bonnie Druker contributed to this report .
