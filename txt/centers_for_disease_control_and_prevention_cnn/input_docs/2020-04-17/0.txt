US President Donald Trump said certain states that are not battling a coronavirus outbreak could open for business as soon as Friday if they meet the criteria laid out by the White House today . 
" If you look at Montana , Wyoming , North Dakota -- that ’s a lot different than New York , it ’s a lot different than New Jersey , " Trump said at the coronavirus task force briefing . 
The President said the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) social distancing guidelines should remain in place unless a governor determines it has gone 14 days with a low enough number of cases to satisfy the new reopening guidelines . 
" They ’ll be in place , dependent on what the governor wants to do , " he said . 
Trump said states could open tomorrow if they retroactively determine they ’ve hit the two week mark , allowing them to move onto the next " phase " of the new guidelines . 
Trump noted that if a governor acted too quickly to open its businesses and allow mass gatherings , the administration would be " expressing ourselves very strongly . " 
" We have large sections of the country right now that can start thinking about opening , " he said . 
The President noted that he asked officials today in meetings why the recommendations included that people wear masks in public , even in an area that has not seen many Covid 19 cases , when things return to a version of normal . 
He said he was told that is to protect locals " if someone should come in from an area that is not so successful " in mitigating the spread of the virus . 
Trump said 29 states are " in that ballgame " of being able to consider reopening in the days ahead .
