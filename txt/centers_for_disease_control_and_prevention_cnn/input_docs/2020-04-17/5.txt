Dr . Tom Frieden , former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said sheltering in place is " just a strategic retreat " but we are " not fighting the virus . " 
Speaking on Friday during a Vital Strategies webinar , Frieden said we are currently " trapped in our home , wrapped in our fears , isolated in our hospitals . " 
In order to reopen America , Frieden said we need to " box it in , " utilizing a four cornered approach of testing , isolating , quarantining and finding the virus .
