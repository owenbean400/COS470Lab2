Certain jurisdictions in the US are " very close " to having testing capabilities in place in order to reopen , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said during an appearance on NBC Friday morning . 
This does not mean the American public can " let up " on the mitigation strategies that include frequent handwashing and physical distancing , Redfield said . 
" This new opening up — which has that requirement of early case diagnosis and isolation and contact tracings — is really embedded , as you 'll see in the phases , with still maintaining that personal vigilance , that personal mitigation so that we can continue to limit and protect the vulnerable in this nation , " Redfield said . 
Redfield added : " So it 's important not to let up at all , but do this in a prudent , gradual way as we go through the different phases and really maintain those mitigation strategies of handwashing , social distancing , wearing a face covering when you 're in public if you 're in an area where there 's still significant ongoing transmission like we still see in New York , Boston , obviously Baltimore , Washington , different parts of our nation .
