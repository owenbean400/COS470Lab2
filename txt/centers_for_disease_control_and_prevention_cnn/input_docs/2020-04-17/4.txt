Experts have estimated that a coronavirus vaccine could take 12 to 18 months before it is available for the public â€” and without a vaccine , people will still have to maintain some physical distancing measures to keep the virus from spreading , Dr . Tom Frieden , former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said on MSNBC this morning . 
" We do not know when a vaccine will come , " Frieden told MSNBC Friday . 
Due to this , Frieden said the United States could be facing a " new normal . " 
" What we 're going to need to see is a gradual loosening of the faucet . 
A step wise return to not normal , but a new normal , where no one who is sick goes out , where we stop shaking hands for a while , where we cover our mouth and for a while wear face masks , " Frieden said . 
Frieden said that while individuals can do a lot to reduce the risk of transmission , people who are vulnerable " are going to have to shelter in place for longer . 
Maybe not that long , but longer . " 
On a public health level , Frieden emphasized that people need to get tested when they 're at risk and isolate when they 're infected . 
It is also important to track contacts to determine who may have been exposed and quarantine them , Frieden said . 
" This is the way we can try to keep the virus at a simmer instead of boiling over , " Frieden said .
