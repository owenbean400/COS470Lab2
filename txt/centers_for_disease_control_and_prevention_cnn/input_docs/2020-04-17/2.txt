South Korea 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) reported Friday that 2.1 % of recovered coronavirus patients have retested positive . 
Out of 7,829 patients who recovered from Covid 19 and were released from isolation , 163 retested positive . 
It is currently unclear why patients could be retesting positive and the phenomena is being reviewed by the government . 
Most experts think it 's unlikely that somebody will be reinfected right after recovering . 
It 's possible that issues with testing – or varying amounts of viral RNA in the body , which the tests look for – could explain why people tested positive after testing negative . 
KCDC reports that the positive tests came back between 24 hours and 35 days , but the average was around 13.5 days following release from isolation . 
Out of 137 cases the KCDC observed , 43.9 % showed mild symptoms . 
Samples were taken from 28 of the cases that retested positive and so far six samples did not cultivate the virus . 
Examination of the 22 other samples is ongoing .
