The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet returned to shipping coronavirus test kits to state labs after some tests were initially found to be faulty , Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said Friday during a call with reporters . 
The CDC wants to make sure that " every T is crossed before we put these kits back out , so we ’re taking a little extra time here , " Messonnier said . 
She declined to give a specific timeline . 
Why this matters : Earlier this week , the agency said some state labs had been unable to validate the test . 
The CDC is now remanufacturing a reagent used in the test that was yielding " indeterminate answers , " Messonnier said . 
" What we ’re doing at CDC is reformulating those reagents , " she said , " and we are moving quickly to get those back out to our labs " with state and local partners . 
Before it began shipping these kits , the CDC was the only lab in the United States that could test for the virus . 
Experts say the new test kits open the door to confirming cases earlier , thus being able to take swift action to contain any further spread in the United States . 
The CDC had previously announced plans to ship roughly 200 test kits to domestic labs and another 200 to international labs . 
Each test kit can perform 700 to 800 patient samples .
