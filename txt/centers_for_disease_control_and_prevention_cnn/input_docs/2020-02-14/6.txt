The United States has to be guarded in making any assessment , pro or con , about the numbers and facts coming out of China about the novel coronavirus , US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNN . 
Azar reiterated the need to send experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to China , but did not know when that would happen . 
The CDC first offered to send its experts to China on Jan . 6 . 
Azar defended the administration 's policy that bans foreign nationals who have visited China in the past 14 days from entering the country , saying the Unite States has " limited public health resources " and needs to prioritize citizens who are returning from China . 
" Once they have been out of China for that 14 day incubation period they are welcome , as always , into the United States , " Azar said .
