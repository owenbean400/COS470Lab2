President Trump on Friday repeated the theory that the novel coronavirus will die out as temperatures rise in the spring , but scientists insist it ’s just too soon to say for sure . 
Infectious disease experts studying the virus say it may have a seasonal variation , or it may not . 
Several tell CNN it ’s too early to tell , and nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior . 
CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield told CNN in an interview , which aired Thursday , that the coronavirus may or may not be around past this year and it may or may not follow a seasonal variation — insisting only time will tell . 
" We do not know a lot about this virus , " he said . 
" This virus is probably with us beyond this season , beyond this year , and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community based transmission . " 
Trump also estimated that there were " around 12 " confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US . 
As of Friday , 15 individuals tested by the CDC tested positive for the coronavirus .
