The US Surgeon General on Sunday pushed back on the idea that face coverings infringe on freedoms – and said they ’re important to slow the spread of coronavirus and reopen the economy . 
He said face coverings lead to less asymptomatic spread of the virus , which leads to more places opening sooner . 
" Exercise and promote your freedom by choosing to wear a face covering ! " 
Adams said in the tweet , which also included a photo of him in a mask . 
What this is about : Public health officials have emphasized the importance of face coverings amid the country ’s reopening , given that people without symptoms could unknowingly transmit Covid 19 . 
The coverings are primarily to prevent people with the virus from infecting others . 
Earlier guidance from US officials did not recommend widespread masking , but in April , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face coverings for the general public in places where social distancing is difficult to maintain , like grocery stores . 
At the time , CDC cited growing evidence that people could spread coronavirus without feeling sick .
