Detroit hospitals are being stretched thin as coronavirus cases skyrocket in the Michigan city . 
First responders at the city 's fire department are still assisting residents -- and when the call comes in as code " Charlie , " that signifies it 's a possible Covid 19 call , a Detroit Fire emergency medical technician ( EMT ) tells CNN . 
First responders try to educate and inform those with mild symptoms of the CDC guidelines , the EMT says . 
Ultimately , they have to transport people if they ask to be brought to the hospital . 
While responding to a call , the EMT says first responders from the fire department are in constant communication with " medical control , " an ER physician on the other radio . 
While in the home , even with their personal protective equipment ( PPE ) on , they 're trying to maintain a six foot ( 1.8 meters ) distance with any patients . 
Right now , the EMT says they believe they have a good supply of PPE . 
They are constantly cleaning their trucks , too .
