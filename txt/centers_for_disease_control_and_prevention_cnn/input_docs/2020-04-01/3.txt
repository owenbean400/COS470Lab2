The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to re examine possible changes to its recommendations on the general public wearing face masks . 
In the meantime , US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said that there are three things you should do if you decide to wear a mask . 
He broke it down on the " Today " show on Wednesday : Do not touch your face : " If you ’re going to wear a face covering , please try not to touch your face . 
Please be very , very careful about making sure you do not touch your face , " Adams told NBC ’s Savannah Guthrie . 
Do not use an N95 : " If you ’re going to wear a face covering , please save the N95 masks for healthcare workers who need them , " Adams said . 
Stay at home : " Wearing a face covering does not mean that you do not have to practice social distancing . 
The most important thing you can do is stay at home right now , and we do not want people to feel like ‘ OK I ’m covering my face so now it ’s OK for me to go out in public , ' " he said .
