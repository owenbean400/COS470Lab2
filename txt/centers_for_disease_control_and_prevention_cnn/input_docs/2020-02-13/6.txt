Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals . 
In rare cases , they are what scientists call zoonotic , meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Here 's what else we know about the viruses : The symptoms : The viruses can make people sick , usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness , similar to a common cold . 
Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose , cough , sore throat , possibly a headache and maybe a fever , which can last for a couple of days . 
For those with a weakened immune system , the elderly and the very young , there 's a chance the virus could cause a lower , and much more serious , respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis . 
How it spreads : When it comes to human to human transmission of the viruses , often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person 's secretions , such as droplets in a cough . 
Depending on how virulent the virus is , a cough , sneeze or handshake could cause exposure . 
The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes . 
Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient 's waste , according to the CDC .
