The novel coronavirus may impact the world for some time to come , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield told CNN ’s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta in an interview today . 
While more research is needed to fully understand the virus , Redfield said that the CDC has focused on surveillance to track cases and containment to slow down the possible progression of the virus in the United States . 
" I do think that eventually we are going to be in more of a mitigation phase in dealing with this virus but that ’s not to underestimate the importance of the containment phase that we ’re in right now , " Redfield said . 
" The containment phase is really to give us more time . 
This virus will become a community virus at some point in time , this year or next year , " Redfield said . 
" We do not have any evidence that this coronavirus is really embedded in the community at this time , but with that said , we want to intensify our surveillance so that we ’re basing those conclusions based on data . "
