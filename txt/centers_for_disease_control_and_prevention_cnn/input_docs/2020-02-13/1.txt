The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday that it ’s remaking parts of coronavirus test kits because some produced inconclusive test results . 
The CDC had sent kits to states to speed up testing . 
For quality control , the states then had to verify that the kits worked before testing patients -- but some kits returned inconclusive results during this verification process . 
Some states said the results they were getting were not false negatives or false positives , but were inconclusive , said the CDC . 
So it 's remaking the one reagent in the test that is not performing consistently . 
Which labs are affected : State labs that have been successful in verifying the test kit works can go forward with the testing . 
Those that have not been successful will have to wait for the CDC to ship out the replacement components . 
The CDC did not confirm how many states were affected or when they might receive the replacement components . 
" We have multiple levels of quality control to detect issues just like this one . 
We ’re looking into all of these issues to understand what went wrong , and to prevent these same things from happening in the future . "
