Nearly six weeks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first offered to help China with its coronavirus outbreak , the offer still has not been accepted , CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield told CNN . 
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus was first identified in early January . 
He added : " That letter has not been responded to yet by the official Chinese government . 
We do believe that we ’re the best in the world in this space and we ’re ready to help and assist them , but they ’re an independent nation that has to make that decision that they ’re going to invite us in . "
