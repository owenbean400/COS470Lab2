Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , is expected to testify this morning that the agency " has developed a new laboratory test that checks for three viruses at the same time , two types of influenza viruses ( A and B ) and SARS Co V 2 , the virus that causes Covid 19 . " 
What this means : In his opening statement , prepared for the House Energy and Commerce Committee and posted online , Redfield said , " testing for all three viruses simultaneously will allow public health laboratories to continue surveillance for influenza while testing for Covid 19 . 
This will save public health laboratories both time and resources , including testing materials that are in short supply . " 
Redfield said the single test for all three viruses will also help find co infections , " which is important for doctors to diagnose and treat people properly . "
