Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , says getting a flu vaccine this year will be more important than ever . 
" Getting a flu vaccine is more important now that [ sic ] ever . 
Getting a flu vaccine will help keep you and your loved ones out of a doctor â€™s offices and hospitals and help conserve scarce medical resources to care for Covid 19 patients , " he said . 
Redfield said the CDC is working with public health officials across the United States to increase the number of people who get the flu vaccine . 
" Ongoing Covid 19 activity may affect where and how flu vaccines are given . 
CDC is working with manufacturers to maximize flu vaccine supply and with providers and health departments to develop contingency plans so that people can be vaccinated in a safe environment , " Redfield says .
