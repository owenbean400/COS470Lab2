The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s mandatory 14 day quarantine for nearly 200 Americans who returned from Wuhan , China , is the first such order in more than 50 years . 195 Americans , many of them diplomats and their families , flew from Wuhan to California on Wednesday . 
They ’ve been staying at March Air Reserve Base since then . 
The last time the US imposed this kind of quarantine order was in the 1960s for smallpox evaluation , said Martin Cetron , director of the CDC ’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine . 
He said most of the passengers were " exuberant and elated to be out of harm ’s way " during their journey from Wuhan , and they understand the need for a longer quarantine . 
US cases : There are now seven confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US : three in California , one in Washington , one in Arizona , and two in Illinois .
