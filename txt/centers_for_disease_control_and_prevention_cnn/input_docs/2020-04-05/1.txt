Dr . Scott Gottlieb , the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , is calling for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to publish more data on coronavirus patients in the United States . 
That information is needed to help doctors navigate the new virus , said Gottlieb in a series of tweets Sunday . 
He served as FDA commissioner from 2017 to 2019 . 
Gottlieb cited anecdotes on how many patients die after being put on ventilators â€“ and suggested that more reliable information is needed . 
" Doctors are being forced to let clinical experience guide care decisions in absence of systematic data , " Gottlieb tweeted . 
He added that such publications " wo not matter much in May . They 're needed tomorrow . 
Today . 
Urgently . " 
While the CDC has published some information on coronavirus patients to help guide health care workers , much of it is based on data from China . 
The agency has also released limited data on hospitalization and underlying conditions among patients in the US .
