The incidence of Covid 19 among adolescents appears to be much higher than what 's seen among younger children , according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The report , published on Monday , found the average weekly incidence of Covid 19 among adolescents ages 12 to 17 between May and September was about 37 cases per 100,000 childrenâ€”nearly double the 19 cases per 100,000 children ages 5 to 11 . 
" Although mortality and hospitalization in school aged children was low , Hispanic ethnicity , Black race , and underlying conditions were more commonly reported among children who were hospitalized or admitted to an ICU , providing additional evidence that some children might be at increased risk for severe illness associated with COVID 19 , " the report said . 
More on this report : The report included data on 277,285 laboratory confirmed Covid 19 cases among school aged children in the United States from March 1 to Sept . 19 . 
Among those cases , 37 % were in children ages 5 to 11 and 63 % were in adolescents . 
The report also noted that the weekly incidence and percentage of positive Covid 19 tests among the school aged patients appeared to vary over time and by region . 
Overall , 58 % of the patients reported at least one Covid 19 symptom , 5 % reported no symptoms and information was missing or unknown for the rest of the cases . 
The data also showed that 1.2 % were hospitalized , including 404 patients who required ICU admission and 51 patients who died of Covid 19 . 
At least one underlying health condition was reported for 3 % of all the cases , such as asthma , diabetes , psychological conditions , cardiovascular disease and severe obesity , according to the report . 
The data might underestimate the true incidence of disease among school aged children , as testing was often prioritized for people with symptoms and those without symptoms may not have been tested as often , the researchers noted . 
Yet overall , the CDC researchers wrote , " These findings can provide a baseline for monitoring national trends . "
