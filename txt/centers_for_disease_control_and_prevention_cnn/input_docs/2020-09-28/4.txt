NBC News reported Monday that US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield was overheard during a phone call in public on a commercial airline saying , " Everything he says is false . " 
NBC News , which heard the comment , said Redfield acknowledged after the flight from Atlanta to Washington , DC , that he was speaking about Dr . Scott Atlas , a neuroradiologist who joined the White House Coronavirus Task Force in August . 
NBC said that Redfield , in the conversation with a colleague on Friday , suggested Atlas is providing President Trump with misleading data about the efficacy of masks , young people ’s susceptibility to the coronavirus and herd immunity . 
In a statement to CNN , a CDC spokesman did not deny the conversation took place : A federal health official tells CNN , more broadly , " bottomline , the story is accurate . " 
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment . 
CNN has reported that Atlas – a critic of severe lockdowns who was supported herd immunity strategies against the coronavirus – has found himself at odds with other medical experts in his administration , including Dr . Anthony Fauci and Dr . Deborah Birx . 
On Friday , Fauci said during an interview that the Trump administration has pivoted away from receiving daily guidance from the White House Coronavirus Task Force to focus more heavily on the economy . 
" We 're meeting now on an average of one and at the most two times a week , " Fauci said .
