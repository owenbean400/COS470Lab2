The city of San Antonio filed a lawsuit Monday against the federal government , including several agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services , to prevent further releases of individuals who have been quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base without the city ’s input and demands . 
The move follows the CDC ’s release of a woman from quarantine at Lackland AFB , who later tested positive for the coronavirus . 
As part of its efforts to protect its community from the outbreak , the city is also demanding that patients undergo three tests for coronavirus , instead of the current two , as part of the protocol to end their quarantine . 
The lawsuit is also seeking a protocol that would be agreed between the city , the state of Texas and the CDC prior to releasing patients who are under quarantine . 
City officials are also asking the court to maintain the status quo of the surgeon general ’s exercise of quarantine authority . 
The surgeon general , with the approval of the health and human services secretary , is legally authorized to make and enforce a quarantine if he deems it necessary to prevent the introduction , transmission or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States .
