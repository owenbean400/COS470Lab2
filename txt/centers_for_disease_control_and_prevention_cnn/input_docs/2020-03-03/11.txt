US officials are pressing airlines to collect and share more data on international travelers while federal health officials combat the coronavirus , two officials tell CNN . 
The data request includes contact information that would help health officials follow up with potential carriers of the coronavirus , or fellow travelers who may have come into contact with an infected person . 
The request itself is outlined in an interim final rule the CDC and Department of Health and Human Services issued in mid February . 
It requests airlines provide , within 24 hours of a CDC request , each passenger â€™s name , " address while in the United States , " email address , and both a primary and secondary phone number . 
The only issue is that many air carriers do not currently collect some of the contact details the CDC is requesting , according to an industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity . 
Bookings made through a third party search engine , for example , may include highly limited information about a passenger .
