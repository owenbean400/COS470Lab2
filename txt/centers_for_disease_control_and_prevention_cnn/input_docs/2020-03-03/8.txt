The United States is on the brink of a larger coronavirus outbreak that may reflect uncontained spread in other countries , according to a top official with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
While containment efforts focus on identifying and isolating cases of the novel coronavirus , Messonnier warned that mitigation efforts – those that seek to reduce the virus ’ impact on communities once it ’s already spreading – may be coming . 
" As more areas see community spread , local communities may start employing tools that encourage social distancing , " she said . 
" The goal of social distancing is to limit exposure by reducing face to face contact and preventing spread among people in community settings . "
