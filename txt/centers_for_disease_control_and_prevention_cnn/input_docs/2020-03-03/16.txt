US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said the United States should have the capacity to perform about a million novel coronavirus tests by the end of the week . 
During the Senate Health hearing on response to coronavirus , Hahn was pushed to explain how he thinks the US could do a million tests when to date , it has only been able to perform about 3,600 tests . 
Hahn expanded saying , " I want to distinguish between the ability to get the test kits out to the laboratories with the ability with the labs to actually do the test . " 
Hahn said the FDA has been working very closely with all manufactures to build on this platform that CDC has developed . 
The company it is using has " estimated they are going to be able to scale up to deliver 2,500 kits by the end of the week to providers of the test . "
