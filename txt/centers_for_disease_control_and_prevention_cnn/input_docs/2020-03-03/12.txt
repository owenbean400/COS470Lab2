San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg declared a local public health emergency Monday following the CDC release of a woman from quarantine at Lackland Air Force Base who later tested positive for the coronavirus . 
" It 's worth reiterating that this declaration is explicitly designed to ensure evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship cohort remain at Lackland AFB until further testing is completed , " Nirenberg tweeted . 
Lackland Air Force Base is in San Antonio .
