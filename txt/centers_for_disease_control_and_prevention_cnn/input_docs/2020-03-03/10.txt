The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say it ’s developing a system to track the number of people in the United States tested for the novel coronavirus and it hopes to post that information online — but that does not satisfy a US congressman who wrote a letter of complaint to the agency this week . 
The CDC ’s plan is " wholly inadequate , " according to Rep . 
Mark Pocan , a Wisconsin Democrat . 
How the CDC got here : For weeks , the CDC has been posting the total number of people it has tested for the virus on its website . 
On Monday , that information disappeared . 
The CDC website still posts the number confirmed and presumptive positive coronavirus cases . 
Until last week , CDC was one of only a few labs in the United States testing for the novel coronavirus . 
Now , many public health labs across the United States are able to perform the test . 
Pocan sent a letter to CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield expressing concern about the vanished data . 
On Tuesday , a CDC spokeswoman sent an email to CNN about its new plan . 
" We ’re working on a system to get [ novel coronavirus ] test results from state and local public health labs each week and hope to post that , " CDC ’s Kristen Nordlund wrote to CNN . 
Pocan told CNN that this that plan was " more of an excuse than an answer . " 
He added that the CDC keeps track of national health data for a wide range of diseases and should be able to keep track of testing data for the novel coronavirus on a daily basis . 
" There ’s only 50 states . 
We can get this information relatively easily , " he said . 
At a briefing on Tuesday , Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said that since " many states are now testing and reporting their own results " any numbers CDC reports " would not be representative of the testing being done nationally .
