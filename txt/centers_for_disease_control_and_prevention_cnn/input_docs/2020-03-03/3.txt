A US congressman has sent a letter of concern to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after it stopped listing on its website the number of Americans tested for the coronavirus . 
Since January , the CDC had been publishing a cumulative total of US novel coronavirus cases and the number of patients who have been tested in the United States . 
The change on Monday was met with skepticism from Rep . 
Mark Pocan , a Wisconsin Democrat . 
According to Pocan 's letter , on Sunday the CDC 's website listed how many cases were travel rated , the number of person to person cases , the total number of people tested , and the number of coronavirus deaths . 
But on Monday , the website no longer listed the number of people in the United States who had been tested . 
In an email early Tuesday morning , the CDC told CNN : " Now that states are testing and reporting their own results , CDC â€™s numbers may not represent all of the testing being done nationwide . "
