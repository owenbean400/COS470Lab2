127 people have completed their 14 day quarantine at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today in a statement . 
This group included 125 individuals from the Diamond Princess cruise ship as well as two additional individuals , the statement clarified . 
15 other people who were repatriated from the cruise ship remain " locally in medical care or quarantine because of their close contact with a confirmed case , " the statement said . 
This decision comes after the city of San Antonio filed a lawsuit Monday against the federal government to obtain a temporary restraining order over the government ’s actions to release individuals from quarantine and the government ’s " failure to consult with and incorporate local government in the planning and implementation process , and risks imposing a serious burden on the City 's emergency services . " 
A judge denied the motion for a temporary restraining order the same day , court records show . 
Today , however , the city praised the CDC for making changes to release plans . 
Several buses will transport those being released from Lackland Air Force Base directly to the airport , where people will take flights or rental cars to travel home , the city ’s statement said .
