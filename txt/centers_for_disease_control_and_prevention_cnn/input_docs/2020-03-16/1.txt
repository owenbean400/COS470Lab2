The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published interim guidance Sunday recommending " that for the next 8 weeks , organizers ( whether groups or individuals ) cancel or postpone in person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States . " 
The CDC 's recommendation does not apply to " day to day operations of organizations such as schools , institutes of higher learning or businesses . " 
" This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus . 
This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials , " the CDC said .
