The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced its first employee diagnosed with novel coronavirus , according to a statement . 
The agency , which is leading the national public health response to the pandemic , said the employee who tested positive is in " good condition and is isolated to prevent spread of infection to others . " 
The infection was confirmed by CDC 's own lab testing . 
The agency specified that the employee was not involved in its response to the outbreak , nor have they been on the premises since March 6 â€” at which time they did not have any symptoms . 
Other employees in the same unit are working remotely while their office undergoes deep cleaning , the statement added . 
The CDC said it is not sharing further details about this case , or other potential cases down the line , due to privacy concerns . 
On March 9 , Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC 's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , told reporters the agency that no one of the " more than 1,500 people who have worked on this response so far " had tested positive for the virus .
