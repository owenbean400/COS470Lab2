The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Austria has passed 10,000 , the country â€™s health ministry has said . 
A total of 10,769 people have tested positive for Covid 19 in the country , and the death toll now stands at 146 . 
Wearing face masks to become compulsory : Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced earlier this week that wearing face masks in shops would become compulsory . 
The health ministry says this measure will take effect from April 6 . 
Shops and drugstores in Austria will be required to provide customers with a mask if they are not already wearing their own . 
The order puts Austria , along with the Czech Republic and Slovakia , at odds with some international medical authorities . 
WHO and US CDC experts have long argued that people who are not sick nor caring for someone who is sick should leave masks in the medical supply chain for health care workers who need them most . 
But some experts who have made the argument for people to wear masks have pointed to past research showing the effectiveness of masks against the spread of influenza and to early research on Covid 19 .
