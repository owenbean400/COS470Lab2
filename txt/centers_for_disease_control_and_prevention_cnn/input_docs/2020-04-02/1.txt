A prestigious scientific panel told the White House last night that research shows coronavirus can be spread not just by sneezes or coughs , but also just by talking , or possibly even just breathing . 
He said his letter was sent in response to a query from Kelvin Droegemeier with the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House . 
" This letter responds to your question concerning the possibility that [ coronavirus ] could be spread by conversation , in addition to sneeze/cough induced droplets , " the letter states . 
" Currently available research supports the possibility that [ coronavirus ] could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients ' exhalation , " it continues . 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the virus spreads from person to person when people are within about six feet of each other . 
It spreads " through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes . " 
Fineberg told CNN this is true â€” but that research shows that aerosolized droplets produced by talking or possibly even by just breathing can also spread the virus . 
Fineberg said it 's possible that aerosolized coronavirus droplets can hang in the air and potentially infect someone who walks by later . 
How long coronavirus lingers in the air depends on several factors , including how much virus an infected individual puts out when breathing or talking , and also on the amount of circulation in the air , he said . 
He added , however , that coronavirus is not as infectious as measles or tuberculosis .
