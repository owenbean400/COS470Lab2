The United States is lagging behind several other countries in its Covid 19 vaccination efforts , according to an analysis by CNN of the most recent government data . 
In the US : 2,127,143 doses were administered from December 14 through December 28 at 9 a.m . 
That ’s 151,939 shots per day , or a daily rate of 46 shots per 100,000 people in the country . 
That is significantly lower than the daily vaccination rates for Israel , the UK , and Bahrain . 
The daily rate per 100,000 in Israel is 608 , for Bahrain it ’s 263 , and for the UK it ’s 60 , according to data supplied by those governments . 
The US is vaccinating quicker than Canada , where the daily rate is 10 doses per 100,000 people , according to researchers at the University of Toronto . 
So far , 11,445,175 doses of the vaccine have been distributed to US states , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
US Assistant Secretary of Health Admiral Brett Giroir said the 2 million number for doses administered is likely an " underestimate " because reporting of shots " is delayed three to seven days , so we certainly expect that to be a multiple of two million . " 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , however , said that even if the 2.1 million is an underestimate , it ’s still lower than what had been hoped for . 
" Even if you undercount , two million as an undercount , how much undercount could it be , " Fauci said . 
" So , we are below where we want to be . "
