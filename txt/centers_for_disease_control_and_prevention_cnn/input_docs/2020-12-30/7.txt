The US needs to be doing a better job with its Covid 19 vaccine rollout , Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir said Wednesday . 
" Of course , we need to be doing a better job , but all vaccine programs start somewhat slow , " Giroir told CNN ’s Jake Tapper . 
He said he expects distribution to ramp up soon and that the US is on track to distribute 20 million vaccine doses by the first week of January . 
As pharmacies begin to play a larger role in vaccine administration , Giroir said he expects the pace to quicken . 
" We have a federal contract with 40,000 pharmacies – that ’s 60 % of all pharmacies in the US – to provide vaccines , " said Giroir . 
" The scale will go up very rapidly as things progress and evolve . " 
" Vaccines on the shelf are no good , " he added . 
" They need to get in people 's arms and we are leaving no stone unturned to do that . " 
Some background : Operation Warp Speed is on track to fall well short of the 20 million vaccine shots they predicted would be administered by the end of December . 
Nearly 2.6 million vaccine doses have been administered in the United States , according to data given to CNN by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
