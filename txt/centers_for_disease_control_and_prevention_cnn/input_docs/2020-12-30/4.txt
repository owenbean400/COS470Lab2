Dr . Ashish Jha , the dean of Brown University 's School of Public Health , said he ’s " super frustrated " about the slower than promised pace of US coronavirus vaccinations . 
The Trump administration " decided that their job essentially ends when the vaccine gets to the state and there 's nothing more to do , " Jha told CNN . 
Federal officials previously said that 20 million people would be vaccinated by the end of December . 
So far , more than 2 million doses have been administered , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Jha said vaccination centers should ’ve been set up in states . 
Jha questioned why planning for vaccinations was not ironed out months ago . " It strikes me as a level of incompetence I have to say I am stunned by , " Jha sad . 
" We did this with testing , we did this with PPE , but I thought we were going to get it better with vaccines . "
