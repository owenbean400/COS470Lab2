The federal government hopes to start vaccinating people against coronavirus within a day or two of Food and Drug Administration emergency authorization , officials said Friday . 
" We fully anticipate that both Pfizer and Moderna will have data of both safety and effectiveness of their vaccines very shortly . 
We are very encouraged because their clinical trials are going extraordinarily well , " Paul Mango , deputy chief of staff for policy at the Health and Human Services Department , told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
Mango was announcing a plan for retail pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens to distribute any eventual coronavirus vaccine to long term care facilities such as nursing homes under an agreement – not a contract – with the federal government ’s Operation Warp Speed . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Dr . Jay Butler noted that a third of coronavirus deaths in the US have been among residents of long term care facilities . 
" We believe that this plan will be the quickest and easiest way to provide vaccines to long term care facility residents , " Butler told reporters . 
The CDC asked states to submit plans for vaccine distribution Friday . 
Workers and residents of long term care facilities are expected to be among the first to get vaccinated .
