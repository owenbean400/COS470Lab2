The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline change Monday about aerosolized transmission of coronavirus was not the result of political pressure , according to a federal official familiar with the situation . 
The official said the guideline change was published without first being thoroughly reviewed by CDC experts . 
" Somebody hit the button and should not have , " the official said . 
The official added that the guidance is " getting revised , " but did not say when the revision would be posted to the CDC ’s website . 
What the guidance says : The guidance pertains to the way the novel coronavirus is spread . 
While it ’s known it can spread by droplets directly between people standing less than 6 feet apart , there ’s been some debate about whether the virus can suspend in aerosolized particles in the air and transmit to people further than 6 feet away . 
The agency tried to further clarity what it meant by aerosol transmission , the official said . 
" It can occur , but it ’s not the way the virus is primarily being transmitted , " the official said . 
But in the effort to say that , it was written in such a way " that it ’s being understood to mean it ’s more transmissible than we thought , which is not the case . " 
The source said the guidance that was posted by mistake on Friday was not noticed over the weekend , and CDC became aware of it Monday through reporters ’ calls .
