Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have the ultimate determination for recommendations on who gets a Covid 19 vaccine first , and that he would have no hesitation in taking it if he was in that group . 
" The CDC has the ultimate determination for the recommendations , " he told CBS ’s Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation on Sunday . 
" They do that closely with an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , which is also being complemented by recommendations from the Nation Academy of Medicine , but at the end of the day it ’s the CDC . " 
Fauci explained that the CDC will make recommendations after an emergency use authorization is implemented as they will know what was discussed with the FDA . 
" They ’ll be able to say okay , on the basis of our determination and our advisory committee , this is the prioritization of people who will get it , " he said , adding that that if things go well , " and I think that they will , " and the vaccines get the EUA which is expected , " we will have maybe 20 million people will be able to get vaccinated by the middle to the end of December and then as we get into January , February , even more . " 
" Would you take it next month ? " 
Brennan asked him .
