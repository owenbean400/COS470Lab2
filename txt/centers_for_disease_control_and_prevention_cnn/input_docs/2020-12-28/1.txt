Admiral Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said on Good Morning America that when it comes to the number of Covid vaccines that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported being administered , " the two million number is probably an underestimate . " 
On Saturday , the CDC Covid Data Tracker said that 9,547,925 vaccine doses had been distributed and 1,944,585 had been administered . 
Giroir said that 10.8 million doses have been distributed to the states , " that two million number is delayed three to seven days , so we certainly expect that to be a multiple of two million . " 
Giroir said that another four point seven million doses would be distributed this week , so by the end of the week there would be over 15 and a half million doses " in the hands of the states . " 
There will be another allocation Tuesday , he said , saying " that â€™s the rhythm , " with states being told what they will get the following week .
