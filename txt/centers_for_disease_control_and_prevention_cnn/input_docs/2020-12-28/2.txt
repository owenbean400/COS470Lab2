The Transportation Security Administration said it screened a record number of people at US airports nationwide on Sunday , breaking a pandemic air travel record set only last Wednesday . 
At least 1,284,599 people passed through security checkpoints Sunday , the TSA said . 
That is the highest level air travel has reached since March 15th . 
The new figure is about one half of the number of fliers from the same day a year ago . 
That is a sign that some people are staying home , but not as many as health experts and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would like . 
Earlier this month , the CDC urged Americans to stay home to avoid spreading coronavirus . 
Air travel has spiked , according to the TSA , with US air travel numbers hitting more than a million passengers for six of the past ten days .
