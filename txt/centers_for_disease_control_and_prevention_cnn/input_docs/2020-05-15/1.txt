One of the world 's most prestigious medical journals , the Lancet , tacitly called for new presidential leadership in the United States in an editorial published on Thursday . 
They strongly condemned actions by the Trump administration that they say " chipped away " at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's capacity to combat Covid 19 . 
" The ( CDC ) , the flagship agency for the nation 's public health , has seen its role minimised and become an ineffective and nominal adviser in the response to contain the spread of the virus , " the authors said . 
They criticized the Trump administration for leaving " an intelligence vacuum " in China by cutting back CDC staff in the country just as Covid 19 began to emerge , and pointed to an instance where a prominent CDC doctor was sidelined from news briefings after warning the US to prepare for major disruptions due to the virus . 
They also accused the Trump administration of " punishing the agency by marginalising and hobbling it " after it failed to produce high quality diagnostic tests early in the outbreak . 
" This requires an effective national public health agency , " the authors said .
