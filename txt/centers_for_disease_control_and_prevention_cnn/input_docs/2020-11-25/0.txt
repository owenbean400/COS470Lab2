Some areas of the United States will soon see their health care systems overwhelmed , as coronavirus hospitalizations surge around the nation , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Tuesday . 
" In some areas , we are going to see the health care system overwhelmed , " Redfield said in an interview with Fox News . 
But he said Americans are not defenseless against the virus , and can blunt the surge by practicing mitigation measures . 
He said definitively that safety precautions , such as wearing masks , work . 
" Hope â€™s on the way with a vaccine , " Redfield said , adding that until then , " We still need to really be vigilant about these mitigation steps , and stop the debate about whether they work or not . "
