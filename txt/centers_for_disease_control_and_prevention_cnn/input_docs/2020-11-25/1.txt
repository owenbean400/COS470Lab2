Some face masks can be used even if their manufacturer ’s expiration date has passed , the US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday . 
The FDA posted extensive new guidance about face masks , surgical masks , and respirators on its website Tuesday , with advice about when to use each kind . 
Hospitals , clinics , and other health care facilities have reported shortages and problems managing protective personal equipment , including face masks . 
But certain types should not be re used , the FDA said . 
" The CDC does not recommend the reuse of disposable surgical masks that are intended to be used once . 
The FDA recognizes that there may be availability concerns with surgical masks during the COVID 19 public health emergency , but there are strategies to conserve surgical masks , " it said . 
Respirators , such as N 95 masks , are to be used once and should not be washed , but some can be decontaminated and reused . 
" The FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations ( EUAs ) for devices that decontaminate certain respirators , " it said . 
Mask protection : While the FDA referred frequently to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , its new website does not reference the CDC ’s latest guidance that suggests face masks protect the wearers as well as those around them .
