Thanksgiving week air travel is expected to remain strong enough to set a pandemic era record , despite urging from federal health officials to spend the holiday at home , according to Transportation Security Administration spokesperson Andy Post . 
The agency receives passenger information from the airlines as part of its screening responsibilities , and the data do not show widespread cancelations in recent days , Post said . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week that Americans do not travel for Thanksgiving to prevent coronavirus spread . 
Approximately 4.8 million people have boarded airplanes since that warning . 
More than 900,000 passed through security at America ’s airports on Tuesday , the TSA said . 
Officials still expect Sunday – when everyone heads home from their holiday travels – to be the busiest day travel since the pandemic began .
