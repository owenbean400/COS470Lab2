Instead , notify your local health department and the CDC . 
Keep practicing preventive basics . 
Things like washing your hands and covering coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue can go a long way . 
Hand sanitizer with at least 60 % alcohol can be used as a substitute . 
People should also clean frequently touched surfaces . 
You may want to avoid poorly ventilated buildings , even if it 's your own building -- it can raise the risk of infection .
