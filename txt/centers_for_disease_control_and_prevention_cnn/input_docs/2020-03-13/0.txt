Alaska has identified its first coronavirus case , a " foreign national " traveler , according to Gov . 
Mike Dunleavy . 
The case is a presumptive positive case -- meaning the patient has tested positive in public health labs but is still pending final confirmation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 
The patient is a foreign national who was " transiting through " the state , according to State Chief Medical Officer Dr . Anne Zink . 
" My heart goes out to this individual , as they are suddenly here and getting this news and information far away from loved ones and family , " Zink said today . 
Alaskan officials are not identifying the patient â€™s country of origin , but say the individual came to the state by plane and has been cooperative . 
Zink says they consider this " an isolated case , " although they are prepared to see more coronavirus cases in the future . 
Officials say they currently know of no one else in danger from exposure to the patient .
