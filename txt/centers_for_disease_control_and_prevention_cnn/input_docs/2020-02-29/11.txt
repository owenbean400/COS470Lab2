The US Food and Drug Administration announced on Saturday a policy allowing certain US labs to test for the novel coronavirus using diagnostics the labs developed and validated , even before the agency has reviewed them . 
The policy will enable more rapid testing capacity , the agency says . 
" We believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public health emergency , " FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said in a statement . 
" We will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow up with the critical independent review from the FDA , while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the US . " 
The guidance goes into effect immediately : Once labs have validated a test , they must notify the FDA and should submit a request for an emergency use authorization within 15 business days . 
This policy applies only to labs certified to perform high complexity testing . 
Local and state labs â€™ ability to test for the novel coronavirus was delayed because test kits previously developed by the US Centers for Disease Control were flawed . 
The CDC said Friday that US labs were able to start testing for coronavirus using revised instructions for kits previously sent out . 
CDC also has manufactured brand new test kits that are available for order . 
The CDC said its goal was for every state and local health department testing for coronavirus by the end of next week .
