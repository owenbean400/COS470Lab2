The number of novel coronavirus cases is changing quickly . 
A real time tracking map shows us just how quickly . 
The map from Johns Hopkins University 's Center for Systems Science and Engineering follows coronavirus cases across the world . 
The dashboard collects data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the World Health Organization , the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Chinese website DXY , which aggregates data from China 's National Health Commission and the CCDC . 
The results populate a worldwide view of coronavirus cases in real time .

The map tracks deaths , too , in total and by city .
