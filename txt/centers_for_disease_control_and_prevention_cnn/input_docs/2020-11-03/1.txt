Soaring coronavirus case counts around the United States are impacting children at " unprecedented levels , " according to new numbers released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and the Children 's Hospital Association , which are tracking data reported by state health departments . 
There were 61,000 new cases in children during the last week of October , " which is larger than any previous week in the pandemic , " the AAP said in a statement . 
From the onset of the pandemic through October 29 , more than 853,000 children in the US have tested positive for Covid 19 , the AAP said , including nearly 200,000 new cases during the month of October . 
Yet these numbers are likely an undercount , the AAP said . 
Because symptoms in children are often mild and can look like common colds or viruses , many children go untested . 
Typical symptoms of Covid 19 in both children and adults include a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher , a dry cough , difficulty breathing , headaches , digestive issues , body aches and fatigue , runny nose , sore throat and sneezing . 
However , early research has suggested children may not get fever , cough or shortness of breath as often as adults . 
Fever and cough were found in 56 % and 54 % of children in one study , compared to 71 % and 80 % of adults , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Shortness of breath was found in only 13 % of pediatric patients , compared to 43 % of adults . 
Sore throat , headache , muscle pain , fatigue and diarrhea were also less commonly reported in children .
