Vaccine experts are warning the US federal government against rushing out a coronavirus vaccine before testing has shown it 's both safe and effective . 
Decades of history show why they 're right . 
The Cutter incident : On April 12 , 1955 the government announced the first vaccine to protect kids against polio . 
Within days , labs had made thousands of lots of the vaccine . 
Batches made by one company , Cutter Labs , accidentally contained live polio virus and it caused an outbreak . 
More than 200,000 children got the polio vaccine , but within days the government had to abandon the program . 
Some 40,000 children got polio , several hundred were left with paralysis , and about 10 died , said Dr . Howard Markel , a pediatrician and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan . 
The epidemic that never was : In 1976 , scientists predicted a pandemic of a new strain of influenza called swine flu , and advisers urged President Gerald Ford to hastily prepare a vaccine . 
The government launched the program in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu , according to the CDC . 
That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain Barre syndrome , which can develop after an infection or , rarely , after vaccination with a live vaccine . 
Rushing a vaccine could lose the public 's trust : People 's mistrust of the system makes the idea that the FDA would rush this process before late stage clinical trials are complete " colossally stupid , " said Markel . 
" All it takes is one bad side effect to basically botch a vaccine program that we desperately need against this virus . 
It 's a prescription for disaster . "
