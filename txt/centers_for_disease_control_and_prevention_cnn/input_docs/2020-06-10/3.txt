World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday addressed the confusing comments that a WHO official made earlier this week about the asymptomatic spread of novel coronavirus . 
" But here is what we do know — that finding , isolating and testing people with symptoms , and tracing and quarantining their contacts , is the most critical way to stop transmission , " Tedros said . 
" This is a new virus and we 're all learning all the time . 
Communicating complex science in real time about a new virus is not always easy , but we believe it ’s part of our duty to the world . 
And we can always do better . 
We welcome constructive debate . 
That 's how science advances . " 
On Monday , Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO 's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit , said during a media briefing that " it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual . " 
Then on Tuesday , WHO held a live question and answer session on its social media pages where Van Kerkhove clarified her comments , saying that the asymptomatic spread of Covid 19 is possible , but more research is needed to determine how often it occurs . 
The comments appeared to directly contradict guidance from public health organizations , including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which have said about a third of coronavirus infections may be asymptomatic . 
The CDC also estimates that 40 % of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick , meaning they are pre symptomatic .
