Schools must reopen , but they have to do so safely , former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr . Tom Frieden said Wednesday . 
" Education is essential . 
Interruptions in education because of coronavirus have cost millions of students precious little time and have slowed or stalled educational progress , " Frieden , who is now CEO of the advocacy and public health consultancy group Resolve to Save Lives , said during a livestream event to outline the organization â€™s blueprint for how to reopen schools safely . 
However , he warned , " we ca not just charge forward . " 
" That 's not going to work , because of what happened in Arizona , Texas , Florida and elsewhere : one step forward too fast , many steps backward , and for a long time . 
Trying to open schools without accounting for and protecting students and staff from Covid is going to backfire , " said Frieden .
