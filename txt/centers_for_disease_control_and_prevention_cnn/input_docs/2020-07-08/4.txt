It could be impossible to operate schools safely in communities where coronavirus infections are out of control , Dr . Tom Frieden , former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said today . 
Frieden is now CEO of Resolve to Save Lives , an advocacy and public health consultancy group that has put together a plan for how to reopen schools safely . 
" The hard truth is that there is no route to zero risk of Covid 19 in the near future , but we can reduce the risk with careful planning and precautions , " Frieden said while speaking at a livestream event today . 
" But here ’s the bottom line : The single most important thing we can do to keep our schools safe has nothing to do with what happens in schools -- it 's how well we can control Covid in the community . " 
He said that right now , because there are places around the country where the virus is spreading explosively , " it would be difficult — if not impossible — to operate schools safely there until the virus is under better control in those communities . " 
When the time comes to reopen schools , Resolve to Save Lives introduced an eight point plan " designed to complement evidence based guidelines , such as that from the CDC , and to help education leaders make important decisions for each state and school district , " Frieden said . 
The eight points are : " We do not live in an ideal world , and we do not have all the information we wish we had about how to protect our children 's health and future . 
We need to use the best available information to continue to learn so we can figure out how to improve the safety of our children at schools , the robustness of our society and of our economy , " Frieden said . 
He said reopening schools is something we must do to more fully open our society and our economy . 
" We can succeed if we take careful steps forward and respond rapidly to new information or cases . 
Our children 's future depends on it , " he said .
