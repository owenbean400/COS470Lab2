An advisory committee to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to meet next week to decide who will get a Covid 19 vaccine first , according to a longtime member of the committee . 
Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices received notice last week that they â€™ll meet Nov . 23 for five hours , according to committee member Dr . William Schaffner . 
A spokesperson for the CDC confirmed the meeting . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci told CNN Sunday that he expects the first vaccinations to occur " towards the latter part of December . " 
But there wo not be enough vaccine for everyone to get it at once , so the CDC will set priorities . 
Among the first to get the vaccine will be health care workers , and essential workers , and in addition , those over age 65 and people with underlying conditions because they are at high risk for complications from Covid 19 . 
The question is what order these groups should be in , Schaffner said . 
After that , the committee members will need to define what underlying conditions would merit getting a vaccine early on , and what defines " essential workers . " 
That group could include everyone from police officers to supermarket clerks . 
" There have been huge ethical discussions about this , " Schaffner said . 
The CDC committee was expected to make a decision about prioritization months ago , but did not .
