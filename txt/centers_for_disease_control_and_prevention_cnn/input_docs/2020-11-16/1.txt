The Moderna coronavirus vaccine seems to protect some of the people most at risk of severe coronavirus disease â€“ the elderly and people of color , Noubar Afeyan , the co founder and chairman of Moderna , said Monday . 
Afeyan said the company does not see " any difference in the results , " among subgroups in its Covid 19 vaccine trials . 
" Moderna actually slightly slowed down the trial recruitment to ensure that we had a substantial representation , and it turns out , 37 % of our trials were people , were subjects , that are considered of color , " Afeyan said on CNN International Monday . 
On Friday , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that hospitalization rates are significantly higher among the Black , Latino and Alaska Native or Native American populations in the US compared to Asian and White people . 
Hospitalization rates are about four times higher among Blacks and Latinos than Whites . 
Afeyan said the company also deliberately recruited older people to be a part of the trial . 
Older people are more vulnerable to getting severely ill from coronavirus infections and vaccines do not always work as well among seniors . 
But interim results showed people who were over 65 and older had a " robust and equivalent " response from the vaccine , Afeyan said .
