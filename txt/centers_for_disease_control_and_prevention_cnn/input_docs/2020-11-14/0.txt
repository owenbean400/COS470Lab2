Any eventual coronavirus vaccine will be distributed across US states and territories based on population , a top Operation Warp Speed official said Friday . 
" Vaccines will be allocated pro rata by population , " General Gustave Perna said at a news conference led by US President Donald Trump in the White House Rose Garden . 
Pfizer is expected to apply for emergency use authorization ( EUA ) from the US Food and Drug Administration before the end of the month . 
State health officials have said they have not heard many details from the federal government about how the vaccine distribution will be organized , and they have not received the funding they need to get infrastructure in place . 
" We are working closely , along with the CDC , the 64 jurisdictions and states , to ensure the vaccine can safely and quickly get to those who need it first . 
And then we have plans to ensure that it spreads exponentially across our country and that no place is left without a vaccine . " 
No one at the news conference addressed January 's transition could affect distribution . 
Pfizer and Moderna will likely seek EUA from the US Food and Drug Administration for their vaccines within the next few weeks and vaccinations could begin in December , Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , said at the briefing . 
Pfizer says its vaccine is more than 90 % effective , based on early data . 
Moderna announced this week it had enough coronavirus cases among trial participants to complete its first interim analysis , and Slaoui said that " probably next week we may hear what I hope to be another very good information regarding an efficacious vaccine . " 
Slaoui added that if other vaccines are approved , the number of vaccinations per month could increase .
