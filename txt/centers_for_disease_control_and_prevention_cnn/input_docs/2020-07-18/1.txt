What we know : At least 39 states as well as Washington , DC and Puerto Rico have implemented some type of face mask requirement . 
But in Georgia — which is among the 18 states in the coronavirus " red zone " that should roll back reopening measures , according to an unpublished document prepared for the White House — the governor has clashed with mayors on such restrictions . 
Georgia Gov . 
Brian Kemp sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms on Thursday over her efforts to require face masks in public places . 
Several other mayors say they are prohibited from enacting the mask requirements supported by their residents because of on order from Kemp . 
And in Utah , a public meeting about a mask policy was abruptly canceled when people without face coverings packed the room . 
The crowd booed when it was called off . 
" This is the exact opposite of what we need to be doing , " Utah County Commissioner Tanner Ainge said at the meeting room in Provo . 
" We 're supposed to be physically distancing , wearing masks . 
This gathering violates current health recommendations . "
