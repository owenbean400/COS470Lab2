The nation â€™s top infectious disease doctor says a study published Thursday night shows people can spread the Wuhan coronavirus before symptoms set in . 
In the study , which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine , German researchers described four business associates who became infected through asymptomatic transmission . 
" They were in workshops together , they went to the company canteen together , " Dr . Camilla Rothe , an infectious disease specialist in Germany who co authored the paper , told CNN . 
A woman from Shanghai met with German business associates at a company near Munich on January 20 . 
The Chinese woman was healthy during her visit to Germany . 
Within eight days , four employees of that company were diagnosed with Wuhan coronavirus . 
None of them became seriously ill , but Fauci said there was concern that they would pass along the infection to someone who could develop life threatening complications . 
Chinese health authorities said earlier this week the Wuhan coronavirus could be spread while people were asymptomatic , but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had not seen evidence of that .
