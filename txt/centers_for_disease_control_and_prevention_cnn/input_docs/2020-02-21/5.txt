The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now track confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States in two separate and distinct groups : those repatriated by the US Department of State and those identified by the US public health network . 
What this means : By these new metrics , there are now 21 confirmed cases among repatriated Americans and 13 confirmed cases among Americans first identified on US soil , said Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC â€™s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease . 
Eighteen cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship now back in the United States . 
Three cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Wuhan repatriation flights now back in the United States . 
Up until yesterday , the CDC was reporting 15 confirmed cases in the United States . 
The reason that number has dropped to 13 is because two cases have moved into the case count of repatriated individuals . 
The change in the counting system starts today .
