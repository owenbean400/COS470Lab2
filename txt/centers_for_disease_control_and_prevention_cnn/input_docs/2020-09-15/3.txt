The Covid 19 pandemic has worsened mental health issues , especially for young people of color , a mental health expert said Monday . 
Isha Weerasinghe , who leads mental health work for the Center for Law and Social Policy , said that poor support for mental health in many communities has been made worse during the pandemic . 
She cited a lack of connectedness due to isolation , economic hardships , increased stress due to police brutality and its impacts , and anti Asian violence and bullying . 
She added that the lack of access to health care in many communities extends to a lack of mental health care . 
" There have been , of course , through the pandemic relaxed regulations in terms of telehealth , but when we 're talking about people living in low income communities and households ... they are privileges that only some of us are able to access , " Weerasinghe said . 
Many of these communities were burdened with higher levels of mental health issues before the pandemic began . 
She cited data from recent years showing disproportionately high rates of suicide , self harm , anxiety and depression among young people of color , whose communities have now been hit harder by the Covid 19 pandemic . 
" We â€™ve seen an egregious increase in suicide rates for Native young people , said Weerasinghe , citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Fatal Injury and Violence data from 2016 to 2018 . 
" We 've seen an increase in suicide rates in Black and Hispanic young men , and we 've seen an increase in rates of non fatal self harm for all young people , with an increase particularly among Black young people . " 
The CDC recently released a report showing more people were thinking about suicide this June .
