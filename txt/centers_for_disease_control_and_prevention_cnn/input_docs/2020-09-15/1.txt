Officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) are not " disloyal to the administration . 
They are loyal to science , " former CDC Director Dr . Tom Frieden said Tuesday . 
" I know the doctors and scientists at CDC well , " Frieden said at a briefing hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America . 
" They are devoted to stopping disease wherever and whenever it occurs . " 
Frieden , who is now President and CEO of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives , said the CDC is not loyal to any political party .
