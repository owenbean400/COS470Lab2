Philanthropist Bill Gates said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that the US Food and Drug Administration has lost credibility during the coronavirus pandemic . 
" We saw with the completely bungled plasma statements that when you start pressuring people to say optimistic things , they go completely off the rails . 
The FDA lost a lot of credibility there , " Gates told Bloomberg 's Erik Schatzker . 
" Historically , just like the CDC was viewed as the best in the world , the FDA had that same reputation as a top notch regulator , " Gates said . 
" But there ’s been some cracks with some of the things they ’ve said at the commissioner level . " 
In a Stat interview published Monday , Gates criticized FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn ’s mischaracterization of data about convalescent plasma as a Covid 19 treatment . 
Hahn has previously acknowledged his misstatement and said criticism of his remarks was " entirely justified . " 
On Bloomberg Television , Gates also spoke about his frustration with the lack of US funding for vaccinations in the developing world .
