" Proving that a vaccine works is easier than proving that it ’s safe , " former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Tom Frieden said Tuesday . 
During an event hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America , Frieden said he has two safety concerns regarding a potential Covid 19 vaccine . 
" First are the Kawasaki like syndrome and illnesses that we 've seen in children , and possibly similar illnesses in adults , " Frieden said . 
" That is an immune reaction , and therefore there 's a theoretical chance that some vaccines could create that kind of reaction . " 
Frieden , who is currently president and CEO of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives , emphasized that he is not predicting this will happen , but suggesting that we do due diligence in watching out for it . 
" The second concern is sometimes called antibody dependent enhancement , " Frieden said . 
" This has been seen in some old vaccines , half a century ago , but it also was seen in an animal model of one SARS vaccine . " 
" The risk there would be some people – after vaccination , if they then became infected with Covid – could get sicker then they would have otherwise , " he explained . 
Frieden said that we likely will not know everything we need to about vaccines until they are given to thousands , or maybe even millions of people . 
" But we need to track safety at every step of the way and be completely open with the public about it , " he said .
