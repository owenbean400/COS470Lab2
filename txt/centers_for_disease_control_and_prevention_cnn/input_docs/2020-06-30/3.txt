Any new coronavirus vaccine will have to work at least 50 % better than a placebo in preventing infection or serious disease in people , the US Food and Drug Administration said in new guidance released Tuesday to vaccine makers . 
New vaccines should also be at least as safe as other vaccines against infectious diseases , and testing should include three to four weeks ’ follow up in volunteers to make sure there are no adverse events , the FDA said . 
While that ’s not considered desirable for a vaccine , it ’s within the range of current influenza vaccines , for instance . 
In some years flu vaccines can have 40 % efficacy or even less in preventing infection . 
That compares to measles vaccines , which have about 97 % efficacy after two doses , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The FDA also says that vaccine makers should specifically ask about adverse events in volunteers for at least seven days after they get the vaccine , and then wait for any unsolicited reports of side effects for 21 to 28 days after each vaccination . 
And any study should include watching for serious events requiring a medical intervention for at least six months after the last vaccination . 
" All pregnancies in study participants for which the date of conception is prior to vaccination or within 30 days after vaccination should be followed for pregnancy outcomes , including pregnancy loss , stillbirth , and congenital anomalies , " the FDA adds in its guidance . 
But it does not say pregnant women should be excluded . 
And companies making vaccines using new and untested designs will have to test in animals first , the FDA said . 
The guidelines also consider reports that show Blacks and Hispanics are especially hard hit by the virus . 
" FDA strongly encourages the enrollment of populations most affected by COVID 19 , specifically racial and ethnic minorities , " the guidelines say .
