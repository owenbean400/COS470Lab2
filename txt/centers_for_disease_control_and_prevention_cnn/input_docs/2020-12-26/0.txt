Passengers arriving in the United States from the United Kingdom must test negative for Covid 19 before departure , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday . 
Passengers will be required to have a negative PCR or antigen test within 72 hours of boarding their flight from the UK to the US . 
Passengers are also required to provide documentation of their laboratory results , either as a hard copy or electronic .

The agency said the order will be signed Friday and go into effect on Monday .
