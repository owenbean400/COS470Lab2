Nearly 2 million coronavirus vaccine doses have been administered in the United States , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The CDC Covid Data Tracker says that as of 9 a.m . Saturday , 9,547,925 vaccine doses have been distributed and 1,944,585 doses have been administered . 
Totals of distributed doses and administered doses now include both Pfizer/Bio NTech and Moderna Covid 19 vaccines . 
In an update on Wednesday , the CDC said at least 9,465,725 vaccine doses have been distributed and at least 1,008,025 doses of the vaccine have been administered . 
Federal officials have said the number of people who have received their first vaccine dose is likely higher , and there are a number of reasons why doses distributed appears to be outpacing doses administered . 
There are lags in data reporting , and while doses are considered distributed as soon as they leave a facility , administration does not happen all at once . 
Many hospitals are just setting up their vaccine processes , and are staggering vaccinations among staff and the federal effort to vaccinate people in long term care facilities is only just getting underway .
