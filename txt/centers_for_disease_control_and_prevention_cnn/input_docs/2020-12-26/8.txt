The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday posted new guidance for people with certain underlying medical conditions who are at increased risk for more severe Covid 19 . 
Here are some key points from the guidance : The guidance addresses people with weakened immune systems , people with autoimmune conditions and those who have previously had Guillain Barre syndrome and Bell ’s palsy . 
All of these groups " may receive an m RNA Covid 19 vaccine " according to the recommendations , provided they have not had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine . 
People with HIV and those with weakened immune systems due to other illnesses or medication should be aware of " limited safety data " on the use of Covid 19 vaccinations in those populations , and that they may experience a weakened immune response to a vaccine . 
The guidance says there have been no reports of Guillain Barre following Covid 19 vaccination . 
And while cases of Bell ’s palsy have been reported after m RNA Covid 19 vaccination , " the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population , " the CDC said . 
" They have not concluded these cases were caused by vaccination . " 
The CDC also says that people who get vaccinated should continue to practice Covid 19 prevention measures until it is known whether the vaccine prevents the spread of the virus .
