New testing requirements for travelers entering the US from the United Kingdom have not been implemented quickly enough to be effective against a reported Covid 19 variant in the UK , said Dr . Richina Bicette , medical director with the Baylor College of Medicine , on Saturday . 
" The CDC requirements do not take place until Monday , " she said . 
" Until that time , there have been thousands , if not hundreds of thousands of people that have traveled into the U.S . from the U.K . 
So there â€™s a high probability that the new variant is already in the United States and we just do not know . " 
Remember : The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday that passengers arriving in the United States from the United Kingdom must test negative for Covid 19 before departure , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday . 
Passengers will be required to have a negative PCR or antigen test within 72 hours of boarding their flight from the UK to the US . 
Passengers are also required to provide documentation of their laboratory results , either as a hard copy or electronic . 
Airlines are required to confirm the test results before the flight , and passengers will not be permitted to board if they refuse a test or do not provide documentation . 
The order is in response to a new coronavirus variant that is said to have originated in the UK and is potentially more transmissible . 
Since the discovery of the variant , more than 40 countries have restricted travel from the UK , and in some cases , also travel from other countries that have documented cases with the variant .
