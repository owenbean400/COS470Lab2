Four people in Madrid have been diagnosed with the Covid 19 variant detected in the UK earlier in the month , the health advisor for the region , Antonio Zapatero , said during a press conference on Saturday . 
According to Zapatero , one of the infected people arrived from the UK and was diagnosed on Thursday . 
The three others are members of their family , who went to the hospital after exhibiting symptoms . 
The UK variant has an unusually large number of mutations -- 14 changes and 3 deletions in its genetic code that impact the building blocks of its proteins , according to the US CDC . 
Scientists advising the UK government have made a preliminary estimate that this variant could be up to 70 % more effective at spreading than others .
