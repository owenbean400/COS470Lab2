Getting to herd immunity – when so many people are immune to a virus that it stops circulating – is a great thing , but the cost of getting there can be very high , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday . 
" Herd immunity is something that 's always discussed — but one of the things you 've got to be careful of is as follows : When children get infected , even though statistically they have a much , much lower chance of getting a severe outcome and requiring hospitalization … the only thing is that there still is a risk , " Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said at a briefing with Connecticut Gov . 
Ned Lamont . 
" Children can get seriously ill . 
It ’s a rare event , but it is not zero — particularly the thing that we 're learning about the … hype inflammatory syndrome some children get . 
So we should never take it lightly , going for herd immunity by getting the children infected , " he said . 
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS C has affected several hundred children in the US and while treatable , can put kids into the intensive care unit for days or weeks . 
And at least six children have died , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Fauci said that while in the big picture a community wants to reach herd immunity , it should not be at the expense of the children , or at those who would be put at risk if a child infected them . 
Herd immunity can be achieved in two ways – after most of a population has been infected and either died or recovered , or through mass vaccination .
