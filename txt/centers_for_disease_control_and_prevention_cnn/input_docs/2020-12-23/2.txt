Dr . Rochelle Walensky told CNN ’s John Berman Wednesday there have already been " numerous meetings " around a new coronavirus variant identified in the UK . 
If Walensky , the incoming director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , were advising the President today , she said the conversation would involve limiting mobility . 
The real question now , she said , if there is concern about a specific strain , is what is the best way to control it so that it does not explode in other places ? 
One way " might be to ban travel , " Walensky said , but there are other strategies as well , including quarantines upon arrival , testing around arrival or some combination . 
I think it ’s really important to understand which of those strategies or combinations of those strategies is going to limit the spread , " she said . 
" It ’s not clear yet that banning travel is going to be the one , especially since we ’ve been saying limit your mobility already . "
