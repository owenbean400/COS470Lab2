Scientists from the UK â€™s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group ( NERVTAG ) say they are now " highly confident " the new variant of coronavirus is more infectious than others , with a " hint " that it could be more transmissible in children . 
According to NERVTAG , the new variant -- which is believed to have originated in southeast England -- could be around 71 % more transmissible than other variants . 
" As of last Friday , we felt we had moderate confidence because the data was coming in , but some of the analysis had been done very quickly , " Peter Horby , professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University Oxford and chair of NERVTAG , said during a virtual news briefing on Monday . 
Speaking alongside Horby , Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London noted that there is a " hint " that this variant " has a higher propensity to infect children , " compared with earlier strains . 
But he cautioned that " we have not established any sort of causality on that , but we can see that in the data , " he added . 
Another NERVTAG member , Wendy Barclay , head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London , said earlier strains of the virus may have had a " harder time " getting into human cells using a receptor called ACE2 . 
Adults , who have a lot of this receptor in their noses and throats , are " easy targets " compared to children . 
But under this hypothesis , a virus that can more readily use this receptor to enter cells may make children just as susceptible to the virus as adults , she said . 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , some research suggests the UK strain may " bind more tightly " to the ACE2 receptor , but " it is unknown whether that tighter binding , if true , translates into any significant epidemiological or clinical differences . "
