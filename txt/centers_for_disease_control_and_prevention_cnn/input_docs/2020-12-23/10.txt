Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis plans to issue an executive order to ensure seniors , over the age of 65 , are the first members of the general public to receive the Covid 19 vaccine . 
The announcement was made Wednesday during a press conference in Pensacola . 
De Santis said his order will guarantee seniors will be in the front of line to get vaccinated , despite the CDC recommending essential workers have priority as well . 
So far , about 70,000 shots have been administered to frontline health care workers and seniors in long term care facilities in Florida , De Santis said . 
According to De Santis , Florida has received 367,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine , which have been delivered to over 170 hospitals . 
County health departments are beginning to receive small amounts of the vaccine as well and will begin administering the shots to seniors as early as Monday , De Santis said .
