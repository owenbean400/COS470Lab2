Dr . Anthony Fauci told CNN he is undertaking a " modified quarantine " after it was determined that he was not in close proximity to a White House staffer who tested positive for the novel coronavirus . 
The nation 's top infectious disease expert said he is at " low risk " and tested negative for the virus on Friday . 
Fauci says he will stay at home and telework -- though he might go to his office at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , where he would be the only one there -- and wear a mask continually for 14 days . 
He is expected to be tested every day for the virus . 
Fauci is the third member of the White House coronavirus task force going into quarantine . 
Dr . Stephen Hahn , director of the Food and Drug Administration , and Robert Redfield , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , are also going to quarantine for 14 days .
