The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday recommended that airlines continue to follow " routine operating procedures " for cleaning aircraft during the coronavirus outbreak unless an ill passenger is on board – including those with fever , cough or difficulty breathing . 
The recommendations will be updated as more information becomes available , it said . 
If symptomatic passengers are identified during or immediately after a flight , the CDC said airlines should follow enhanced cleaning procedures — including personal protective equipment , such as disposable gloves and gowns , for cleaning staff . 
Airlines should clean any soft surfaces — such as cloth seats and seat belts — within 6 feet of any ill passenger , the CDC said . 
That includes removing " visible contamination if present " and using other cleaners . 
The CDC also said airlines should disinfect hard surfaces within 6 feet of an ill passenger , including seats and seatbacks , tray tables , seat belt latches , light and air controls , crew call buttons , overhead compartment handles , walls , bulkheads , windows , shades and video monitors . 
Airlines should also clean bathrooms used by symptomatic passengers and dispose of any items that cannot be cleaned , such as pillows . 
Additionally , the CDC reminded airlines of their obligation , under US regulations , to report any symptomatic travelers on domestic or international flights to US health officials . 
Travelers who must be reported to the CDC include those with a fever that has lasted for more than 48 hours , or travelers with a fever and other signs of illness , such as a cough or difficulty breathing .
