Coronavirus testing is underway for cruise ship passengers aboard the Grand Princess , passenger Michael Bell told CNN . 
The tests were delivered to the ship via a California Air National Guard helicopter a short time ago .

Col . Jonathan Shiroma told CNN . 
Nearly 100 passengers have been identified as needing to be tested , including guests and staff , Princess said in an earlier statement .
