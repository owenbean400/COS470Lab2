South Africa diagnosed a traveler returning from Italy as its first case of the novel coronavirus on Thursday . 
Mkhize said that the patient went to a general practitioner on March 3 with symptoms of fever , headache , malaise and sore throat and cough ; a nurse took a swab and it was delivered to a lab and the patient went into self isolation . 
The couple also have two children , the statement added . 
Mkhize said that authorities were tracing contacts , the doctor is self isolating , and a tracer team has been sent to Kwa Zulu Natal province . 
At the onset of the outbreak , South Africa was just one of two countries in the continent with reliable testing capabilities . 
That has since expanded to more than 40 , according to the African CDC .
