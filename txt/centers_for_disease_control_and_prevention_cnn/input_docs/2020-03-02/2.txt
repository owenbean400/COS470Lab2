The answer from US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams is simple : No . 
He tweeted this on Saturday : The tweet comes during what has become a mask boom . 
With coronavirus popping up in the United States , some have begun buying face masks as a form of protection , despite the likes of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Vice President Mike Pence saying they 're unnecessary . 
Washing your hands , staying home when sick and other " everyday preventive actions " are the best protections , Adams said . 
He urged people to get a flu shot , as fewer flu patients means more resources to fight the coronavirus .
