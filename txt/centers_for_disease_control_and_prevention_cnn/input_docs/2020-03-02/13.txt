US Sen . 
Patty Murray of Washington , the ranking Democrat on the Senate health committee , said she is pushing to make sure the federal government reimburses state and local governments for costs incurred by testing people who may have the coronavirus . 
They want such language to be included in the emergency spending bill . 
" The biggest thing I hear at home now … is the lack of tests . 
… They are scrambling as fast as they can to urge the CDC to get more tests out . 
… They think they can do 100 a day right now – that ’s not nearly enough , " Murray said .
