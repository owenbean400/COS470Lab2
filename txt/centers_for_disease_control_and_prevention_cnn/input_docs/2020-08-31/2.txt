Covid 19 patients who are obese face more serious disease than those without obesity , a new study finds . 
Nearly all intensive care patients who were studied ended up on a ventilator if they had severe obesity , the researchers founds . 
Obesity is listed as a risk factor for severe disease by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies . 
Dr . François Pattou , head of the Department of General and Endocrine Surgery at Lille University Hospital in France , along with colleagues set out to quantify the risk . 
Back in April , Pattou ’s team began to look at Covid 19 patients across Europe . 
They studied 124 patients admitted to intensive care units and compared them with 306 patients in the intensive care unit for reasons other than coronavirus . 
They found about half of the patients with Covid 19 in ICU had obesity , defined as a body mass index or BMI over 30 . 
A quarter of the patients had a BMI of 35 or above , Pattou found . 
But only around 10 % of the patients had a BMI that was under 25 , considered a healthy weight . 
When researchers compared this to the non Covid patients in ICU , fewer were obese . 
" A quarter had obesity or severe obesity ; a further quarter were overweight , and around half fell into the healthy weight range , " the European and International Congress on Obesity , where the findings will be presented , said in a statement . 
Doctors know obesity puts patients at higher risk of severe illness from infectious respiratory diseases such as flu . 
Pattou ’s study found that the higher a patient ’s BMI , the worse the symptoms . 
" Several months into the Covid 19 pandemic , the increased risk posed by this virus to people living with obesity could not be clearer , " Pattou said in a statement . 
" Our data show that the chances of increasing to more severe disease increases with BMI , to the point where almost all intensive care Covid 19 patients with severe obesity will end up on a ventilator . "
