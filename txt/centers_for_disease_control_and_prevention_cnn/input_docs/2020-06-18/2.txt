Days before hosting a massive rally in Tulsa , Oklahoma , President Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that some people at the rally this Saturday may catch coronavirus , but added " it ’s a very small percentage . " 
The President 's words come as Oklahoma is seeing a steady increase in its average of new confirmed cases per day . 
According to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University data , Oklahoma averaged about 203 new cases per day over the week ending June 17 , which is up approximately 110 % from the previous seven day period . 
As of Thursday morning , Tulsa County currently has the most cases — 1,825 total — of any county in the state , according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health . 
New cases in Tulsa County have also been climbing , and the county is now seeing its highest seven day average for new cases at 73.9 , according to the Tulsa Health Department . 
Trump also claimed , according to the Journal , that some Americans wore face masks as a political statement against him and not as a preventative measure . 
However , guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) makes it clear that Americans should wear a mask . 
Rally attendees will not be required to maintain social distance or wear masks , despite the Trump administration 's top public health officials stressing the importance of both measures in preventing the spread of coronavirus . 
Campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted on Monday that the campaign plans to check the temperature of everyone who enters the venue . 
They will also be providing hand sanitizer , and each attendee will receive a mask provided by the campaign , although they will not be required to wear it . 
Local and campaign officials tell CNN that more than a million people have RSVP 'd to the rally . 
A local official involved in planning said they expected 100,000 to show up at the Bank of Oklahoma Arena on Saturday . 
The venue can hold just under 20,000 .
