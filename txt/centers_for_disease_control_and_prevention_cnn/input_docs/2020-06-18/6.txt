After Kansas State reported two student athletes had tested positive for coronavirus one day before on Tuesday , the school 's athletic director Gene Taylor said in a statement : " We will always keep our focus on the health and well being of our student athletes and staff , a small number of positive tests was something that we were anticipating based on what we are seeing from across college football , and our medical staff and coaching staffs are well prepared for the next steps .

Football players had returned to the school for voluntary workouts on Monday but after the most recent cases , student athletes will not be allowed to work out on campus until July 1 .
