Social distancing is the best defense against spreading coronavirus , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday . 
The virus does not travel well over distances of longer than six or seven feet , Redfield said . 
He added that people can " maintain six feet distancing , if we can wear face coverings when we are in public , particularly when we ca not maintain the distancing … and maintain vigilance in our hand hygiene … these are going to be really , really important defense mechanisms . "
