The US has probably only counted about 10 % of people infected with coronavirus , Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Thursday . 
The CDC has been looking at antibody tests done across the country to see how many people had past infections that were not diagnosed at the time , and sees many more cases than have been officially reported . 
With more than 2 million official diagnoses , that would mean more than 20 million Americans have been infected . 
These numbers are in part because testing was at first limited to people who were very ill and showing up in hospitals or in nursing homes . 
Now , as more people are getting tested , it ’s clear that a large percentage of people did not have any symptoms , or mild symptoms , Redfield said . 
" The estimates that we have right now … is that 's about 10 times more people have antibody , " Redfield said . 
Redfield estimates that between 5 % and 8 % of Americans have been infected with coronavirus but said that will vary from region to region . 
New York , which had an intense epidemic , will have a higher percentage of people with past infections than some states in the West , for instance , he said . 
But that means 90 % or more of Americans have not been infected and are fully susceptible to the virus , he said .
