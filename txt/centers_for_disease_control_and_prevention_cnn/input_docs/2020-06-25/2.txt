The coronavirus pandemic has moved into younger populations across much of the US , a change that could mean less serious illness and lower rates of death , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday . 
Younger people may not be taking the risk of pandemic spread as seriously as they should , CDC ’s Dr . Jay Butler added . 
" We may need to get out the message that young people are not somehow naturally immune to this virus , although they may be at lower risk of severe infection , " he said . 
The risk of serious complications and death rises with age , the CDC says , although there ’s no clear age cutoff for higher or lower risk . 
People with diabetes , kidney disease , moderate to severe asthma , and obesity are also at higher risk . 
In response to a question from CNN , Butler acknowledged that the US has a high proportion of younger people with obesity . 
" We have to recognize reality . 
Our nation is not as healthy as some other nations , particularly if you look at obesity and some other medical conditions , " he said . 
It will be important to get the message out , Butler said . 
" Everyone needs to understand that there is still some risk of severe illness , including among younger people , " he said . 
Butler said the CDC was exploring the use of social media tools such as Tik Tok to reach a younger audience . 
Some background : The major thrust of new coronavirus cases in the United States is in the South and West , where officials say more young people are ignoring social distancing measures and testing positive . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , told Axios that the recent high number of cases in young people is " not surprising . " 
" They get infected first , then they come home , and then they infect the older people . 
The older people get the complications , and then they go to the hospitals , " Fauci said . 
" The death rate always lags several weeks behind the infection rate . "
