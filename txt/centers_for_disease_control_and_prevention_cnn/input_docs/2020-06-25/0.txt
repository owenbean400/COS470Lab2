Now is the time to normalize the use of masks and practice social distancing to get us prepared for a possible second wave of Covid 19 , said Dr . William Schaffner , professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University and a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Schaffner added that all sectors of society should model this behavior : politicians , religious leaders and businesses . 
" You have to make wearing masks a social norm . 
Every business has to have a sign outside their door that says , ' If you wish to patronize us , please come in with a mask . 
If you have not got one , we 'll give you one . ' 
And then everybody who works in the business has to wear it . 
Religious leaders have to preach that to all faiths , all the time . 
We need chambers of commerce coming out ; local political leaders ; all harmonizing with that message to normalize that behavior in our society . 
And on occasion , you may indeed have to mandate it , " Schaffner said .
