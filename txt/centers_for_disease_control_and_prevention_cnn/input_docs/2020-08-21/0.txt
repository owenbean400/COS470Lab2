As many as 60 million Americans could have been infected with coronavirus , Director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr . Robert Redfield told the Journal of the American Medical Association Thursday . 
The CDC released a report in June , published in JAMA , showing an infection rate in the United States of about 10 % . 
Redfield said at the time he believed testing had missed 90 % or more of cases . 
Redfield said Thursday an infection rate of between 10-20 % translates into as many as 60 million people who may have already been infected , but there ’s not really any good data on the numbers yet . 
" We ’re in the process of obviously following up with the report that we did in JAMA that kind of let us understand that maybe for the 2 million cases we diagnosed , we had an estimated 20 million people infected , " Redfield said in the video interview . 
" We 've now expanded that throughout the country , so very large surveillance work in progress , " he said . 
Redfield said he did not want to speculate on the number of Americans who may actually be infected with the virus , but he did offer an estimate . 
" I really want to be data driven but there is enormous geographic variation . 
I can tell you that we have some areas that we 're looking at less than 1 % and we have other areas we 're looking at 20 % , " he said . 
Confirmed cases : As of Thursday night , at least 5,573,501 coronavirus cases have been recorded across the US , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The total includes at least 174,248 deaths .
