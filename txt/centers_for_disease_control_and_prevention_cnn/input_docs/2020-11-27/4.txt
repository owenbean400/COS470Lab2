A committee that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccines has scheduled an emergency meeting for Tuesday . 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices posted the meeting announcement on its website with little explanation . 
While it does not say explicitly that the meeting is to discuss coronavirus vaccine distribution , there ’s no other likely reason for such a meeting to be called . 
A CDC spokesperson later confirmed the meeting was called to discuss coronavirus vaccines but could not provide more details . 
ACIP met on Monday to discuss whether to recommend any coronavirus vaccine that might get emergency use authorization ( EUA ) from the US Food and Drug Administration and to talk about who should be first in line to get one . 
While the FDA approves or authorizes a vaccine , it ’s the CDC , based on ACIP ’s advice , that decides who should get vaccines and when . 
ACIP usually meets regularly three times a year but the approval of a pandemic vaccine is an unusual circumstance . 
The CDC did not immediately answer requests for explanation about the meeting . 
So far , Pfizer is the only company to apply for an EUA from the FDA . 
The submission to the FDA was based on results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of Pfizer 's vaccine , which began in the United States on July 27 and enrolled more than 43,000 volunteers .
