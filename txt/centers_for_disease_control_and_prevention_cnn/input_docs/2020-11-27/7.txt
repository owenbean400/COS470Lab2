In a virtual Thanksgiving address to US troops yesterday , President Trump said that vaccines for Covid 19 would start to be delivered next week . 
Trump continued by saying that " two companies already announced and a third one coming up and a fourth and fifth one coming up soon also . " 
Shots , however , are not likely to being going into arms within the next two weeks . 
The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its outside advisory panel to discuss drugmaker Pfizer 's application for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine for Dec . 10 . 
On Wednesday , Dr . Peter Marks , director of the US Food and Drug Administration â€™s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , said a decision on the EUA would occur within the weeks after . 
" It will be a matter of weeks . 
It could be from days to weeks . 
I I ca not give you an exact date that we 're going to have an emergency use authorization issued because we have to do it right . 
Obviously we 're going to be working to do it as quickly as we possibly can , " Marks said . 
" It 's possible it could be within days but our goal is to make sure it 's certainly within a few weeks . " 
Once a decision on an EUA is granted , a committee of CDC vaccine advisors then must decide who will receive the initial supply of vaccine before vaccinations begin .
