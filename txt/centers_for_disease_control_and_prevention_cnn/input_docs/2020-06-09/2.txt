Tanzanian President John Magufuli claims his country has eradicated coronavirus " by the grace of God , " but urged people to continue taking precautions , in a speech at a church congregation in the capital city of Dodoma on Sunday . 
The president attributed the result to citizens ' prayers and the efforts of local health officials and frontline healthcare workers . 
Last week , the president said hospitals in the country 's largest city , Dar es Salaam , had only four Covid 19 patients remaining . 
Tanzania has not released any data on coronavirus cases since April 29 . 
At the last count , there were 509 reported cases and 21 deaths in Tanzania , according to Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 
How Tanzania tackled the virus : Regional World Health Organization ( WHO ) officials have expressed concern over Tanzania 's lackluster implementation of social distancing and its decision to keep places of worship open . 
In May , the US Embassy in Tanzania issued a health alert warning that the risk of contracting Covid 19 was " extremely high " as hospitals in Dar es Salaam were " overwhelmed . " 
Early on in the pandemic , Magufuli dismissed the seriousness of coronavirus in Tanzania , urging his citizens to " pray coronavirus away , " believing that the " satanic virus ca not live in the body of Jesus Christ . " 
He blamed the growing number of positive cases on faulty test kits that he claimed were registering animals and fruit as positive . 
Tanzania has eased coronavirus restrictions as universities , high schools , and international travel have all reopened . 
Primary and secondary schools remain closed . 
On Sunday , Magufuli celebrated churchgoers for not wearing masks , claiming that was a sign the country had overcome coronavirus and people were no longer afraid .
