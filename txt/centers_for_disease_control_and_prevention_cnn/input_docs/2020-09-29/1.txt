Asked about tension between members of the United States Coronavirus Task Force , Adm . Brett Giroir told CNN ’s Erin Burnett there ’s honest debate about some matters . 
Tensions have built up between the task force ’s newest member , Atlas , a neuroradiologist without a background in infectious disease or public health , and some of the other members since he joined the group in August . 
Atlas espouses many of President Donald Trump ’s unscientific views regarding the coronavirus , including a reluctance to enforce mask use . 
On Monday , Fauci , another task force member , said he sometimes felt that Trump receives misleading information from one of the other task force members who is out of step with everyone else . 
He did not name Atlas but told CNN : " I think you know who the outlier is . " 
And Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Redfield , another task force member , was overheard on a flight saying " Everything he says is false , " also apparently talking about Atlas . 
But apparently the issue of mask use is clear cut . 
" Wearing a mask … is one of the most important public health measures that you can do . 
You need to wear a mask when you ca not physically distance , because it will protect others from getting infected from you . 
And it does provide a degree of protection to yourself , " Giroir said .
