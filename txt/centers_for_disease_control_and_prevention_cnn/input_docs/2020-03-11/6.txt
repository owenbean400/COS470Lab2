During the House Oversight Committee discussion on the novel coronavirus response , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said some deaths from coronavirus have been discovered posthumously . 
Rep . 
Harley Rouda asked CDC director Dr . Robert Redfield if it ’s possible that some flu patients may have been misdiagnosed and actually had coronavirus . 
" The standard practice is the first thing you do is test for influenza , so if they had influenza they would be positive , " Redfield said . 
Rouda then asked Redfield if they are doing posthumous testing . 
Redfield said there has been " a surveillance system of deaths from pneumonia , that the CDC has ; it ’s not in every city , every state , every hospital . " 
Rouda followed up and asked , " So we could have some people in the United States dying for what appears to be influenza when in fact it could be the coronavirus ? " 
The doctor replied that " some cases have actually been diagnosed that way in the United States today . "
