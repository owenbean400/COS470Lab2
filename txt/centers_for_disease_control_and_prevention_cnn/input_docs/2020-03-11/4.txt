Long story short : There 's not enough data yet , considering this coronavirus just emerged in humans a few months ago . 
The vulnerability of " older adults " has been well documented , but researchers " do not have information from published scientific reports about susceptibility of pregnant women " to this coronavirus , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says . 
" Based on limited case reports , adverse infant outcomes ( e.g . , preterm birth ) have been reported among infants born to mothers positive for Covid 19 during pregnancy , " the CDC says . 
" However , it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection , and at this time the risk of adverse infant outcomes is not known . "
