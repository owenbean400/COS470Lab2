More than 9,200 health care workers have been infected with Covid 19 , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in its first such assessment , published on Tuesday . 
The number is likely an underestimate , since most reports of coronavirus cases do not note whether the person worked in health care . 
Among the health care workers who had coronavirus , 90 % were not hospitalized . 
There were 184 admissions to the intensive care unit , and 27 people died . 
Schuchat added that it is important to focus on making sure that health care workers have the personal protective equipment they need , and that they need to remain vigilant .
