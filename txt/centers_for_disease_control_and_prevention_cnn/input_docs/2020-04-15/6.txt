The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working hard to make sure testing , contact tracing and an expanded public health capacity is in place as the country begins talking about opening back up , director Dr . Robert Redfield said this morning on CBS . 
Asked about the study saying Americans may need to social distance until 2022 , Redfield said , " I think the mitigation steps that we â€™ve done are going to be an important component of it . 
I think it 's really , really a moment to take a bow for the American public that really embraced the social distancing recommendations that we put forward . " 
Redfield added : " It really is the American public 's response to social distance and sacrifice , not for themselves but for the benefit of the most vulnerable . 
It 's really a testament . 
I do think we 're going to have some social distancing that 's going to be a critical part of our strategy as we go forward while we await the fruits of the innovation of the different biological countermeasures to include a vaccine . "
