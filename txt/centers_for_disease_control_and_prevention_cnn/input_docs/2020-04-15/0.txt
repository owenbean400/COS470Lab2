The daily number of Covid 19 tests performed by commercial labs has appeared to slightly decline in the past week , according to a CNN analysis of data from the American Clinical Laboratory Association . 
Members of the ACLA include Lab Corp , Mayo Clinic Laboratories and Quest Diagnostics , among other commonly used labs . 
In the past seven days , between April 7 and 14 , there were about 576,000 newly completed tests reported by ACLA member labs . 
In the seven day period before that , between March 31 and April 7 , there were about 673,000 newly completed tests reported by ACLA member labs . 
Those numbers represent an approximate 14 % decrease in the newly completed tests performed by ACLA member labs . 
What does this mean : It remains unclear what could be fueling the recent slowdown of completed commercial lab tests . 
For instance , some labs may have struggled to meet the demand of testing services and now face backlogs . 
Among other possible factors , there could have been a delay in reporting , or the decline could be tied to stronger efforts to prioritize testing certain at risk patients per updated guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
For now , this recent decline in newly completed tests from commercial labs comes at a time when the number of Covid 19 cases and deaths overall continue to rise in the United States . 
On Wednesday , the nation recorded its highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day after several days in which the death toll had fallen or was nearly flat .
