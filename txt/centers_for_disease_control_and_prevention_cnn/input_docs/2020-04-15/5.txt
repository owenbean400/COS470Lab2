Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , says experts " do not have all the answers " when it comes to antibodies . 
In an interview on the " Today " show , Fauci was asked to comment on a report out of South Korea 's CDC that found coronavirus had been reactivated in a number of patients thought to have recovered . 
" We do not know how common that is , " Fauci said . 
" It 's likely an uncommon event and wo not have a public health impact . " 
" The things that we do not know is that -- in general with viruses we deal with all the time -- when you develop an antibody after infection , it almost invariably means you 're protected . 
We do not absolutely know that for sure yet , " Fauci said . 
He added there is also uncertainty about how long antibodies can protect a person . 
" So are you protected for a month or two or three , a half a year or a year ? 
We need to get experience to know that , " Fauci said .
