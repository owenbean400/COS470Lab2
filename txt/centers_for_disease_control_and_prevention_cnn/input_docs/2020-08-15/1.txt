In Covid 19 hotspot counties across the United States , Latino and Black people were hit particularly hard , according to new research published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Researchers analyzed cumulative case totals from February through June . 
Among 79 hotspot counties that also had data on race , more than 96 % had disparities in Covid 19 cases in one or more racial or ethnic minority group . 
Latino populations were the largest group who lived in hotspot counties and had disparities in cases in the population . 
These disparities were found in three quarters of the hotspot counties , where about 3.5 million Hispanic people live . 
Black people were the next largest group , with about 2 million people living in 22 hotspot counties , where there were disparities in cases identified . 
This was followed by more than 60,000 American Indian/Alaska Natives living in three counties , nearly 36,000 Asian people in four counties and about 31,000 Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander persons in 19 hotspot counties , with disparities in cases within the population . 
There are a number of factors that could lead to the increased risk for Covid 19 in these populations , including structural factors , such as economic and housing policies , social factors , such as essential worker employment status requiring in person work , and long standing discrimination and social inequities that can lead to increased risk of disease , such as limited access to health care and underlying medical conditions . 
Disparities were identified as either a difference of 5 % or more between the proportion of cases and the proportion of the population or as a ratio of 1.5 or greater for the proportion of cases to the proportion of the population . 
The research does have some limitations , the authors said , such as the fact more than half of the hotspot counties did not report enough race data and had to be excluded from the analysis .
