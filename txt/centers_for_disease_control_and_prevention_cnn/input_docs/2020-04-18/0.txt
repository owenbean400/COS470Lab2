Dr . Tom Frieden , former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , says the United States is not doing enough coronavirus testing and that it is " absolutely the federal government ’s responsibility . " 
President Donald Trump said at the beginning of the pandemic that " everyone who wants a test can have a test " -- yet several governors have complained they cannot get enough testing equipment and supplies . 
The Trump plan to reopen the country does not contain a national testing strategy , and has pushed the responsibility back to the states . 
Frieden , an infectious disease specialist , says the country ’s rate of less than 150,000 tests a day is not nearly enough . 
Frieden said it wo not be possible to test everyone , but " that does not mean it ’s hopeless . "
