Contamination in manufacturing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's test for coronavirus caused weeks of delays that slowed the US response to the pandemic , multiple health officials told CNN . 
The problem stemmed in part from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols , a Food and Drug Administration spokesperson said on Saturday . 
Some background : In mid February , the CDC was uncertain whether its test was malfunctioning due to a design issue or a manufacturing issue , two FDA officials said . 
That was concerning to the FDA . 
On Feb . 22 , an FDA official traveled to Atlanta and spent the following days visiting CDC labs to try to sort out the testing problem . 
According to an administration official , the FDA determined contamination was most likely occurring during the manufacturing process and that the CDC had appeared to violate its own manufacturing protocols . 
By Feb . 27 the FDA and the CDC worked together to shift the manufacturing of the CDC test kits to IDT , an outside manufacturer , two FDA officials said . 
Those test kits functioned correctly and were shipped to public health labs . 
" The test manufactured by IDT was distributed and has encountered no issues , thus supporting the conclusion that it was a manufacturing issue , " the FDA spokesperson said in the statement . 
The inspector general also announced that it is doing its own investigation of the test creation and expects to complete the review by 2021 . 
The Washington Post was first to report the issue of contamination .
