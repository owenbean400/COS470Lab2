US senators had a classified briefing on coronavirus this morning . 
As they left , Sens . 
Dick Durbin , Richard Blumenthal and Lamar Alexander all said that one aspect of the novel coronavirus that concerns them is its spread across countries around the world . 
A key question , Democrat Whip Durbin said , is " whether or not [ countries ] will be aggressive in quarantine in cases and reduce the spread beyond their borders . 
We still have to wait to see . " 
GOP Sen . 
Bill Cassidy said that at the end of today 's briefing , the officials present actually said " it did not need to be " classified . 
Sen . 
Roy Blunt , a Republican , echoed that and said the senators did not hear anything " top secret . " 
Durbin also said he believes the Trump administration ’s request for about $ 2 billion in additional funds to deal with coronavirus is a " wise allocation " but added that it " may not even be enough " — repeating a warning that other Democrats have also made . 
Durbin then slammed the Trump administration 's budget request that cuts funds for health agencies like CDC and NIH as " completely backwards . " 
He said he hopes the president reconsiders as " we ’ve got to anticipate that more resources will be needed . " 
GOP Sen . 
Mike Braun of Indiana said " panicking about this does not make sense , " when asked if Americans should be panicked about the coronavirus , pointing to the fact there ’s only been 14 cases so far in the US — not including those from the cruise ship .
