The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still working to make test kits for the novel coronavirus available to state and local labs . 
Some test kits initially sent out by CDC were flawed . 
Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC â€™s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said there are currently only 12 state and local labs in the US that can test samples other than the CDC . 
She added that commercial labs will " be coming online soon with their own tests . " 
" This will allow the greatest number of tests to happen closer to where potential cases are , " Messonnier said .
