With only 12 state and local health laboratories able to test for the novel coronavirus , public health labs are asking the US Food and Drug Administration for permission to create their own tests for the virus . 
The association represents the 150 largest public health labs across the country and is asking the FDA for a special exemption to create its own diagnostics . 
" We find ourselves in a situation that requires a quicker local response , " the association wrote . 
While the CDC currently has no backlog or delay in testing , the lab association ’s CEO , Scott Becker , told CNN that its concern is not about the current situation , but for when community spread of the virus increases . 
" We want to encourage and ensure that we have the test closest to the population , " Becker said . 
The CDC announced on Feb . 6 that 200 test kits would be distributed to labs across the United States . 
The kits needed to be verified by the local health laboratories to ensure they were working . 
Less than a week later , Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said some labs that had received the tests were getting inconclusive results , and components of the tests would need to be remade . 
The CDC has been working to resolve the testing kit issue but has yet to provide a timeline about when labs will receive new tests .
