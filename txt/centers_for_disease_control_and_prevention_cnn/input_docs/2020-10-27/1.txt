An outbreak of Covid 19 among men 's and women 's soccer teams at one university in Chicago can be traced back to birthday parties and other social gatherings , according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Although the players had been drilled about using masks and keeping their distance at practice , they appeared to forget everything when they got together with friends , researchers reported on Tuesday . 
The students made minimal use of masks and social distancing at a birthday party , dorm or apartment visit and casual co ed soccer match â€“ and that most likely contributed to transmission of the coronavirus . 
The report includes the results of an investigation into that cluster of Covid 19 cases among the soccer teams , which was reported to the Chicago Department of Public Health in August . 
That month , a member of the men 's soccer team first reported Covid 19 symptoms . 
He said that he had attended the birthday party and soccer match in the preceding 14 days , according to the report . 
In the days following the start of his symptoms , 17 players total tested positive for Covid 19 among 45 across both the men 's and women 's teams . 
In addition to the co ed soccer match , the report includes 18 social gatherings during the investigation period , such as the birthday party and visits to friends ' dormitories or apartments . 
" All 17 students with Covid 19 attended at least one gathering , " wrote the research team from the CDC , the Chicago Department of Public Health and the University of Illinois at Chicago . 
Colleges and universities may need to " consider conducting periodic repeat testing of asymptomatic students " to identify Covid 19 outbreaks .
