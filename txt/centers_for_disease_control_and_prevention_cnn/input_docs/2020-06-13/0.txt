The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released yesterday long awaited updates to its guidelines for social distancing and times and places where that is difficult . 
In general , the CDC says people should protect themselves by practicing everyday preventive actions , like wearing cloth face covers , not touching your face with unwashed hands , washing your hands often , social distancing , disinfecting surfaces and staying home if you are sick . 
But before you go on that family vacation , head out to a cookout or hit the gym , here are some of the things the CDC says should be top of mind in addition to practicing everyday actions . 
Hosting get togethers • The virus that causes Covid 19 likes stuffy , enclosed areas so well ventilated areas are better — open the windows — and outside is best . 
• When guests arrive , show them where they can wash their hands . 
• Arrange tables and chairs so families can sit together but groups are 6 feet apart . 
• If you serve food , have one person do it , but it 's better if people bring their own . 
• Make a list of who attends , just in case someone who came turns out to have been infected and you have to tell people . 
• If possible , have a virtual get together . 
It 's the best way to avoid getting infected Traveling overnight • Ask the hotel what their cleaning/disinfecting policy is for frequently touched surfaces . 
• If doing your own disinfecting , wear disposable gloves , follow product directions and make sure there 's good ventilation . 
• When walking through a hotel , try to take the stairs • Try to use the places where you might end up within 6 feet of other people -- dining areas , fitness centers , game rooms , hot tubs , lounges , pools , salons , saunas and spas -- as little as possible . 
Going to the gym • Wipe down machines and equipment with disinfecting wipes and use hand sanitizer • Know that locker rooms might only be open so people can use the toilets and sinks • Wear a mask during low intensity workouts • Consider doing any vigorous exercise outside • Do not share items like resistance bands or weight belts , as these are not cleaned or disinfected between each use • No high fives or elbow bumps • Limit your number of indoor group fitness classes Read more on the guidelines :
