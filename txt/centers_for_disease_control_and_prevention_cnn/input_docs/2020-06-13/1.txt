Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said a recent increase in coronavirus cases in a number of states is not necessarily a " second spike . " 
" However , when you start to see increases in hospitalization , that 's a surefire situation that you 've got to pay close attention to , " Fauci told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room on Friday . 
Fauci also said there may not be a so called second wave of Covid 19 cases as some health experts are predicting . 
He advised Americans to follow social distancing recommendations and to continue wearing masks in public , among other CDC guidelines . 
Meanwhile former CDC Director Dr . Julie Gerbering , an infectious disease expert who currently is an executive vice president at Merck & Co Inc . , said Friday that the industry 's collaborative efforts and the 130 vaccines in different stages of production points make her cautiously optimistic the pandemic will end with a vaccine . 
There are plenty of roadblocks that can arise between lab testing and putting a product out into the public , she said . 
" So a little scientific humility is also an important component of the communication , " she said . 
The CDC released its latest versions of guidelines for people Friday with a reminder that the virus is still spreading .

They also warn that public transportation and travel can still be risky and people need to think twice before they leave home .
