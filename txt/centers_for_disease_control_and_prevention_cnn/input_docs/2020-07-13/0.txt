As the number of new coronavirus cases continues to rise sharply in the United States , the Trump administration persists in its messaging about children returning to classrooms in the fall . 
A source close to the Coronavirus Task Force told CNN 's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta : " With regard to schools , each community will have to evaluate the status of the outbreak in their particular area . 
" While there are no hard and fast rules , if a particular community has had a five day sustained increase in community spread , they probably should not be opening schools until they pass through the basic gating criteria of a 14 day downward trajectory . 
That guidance has not changed . " 
These comments come after Education Secretary Betsy De Vos on Sunday refused to say whether schools should follow guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on reopening , saying those guidelines are meant to be " flexible . " 
" There is nothing in the data that would suggest that kids being back in school is dangerous to them , " De Vos said , when asked by CNN â€™s Dana Bash if she can assure parents and students that schools will be safe when meeting in full size , in person classes -- doubling down on a similar comment she made last week .
