White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany said on Monday that the President wants to " point out the fact that when we use science , we have to use it in a way that 's not political . " 
This was in response to a question about what Trump meant by retweeting a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that " everyone is lying " about the coronavirus –– including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
She pointed to some health experts who say not to condemn crowds of protesters while still keeping churches closed as an example . 
" We need to use science , lean in to science but not use it , and cherry pick it to fit whatever our particular political persuasion is , " Mc Enany said . 
Mc Enany added that the President has confidence in the CDC .
