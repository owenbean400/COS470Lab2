Jung Eun kyeong , the director of South Korea 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , believes that it is likely the country will see a second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic . 
South Korea 's response to the pandemic has been hailed as one of the world 's best , in large part due to a massive push by health officials to conduct widespread testing . 
At least 10,694 people have contracted the virus in the country , killing 238 , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University . 
Jung also revealed the preliminary results of a study on retesting positive cases . 
In the six tests completed so far , the virus did not separate during the cultivation study . 
" We understand that the contagiousness is either zero or very low , " Jung said .
