Officials in Northern California 's Santa Clara County have confirmed that two people , one who died on February 6 and another on February 17 , had contracted the coronavirus . 
The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner Coroner performed autopsies on two individuals who died in their residences in February and sent samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , according to a statement from the county . 
Results from the CDC came back today , confirming both tissue samples tested positive for the coronavirus , the statement said . 
The individuals were not tested because they died when coronavirus testing was very limited and was only available through the CDC . 
" Testing criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms , " the statement said .
