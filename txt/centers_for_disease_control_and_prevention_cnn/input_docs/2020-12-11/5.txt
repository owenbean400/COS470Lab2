Vaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted Thursday to recommend the agency grant emergency use authorization to Pfizer and Bio NTech 's coronavirus vaccine . 
While the vote is an important step in the vaccine authorization and distribution process , it does not mean the vaccine will be authorized immediately . 
Here 's what happens next : The FDA EUA : The FDA will now decide on whether or not to issue an emergency use authorization for the vaccine . 
The FDA EUA allows shipping to begin , but shots still ca not be administered until the CDC advisory committee recommends the vaccine . 
Operation Warp Speed officials say they will start shipping the vaccine within 24 hours of FDA authorization . 
The CDC committee meeting : In anticipation of an EUA , the CDC 's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has scheduled emergency meetings for Friday and Sunday . 
This committee — which is separate from FDA 's advisory committee — will recommend whether the CDC should offer the vaccine to the American public . 
The committee is expected to vote on Sunday . 
Administering vaccines : After the CDC accepts that recommendation , Pfizer shots may start to be administered . 
An important note : An EUA is short of a full approval . 
Pfizer would have to file a separate application for full FDA approval for its vaccine .
