School closures of two to four weeks are unlikely to have an impact on mitigating the spread of the coronavirus and may negatively impact older caregivers at home , according to guidelines release by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The CDC said longer closures of eight weeks or more may have an impact on mitigating the spread though any closure would mean students could congregate with others outside of school , where they may still spread the disease . 
The CDC acknowledged there would be a significant negative impact on academic outcomes with longer closures . 
The Department of Education recently issued guidance to schools about certain flexibilities it could waive in regards to student absences and testing standards .
