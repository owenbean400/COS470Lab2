US President Donald Trump again contradicted his own health officials ' coronavirus statements -- this time on the importance of mask wearing and the timing for a vaccine . 
And he demeaned Dr . Robert Redfield , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , saying the doctor was " confused " in his congressional testimony . 
Redfield said Wednesday that masks may be a more effective protection against coronavirus than any potential vaccine that the President ca not stop hyping . 
And he laid out a timeline for when the general US public could expect to start seeing results from widespread coronavirus vaccination in the second or third quarter of 2021 . 
Those statements both seemed to contradict what Trump has been saying . 
Redfield told the Senate Appropriations Committee Wednesday : " If you 're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public , so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life , I think we 're probably looking at third , late second quarter , third quarter 2021 . " 
The President told reporters Redfield was " confused " when he said that . 
The President also said Redfield 's comments to Congress about masks possibly being more effective than a vaccine were incorrect and that Redfield may have misunderstood the question .
