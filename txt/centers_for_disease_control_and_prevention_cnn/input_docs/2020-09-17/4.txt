Despite President Trump appearing to undermine him on the issues of masks and vaccine timing , Dr . Robert Redfield has given no indications that he might resign — or has even considered resigning — as the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a federal health official close to the situation tells CNN . 
The official said Redfield is " taking it in stride " and focused on the work at hand , a day after Trump 's comments at the briefing . 
What this is all about : Redfield said in a Senate hearing yesterday that the American public could expect to start seeing results from widespread coronavirus vaccination in the second or third quarter of 2021 . 
Even if a vaccine for Covid 19 was released today , it would take six to nine months for enough people to receive it to create immunity , he said . 
Later in the day , the President told reporters Redfield was " confused " when he said that . 
" I think he made a mistake when he said that . 
It 's just incorrect information , " Trump said . 
Redfield also said masks may be a more effective protection against coronavirus than any potential vaccine that the President ca not stop hyping . 
" " I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine , because the immunogenicity may be 70 % . 
And if I do not get an immune response , the vaccine is not going to protect me . 
This face mask will , " he said . 
Later , the President said Redfield 's comments were incorrect and that Redfield may have misunderstood the question . 
" Maybe he misunderstood it , " Trump said , later adding , " As far as the masks are concerned , I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks . "
