Sunday was expected to be the busiest US domestic air travel day of the entire pandemic -- even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans not travel for Thanksgiving . 
Roughly 6 million travelers passed through security at US airports after the CDC 's travel warning in the week leading up to Thanksgiving . 
But it will be weeks before anyone knows how much of a role Thanksgiving gatherings and travel play in new hospitalizations and deaths . 
" When you look at people who are hospitalized today , they were infected two weeks ago , maybe more , " said Dr . Jonathan Reiner , a professor of medicine at George Washington University . 
" And then it takes usually another week for folks to succumb to the illness . " 
So infections picked up on Thanksgiving " are going to show up in three weeks and are going to show up in deaths over Christmas and New Year 's and are going to spread in every state , " Ranney said . 
Statistics reported in the days after the holiday might show a relative dip in Covid 19 cases , followed by a surge due to a lag in government agencies ' reporting over the long weekend .
