CVS and Walgreens are preparing to be among the first to administer Covid 19 shots in the United States , if the US Food and Drug Administration authorizes emergency use of a vaccine . 
Those vaccinations would take place in long term care facilities , not in retail stores . 
In October , the Trump administration announced agreements with CVS and Walgreens to give vaccinations to residents of long term care facilities nationwide . 
Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called an emergency meeting tomorrow to vote , in part , on whether to recommend that residents in those facilities be among the first people in the US to get a coronavirus vaccine . 
CVS anticipates providing shots in long term care facilities in mid December . 
Walgreens expects to begin administering shots in long term care facilities within days of receiving doses . 
" We are committed to administering vaccines to long term care facilities as soon as we receive doses . 
We believe we can be in some long term care facilities within a few days of when we receive the first vaccine doses , " a Walgreens corporate spokesperson told CNN Monday .
