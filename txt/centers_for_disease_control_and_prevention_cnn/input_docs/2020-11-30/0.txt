Pharmaceutical company Moderna this morning announced it intends to apply today to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its Covid 19 vaccine . 
That means there will be at least two vaccine candidates seeking FDA approval : Earlier this month , Pfizer and Bio NTech submitted for emergency use authorization for their coronavirus candidate . 
Here 's where things stand on the race to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine : When a vaccine could be approved : The FDA plans to make a decision about authorizing Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine within a few weeks of a key meeting scheduled for Dec . 10 , an agency official said last week . 
Who might get a vaccine first : Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called an emergency meeting for tomorrow to vote on who they recommend should be the first to get a coronavirus vaccine once one is authorized . 
The CDC has already recommended that the first group — designated as 1a — should include frontline health providers and support personnel . 
The 1a group likely should also include residents of nursing homes and other long term care facilities , who have been badly hit by the pandemic , the CDC has said . 
How many doses there could be : The federal government has said 40 million coronavirus vaccine doses could be available by the end of December . 
Dr . Larry Corey of the University of Washington , who is heading up coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in the US , has said if both Pfizer and Moderna get vaccines authorized , they could supply 50 million more doses in January and 60 million more in February and March . 
But remember : There are not going to be enough vaccines for everyone at first , so choices have to be made . 
The CDC estimates there are 21 million healthcare personnel , 87 million essential workers , 100 million adults with high risk medical conditions and 53 million others 65 and older .
