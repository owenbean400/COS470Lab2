Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta during the CITIZEN by CNN event on Tuesday that you can assume aerosols are a component of Covid 19 transmission . 
And while the amount they contribute to the spread it is not yet known , it does not change what has been said . 
" You can make a reasonable assumption , Sanjay , that some aspect of transmission can be and is by aerosol , " he said . 
" The interesting thing about that – it does not change anything that we ’ve been saying . 
It means wear your mask . 
It means avoid close contact . 
It means avoid crowds . 
And it means what we ’ve been saying , the third or fourth thing that I mentioned to you just a little while ago , is that outdoors is better than indoors , " he said – because if there is aerosol indoors , there can be some recirculation . 
Fauci said there have been some case reports of situations in places such as restaurants , " where it looks like it almost had to be an aerosol spread . " 
Remember : The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly reverted to its previous guidance about how coronavirus is transmitted , after saying on Friday that the virus can spread through the air .
