The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly dropped new guidance from its website about airborne transmission of the coronavirus yesterday , just days after publishing it . 
The agency said a draft version was posted in error , before it had gone through the normal review process , and reverted to its previous guidance , which does not mention airborne transmission . 
The back and forth by America 's top health authority is confusing and worrying . 
Scientists have been calling for the risk of airborne transmission to be recognized by health authorities . 
Evidence shows the virus is primarily spread through droplets that come out of people 's mouths and noses . 
Large droplets fall onto surfaces rapidly and can be picked up on fingers and carried to the eyes , nose or mouth . 
That 's why it 's important people do not touch their faces and wash their hands regularly . 
But there is now more evidence that smaller sized droplets can remain in the air in the form of aerosol particles which can be inhaled . 
Several international health authorities have already acknowledged this way of transmission , stressing the need to wear masks . 
A federal official familiar with the situation told CNN the guidance is " getting revised , " but did not say when the update would be posted to the CDC website . 
Researchers and doctors said they were glad to see CDC was expected to acknowledge airborne transmission , but some worried the back and forth could cause more confusion about how the virus spreads and what measures will reduce the risk .
