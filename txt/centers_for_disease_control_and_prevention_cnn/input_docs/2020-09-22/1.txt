The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has issued its first guidance for the holidays , including Halloween , while the coronavirus pandemic rages on . 
Most traditional activities for Halloween , such as door to door trick or treating and costume parties , are discouraged this year due to the pandemic , the CDC said in a new posting on its website . 
The new guidance lists " low risk , moderate and higher risk activities " for celebrating All Hallow ’s Eve . 
Low risk activities include : carving pumpkins and decorating your home , outdoor scavenger hunts , virtual costume contests and hosting a movie night with household members . 
Moderate risk things to do include : so called " one way trick or treating " by exchanging goody bags placed at the end of a driveway or the edge of a yard , having a small group outside for an " open air costume parade " where participants are at least 6 feet apart or attending an outdoor costume party where masks are worn and people social distance . 
Higher risk activities the CDC is urging against include : door to door trick or treating , attending crowded , indoor costume parties , visiting indoor haunted houses or going on hayrides or tractor rides with strangers . 
The agency is also discouraging : the use of costume masks this year , saying they are not a substitute for cloth masks . 
It is also warning against wearing a costume mask over a protective cloth , pointing out it ’s dangerous because it might make it hard to breath .
