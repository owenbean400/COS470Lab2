A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee is expected to delay a vote about how to prioritize who will receive a coronavirus vaccine first , according to a committee member . 
The CDC ’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had been expected to vote Tuesday on a plan to guide states in deciding who should first receive limited supplies of a vaccine once one is approved . 
However , that vote was delayed while the committee ’s working group studies the issue further , according to Dr . William Schaffner , an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a member of the committee . 
Schaffner , a member of ACIP ’s Covid 19 vaccines working group , said there ’s general agreement among the group that frontline health care workers should be the first to receive the vaccine . 
He said it ’s unclear whether the next group should be people who are at high risk for Covid 19 complications , such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions , or if it should be essential workers . 
Schaffner said he did not know when the working group will come up with a plan for who should get the vaccine first . 
" I ’m sure the states would be assisted in their planning if they could rather quickly be given a prioritization scheme , " he said . 
The news of the delay was first reported by The Wall Street Journal .
