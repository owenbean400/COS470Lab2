Divisive politics in the United States are getting in the way of consistent messaging on the coronavirus , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday night . 
Noah asked about the inconsistent messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and why the US does not have a centralized source of information like other countries . 
" That 's a difficult question to give a satisfactory explanation for because , as a matter of fact , there , you know there has been switches in how the messages have gone out , " Fauci responded " From a research and public health standpoint , I try my best . and I think I 'm successful in giving a consistent message as often as I can get the message out . " 
Americans want to get the economy open and people back to work , the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said . 
Public health measures should be " a gateway and a pathway to opening the country as opposed to an obstacle to opening the country . " 
" So what has evolved now is that almost people take sides like wearing a mask or not is a political statement and that â€™s really unfortunate , totally unfortunate because this is purely a public health issue . 
It should not be one against the other . " 
Fauci said when messages get thrown into " political buckets , " then " you do not have a single message . " 
Fauci said he has never had a political ideology that he has made public : " I 'm really just talking to you about public health . "
