The Utah Jazz said all of their players and team personnel , including center Rudy Gobert and guard Donovan Mitchell , have completed their self isolation period and are medically cleared by the Utah Department of Health . 
Earlier this month , Gobert and Mitchell became the most high profile athletes known to have been diagnosed with Covid 19 . 
On March 11 , the Jazz were set to play the Oklahoma City Thunder before it was ultimately postponed because of coronavirus fears â€“ prompting NBA commissioner Adam Silver to suspend the NBA season . 
The team says the players have been in isolation/quarantine since the season was postponed . 
After being medically cleared , all players and staff will continue to practice distancing while limiting their time outside to essential activities as recommended by the NBA and CDC .
