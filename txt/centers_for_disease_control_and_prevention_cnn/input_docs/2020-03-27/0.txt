R . Kelly ’s attorneys have filed a motion asking for the singer to be released on bond because , they argue , Kelly is within the group that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has categorized as " most at risk for contracting COVID 19 . " 
Kelly ’s lawyers say that if bond were granted , he would be placed on home incarceration and would be electronically monitored . 
The singer is currently being detained at the Chicago MCC where he is awaiting trial for multiple sexual abuse charges .
