Vice President Mike Pence said more than 685,000 coronavirus tests have been completed in the United States as of Friday morning . 
Pence said that hospitals across the country are now reporting their testing numbers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Federal Emergency Management Agency in real time , something that was not the case when testing first began . 
However , those numbers are not being reflected on the CDC ’s US testing page , which paints a far different picture . 
The CDC 's number are lower because they ’re not reporting out data from private or commercial labs .
