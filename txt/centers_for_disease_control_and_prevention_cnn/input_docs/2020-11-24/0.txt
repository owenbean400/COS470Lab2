Millions of Americans are traveling for Thanksgiving this week and Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Monday that he is worried . 
" What most concerns me now is , you know , the immediate situation with people traveling from different places , coming home for Thanksgiving , " Fauci said during an interview with the PBS Newshour . 
Fauci said he has other worries , too . 
Numbers of cases , hospitalizations and deaths are all growing , Fauci pointed out . 
" Superimpose upon that that as we get further into the late fall and early winter with the weather being colder , forcing more people throughout most regions of the country to do things indoors more than outdoors â€” this is something that , you know , at obviously at face value is a very , very challenging situation , " he said . 
The infectious disease expert said people who have decided to travel this week " are putting themselves and their families at risk . " 
Much of the time , people who are infected with Covid 19 but have no symptoms and are responsible for community spread , Fauci said . 
" So what we ask people to do is to at least , stop for a moment and do what I call a risk benefit assessment of what you want to do in the holiday , what you want to do for the season where you bring people in your home , " he said . 
If you have elderly people in your home or individuals with underlying health conditions , Fauci suggested , you should really weigh hosting a celebration this year . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week advised Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving this year because of the surging pandemic .
