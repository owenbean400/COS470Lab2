Dr . Leana Wen , an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University has criticized US President Donald Trump ’s event in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday , saying , " If I were to custom design a super spreader event , this is what it would look like . " 
Trump administration 's top health officials , as well as other attendees , were seen not wearing masks or social distancing at Trump 's Supreme Court nomination announcement . 
Speaking to CNN ’s Ana Cabrera , Wen , who was previously Baltimore 's health commissioner , said she was " very concerned " about the video she saw showing " a lot of people coming from many parts of the country , gathered together , no social distancing , not wearing masks . " 
" Because it 's not just what they do during the event , " Wen said , but what happens when they return home and potentially spread the virus . 
Alex Azar , secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , attended the event and was seen un masked and fist bumping people . 
" He represents all the agencies that fall under HHS -- the CDC , the FDA , the NIH -- all these top scientists and public health officials , " Wen said . 
" What 's going through their minds as they 're watching their leader flaunt the very advice that they 're giving ? " 
Wen continued : " Also , the Secretary is a member of the President 's Cabinet , and he has a responsibility to represent that public health guidance to the President . 
So , it also is sending the wrong message to the President , when this cabinet secretary in charge of health and public health is not following these very guidelines . " 
" He should be modeling the type of behavior that we expect everyone to have at this point , " she added .
