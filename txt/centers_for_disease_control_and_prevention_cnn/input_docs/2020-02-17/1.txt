Concerns are mounting about how long the novel coronavirus may survive on surfaces — so much so that China 's central bank has taken measures to deep clean and destroy its cash , which changes hands multiple times a day , in an effort to contain the virus . 
It is unknown exactly how long the novel coronavirus can linger on contaminated surfaces and objects with the potential of infecting people , but some researchers are finding clues by studying the elusive behaviors of other coronaviruses . 
About the virus : Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals . 
In rare cases , they are what scientists call zoonotic , meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Officials do not know what animal may have caused the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan , China . 
But previously , studies have suggested that people were infected with the coronavirus MERS , or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome , after coming in contact with camels , and scientists have suspected that civet cats were to blame for SARS , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome . 
These human coronaviruses , such as SARS and MERS , have been found to persist on inanimate surfaces — including metal , glass or plastic surfaces — for as long as nine days if that surface had not been disinfected , according to research published earlier this month in The Journal of Hospital Infection . 
Cleaning with common household products can make a difference , according to the research , which also found that human coronaviruses " can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71 % ethanol , 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite " or bleach within one minute .
