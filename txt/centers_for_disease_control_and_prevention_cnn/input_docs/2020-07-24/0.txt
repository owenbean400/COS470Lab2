One of the real problems that could occur as schools reopen this fall for in person learning is the spread of Covid 19 to older people , Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said . 
Gates ' comments follow new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on education and childcare that favor the opening schools , saying children do not suffer much from coronavirus , are less likely than adults to spread it , and suffer from being out of school . 
Gates was heartened over the news that " there 's likely to be money for schools on a bipartisan basis in this next bill , because funding some of that and spreading best practices there will mean we can reduce the education deficit . " 
More on the CDC guidelines : The new CDC guidelines posted Thursday do recommend that local officials should consider closing schools , or keeping them closed , if there is substantial , uncontrolled transmission of the virus . 
The CDC has been promising new guidelines for more than a week , after demands from President Trump that the agency alter its recommendations for opening schools . 
They were posted on the agency â€™s website Thursday afternoon with little public notice and no explanation of what has been changed .
