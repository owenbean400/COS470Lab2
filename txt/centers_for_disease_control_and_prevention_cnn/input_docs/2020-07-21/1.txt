White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany disputed that the administration is blocking additional funds for testing and contact tracing as part of the phase four stimulus package . 
Mc Enany said that there is currently $ 10 billion dollars is unspent funds for testing , and in the phase four negotiations , the administration wants to " make sure there is money that is targeted for money that makes the most sense . " 
" We â€™re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense , not just dumping money into a pot that already contains $ 10 billion dollars , " she added . 
Republican Sens . 
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , Susan Collins of Maine , Bill Cassidy of Louisiana , Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and others stressed to reporters on Monday that more money for testing is essential in the next stimulus , breaking with the White House posture that more money for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for contact tracing and testing should not be included in the next round of aid .
