The anticipated supplemental guidance for safely reopening schools , from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , has been cleared after a federal review process – but officials at the public health agency were given no indication as to when the recommendations would be released , a senior CDC official tells CNN . 
As of Sunday , the CDC documents had been cleared by the interagency Office of Management and Budget , according to the senior CDC official . 
Last week , the science behind the supplemental guidance was questioned by Dr . Deborah Birx , causing delay , the official said . 
Although the CDC documents have now cleared the hurdle , the senior official did not know when they would be published . 
" There ’s still no word on when our documents will come out , " the senior official said . 
Meanwhile , the White House workgroup , which was created by Dr . Deborah Birx to work on new guidance in parallel with the CDC guidance on schools , is still working on its own set of documents , the official said . 
Officials at the CDC were largely kept in the dark about what recommendations will come from the White House workgroup . 
An official close to the Coronavirus Task Force tells CNN that there are five different documents of guidance – but they all need to come out at once to make sense . 
Some have been approved ; some have not , according to the official , who added that the guidance will ideally be released as a package deal – with the hope no later than this Friday . 
Some US schools are set to start their new school year in just two weeks .
