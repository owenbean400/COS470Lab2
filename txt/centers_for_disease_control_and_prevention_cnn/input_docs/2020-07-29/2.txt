Last week , Rep . 
Chip Roy , a Republican from Texas , was on the House floor interacting at length with Rep . 
Louie Gohmert who has since tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Neither men were wearing masks . 
Today , Roy was in the House and wearing a mask . 
He said he is not going to isolate and was not worried about contracting the virus . 
Roy says he 's not concerned " anymore than the interactions with perfect strangers on an airplane with circulating air . 
With cotton masks on an airplane , where everybody is pretending like they 're doing something noble to try to save people from a virus on a cylinder with 50 people on it flying through the air . " 
" My question to you all is how are people wearing a cotton mask on an airplane saving you from circulating virus on an airplane ? " he added . 
Roy contended he 's " happy to wear a mask " and is not skeptical of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but questioned whether a " thin piece of cotton " on someone 's face — often with a valve — is enough to prevent the virus from spreading . 
He argued there are doctors who raise questions about the effectiveness . 
" But my question here is we act like wearing this thin piece of cotton , then everybody gets the blessing that they 're somehow saving everybody , " he said .
