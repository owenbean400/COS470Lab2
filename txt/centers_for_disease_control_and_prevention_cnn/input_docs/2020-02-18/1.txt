After a two week quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan , some American passengers were sent back to the states . 
However , for some of the 13 who either tested positive or had a high likelihood of testing positive , they must make one more stop in Nebraska . 
They 're heading to the Omaha based Nebraska Medicine/University of Nebraska Medical Center ( UNMC ) . 
The unit is no stranger to treating patients with difficult diseases . 
The special 10 bed biocontainment unit is a state of the art facility that has been doing this kind of complicated work for nearly 15 years . 
It is a secured area with its own ventilation system that is isolated from the rest of the hospital and is staffed by people with specialized training in communicable diseases . 
It had been commissioned by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2005 . 
In 2014 , the unit successfully treated three patients with Ebola , including Dr . Rick Sacra , an American physician from Massachusetts who got sick while working with Ebola patients in Africa .
