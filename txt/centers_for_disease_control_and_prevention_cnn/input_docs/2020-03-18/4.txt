The World Health Organization did not offer Covid 19 tests to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told CNN on Tuesday . 
There were no discussions between the WHO and CDC on providing tests , according to Jasarevic , who added that the US typically has the capacity to manufacture its own tests , so it does not usually rely on the WHO for them . 
Separate manufacturers : On January 17 , the WHO published a protocol from German researchers with the instructions necessary for any country to manufacture coronavirus tests . 
The US pursued its own design and began testing for the coronavirus at the CDC in Atlanta . 
On February 5 , the CDC announced it would begin shipping test kits to public health labs in the US . 
One day later , the WHO said it had shipped 250,000 tests to more than 70 laboratories around the world . 
Delays and stumbles in US testing : Days after CDC â€™s tests shipped , some labs reported that the test kits were not working as expected , which eventually required tests to be re manufactured . 
On March 1 , an official at US Health and Human Services said the agency had launched an investigation into a manufacturing defect in the CDC tests . 
As of March 9 , public health labs in all 50 states and Washington , DC , are able to test for the coronavirus .
