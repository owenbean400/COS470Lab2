The NBA 's Brooklyn Nets said Wednesday that the team was prompted to administer a test for COVID 19 after several players and staff had shown symptoms . 
The team also added that they " sourced the tests through a private company and paid for them ourselves because we did not want to impact access to CDC â€™s public resources . 
Using the test results , we were able to take immediate precautions and strictly isolate the players who tested positive . " 
The Nets announced on Tuesday that four players had tested positive for COVID 19 , most notably superstar Kevin Durant . 
So far seven NBA players have tested positive for coronavirus .
