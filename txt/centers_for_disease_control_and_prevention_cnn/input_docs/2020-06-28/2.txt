Former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Tom Frieden said on Fox News that although the US is doing more testing and hospitals are better prepared , " this virus still has the upper hand . " 
The increase in cases in Southern states is the result of reopening too fast and it " is going to continue to get worse for weeks , " Frieden said . 
Frieden said the deaths will lag cases of infections by about a month . 
And while the increase in cases appears to be in younger populations , Frieden said " what starts in young adults does not stay in young adults . " 
Frieden estimated that in the next month , the US will see at least 15,000 more deaths from Covid 19 . 
He also said cases will continue to rise .
