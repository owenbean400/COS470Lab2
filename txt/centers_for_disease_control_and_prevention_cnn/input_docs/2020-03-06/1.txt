Coronavirus screening got off to " a slow start " and there were some " missteps " with regard to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s test , but the problems have been addressed , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said at CNN ’s town hall tonight . 
By the end of the week or the beginning of next week , the CDC should be able to get out about 75,000 additional tests . 
Partnering with the private sector will help get out millions more , Fauci said . 
To get a fuller picture of the coronavirus , the US needs testing that is " much more proactive , " not just when doctors ask for it , Fauci said . 
This will help determine how much the disease has spread and how many cases are going undetected . 
" For that reason , we ’re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests , " Fauci said . 
" That ’s what I feel and that ’s what many of my colleagues feel . "
