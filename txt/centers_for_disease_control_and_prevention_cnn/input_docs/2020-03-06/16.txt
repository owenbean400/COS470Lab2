The Ultra Music Festival and the Calle Ocho Festival have been postponed due to fears and concerns about the coronavirus , according to officials from the City of Miami . 
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said the cancelations should not cause " panic " as the decision was made as a " precaution " and following CDC guidelines for large gatherings . 
Ultra is a 3 day electronic dance music festival that was founded in 1999 and takes place in the heart of downtown Miami . 
This year 210 performing artists were expected to take the stage and organizers were expecting fans from 105 countries . 
The Calle Ocho Music Festival is an event that spans 20 blocks and 10 stages of music and entertainment in Little Havana . 
According to Suarez , the economic impact of these cancellations is unclear .
