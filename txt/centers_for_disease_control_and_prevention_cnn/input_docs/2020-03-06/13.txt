Test results taken from 45 people aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship are expected Friday , the ship ’s operator Princess Cruises said in a statement on Thursday night . 
The samples , collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and local authorities , are from both passengers and crew members . 
They were delivered to the state ’s public health department lab in Richmond , according to the statement . 
All guests on the ship have been asked to stay in their rooms while test results are pending . 
Guests are receiving meal deliveries by room service , they added . 
Princess Cruises is the operator of the Diamond Princess , another cruise liner which was quarantined for weeks in Japan last month . 
Hundreds of people onboard that ship tested positive for the virus . 
A top Japanese government adviser admitted in February that the quarantine measures enacted may have allowed additional infections to spread among the ship 's crew and passengers .
