Slack , the workplace chat app , is encouraging employees to work remotely today after learning that one of its San Francisco based employees could potentially have been exposed to coronavirus . 
According to a statement from Slack â€™s SVP of People , Robby Kwok , the employee was notified by the CDC they had been in an area with potential exposure while traveling overseas . 
" This employee has not been confirmed to have contracted COVID 19 and has not reported any symptoms , " said Kwok , who noted that because the employee was the office after returning from the trip , the company is closing both of its San Francisco offices this afternoon and deep cleaning this weekend . 
" The health and safety of our employees is our number one priority . 
Again , we are taking these actions out of an abundance of caution , " added Kwok .
