Another audience member at CNN 's town hall asked why the US has not implemented aggressive testing measures like South Korea has . 
South Korea has drive through testing sites : CNN correspondent Ivan Watson visited one of these sites , where people can get tested in a matter of minutes without ever leaving their car . 
It 's hugely efficient : That one drive through test site can process more than 300 people a day , Watson said . 
Seoul , the national capital , now has at least three of these drive through testing centers . 
" More than 150,000 people have been tested here , " Watson said . 
" I think this is an example of how amid this public health crisis , people are coming up with ideas . 
They are adapting . " 
The US is lagging behind in testing : Only about 1,500 tests have been run in the US , compared to thousands a day in South Korea , said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta . 
There are a few reasons for the delay â€” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched its roll out of testing , and some in the medical field have complained about strict rules on who is allowed testing . 
In many places , only those presenting severe symptoms are encouraged to get tested , even though there may be many more asymptomatic patients .
