The UK coronavirus variant has not been identified through sequencing efforts in the United States , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a scientific brief posted on its website Tuesday . 
However , it says , only about 51,000 of 17 million US cases it has tallied have been sequenced â€” less than half a percent . 
The agency says : " CDC is monitoring the situation in the UK and communicating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control . 
CDC and state and local health departments are continually monitoring and studying the virus spreading in the United States to quickly detect any changes . " 
Last month , the agency launched a " strain surveillance program " " that it expects to be " fully implemented " in January ; it will include states sending at least 10 samples biweekly for analysis .
