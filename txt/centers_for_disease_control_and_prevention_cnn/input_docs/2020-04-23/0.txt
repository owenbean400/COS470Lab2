Alarming new signs are emerging that the Trump administration is shunting science aside in the battle against coronavirus . 
In Wednesday 's most stunning development , a top administration official working on a vaccine claimed he was ousted after resisting efforts to push unproven drugs promoted by US President Donald Trump and his conservative media cheerleaders as " game changer " treatments . 
That news was followed by a bewilderingly inconsistent White House briefing . 
Conflicting messages on when to reboot the economy , the need for testing and the possibility of a resurgence of the virus combined with Trump 's effort to suppress facts that jar with his insistence that the end of a nightmare likely to last many more months is near . 
In another bizarre twist , Trump produced Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , to walk back his remarks that the coronavirus challenge could be more difficult in the fall . 
Trump claimed that Redfield had been " totally misquoted " by the media . 
But under questioning from reporters , Redfield confirmed that he had in fact made the remarks that angered Trump . 
It accurately described Redfield warning that if a coronavirus resurgence came at the same time as the flu season , hospitals could be overwhelmed . 
The President also openly clashed with his top public health officials on the likelihood of the virus returning for another assault in the fall -- saying only " embers " of disease were likely that could be easily put out . 
The President did break with Georgia 's Republican Gov . 
Brian Kemp , saying he " strongly disagrees " with aggressive plans to open businesses including hair salons on Friday as pro Trump southern states look to ease stay at home orders .
