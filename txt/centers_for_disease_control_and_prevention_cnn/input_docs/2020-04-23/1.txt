The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clarified comments he made to the Washington Post about how the second coronavirus outbreak could emerge this winter in conjunction with the flu season to make for an even more dire health crisis . 
" There 's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through , " CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a story published Tuesday . 
" And when I 've said this to others , they kind of put their head back , they do not understand what I mean . " 
Speaking at the White House on Wednesday , Redfield said that the second wave " could be more difficult , more complicated " and not " worse . "
