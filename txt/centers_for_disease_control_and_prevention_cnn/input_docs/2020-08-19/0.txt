Massachusetts said Wednesday it would require all schoolchildren to get influenza vaccines to stay enrolled in public schools and daycares , making it the first state to require flu shots for children over the age of 5 . 
Most states require that children get the 16 recommended childhood vaccines to attend public schools , but the influenza vaccine , which must be given freshly every year , has been an exception . 
Public health officials including US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield have been urging all Americans to get vaccinated against flu this year so the virus does not further complicate the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . 
" Students will be expected to have received a flu vaccine by December 31 , 2020 for the 2020-2021 influenza season , unless either a medical or religious exemption is provided , " the Massachusetts health department said . 
" Also exempted are K 12 students who are homeschooled and higher education students who are completely off campus and engaged in remote learning only , " the department added . 
The CDC estimates that 600 children died of flu during the 2017-2018 flu season . 
" Every year , thousands of people of all ages are affected by influenza , leading to many hospitalizations and deaths , " Dr . Larry Madoff , medical director of the state â€™s Bureau of Infectious Disease , said in a statement . 
" It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID 19 and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve healthcare resources . "
