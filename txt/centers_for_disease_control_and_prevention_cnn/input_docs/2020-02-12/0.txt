Illinois is the first state with the capability to test patients for the novel coronavirus , according to an announcement Tuesday by the Illinois Department of Public Health . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which previously had the only lab in the country that could test for the virus , began shipping test kits to domestic and international labs last week . 
The test can yield results within 24 hours of receiving samples . 
The state health department is receiving specimens at its laboratory in Chicago and says that two more , in Springfield and Carbondale , are forthcoming . 
Some background : Illinois has so far documented two confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus , out of the current total of 13 in the United States . 
Last week , the CDC said it planned to distribute roughly 200 test kits to domestic labs and another 200 to international labs . 
Each test kit can perform 700 to 800 patient samples . 
The test is known as a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test ( RT PCR ) and can detect the virus from nasal or oral swabs when used with an existing RT PCR instrument — the same one often used to test for seasonal influenza , according to the CDC . 
Negative results do not preclude infection with the virus and should be combined with clinical observations , patient history and epidemiological information , health officials have said . 
According to numbers published Monday , the CDC has investigated 398 people for the novel coronavirus in 37 states since January 21 . 
Most of these people — 318 — have tested negative , and 68 are still pending . 
The agency is expected to update its " people under investigation " case count later today .
