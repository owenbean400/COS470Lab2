The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now screened more than 30,000 passengers from China at the 11 airports designated to conduct these enhanced screenings , according to Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC â€™s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases . 
On a call with reporters Wednesday , Messonnier said that with the tighter travel restrictions now in place , there are now fewer passengers flying to the United States from China . 
Those who do are still being asked to self monitor for 14 days in cooperation with state and local health department , and to limit their activities and stay home during that period . 
The goal is to be as restrictive as possible while maintaining protections among all Americans , Messonnier said . 
The latest update from the CDC , issued within the last hour , indicated that 420 people have now been investigated for the novel coronavirus in 41 states . 
Of them , 13 have tested positive , 327 negative and 60 are still pending . 
The vast majority of cases have been in mainland China .
