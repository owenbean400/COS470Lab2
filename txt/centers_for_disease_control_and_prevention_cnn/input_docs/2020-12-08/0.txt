It â€™s unclear whether Americans who have had coronavirus and have antibodies to the virus should get a Covid 19 vaccine when one becomes available , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Monday . 
" That 's something that the FDA ( United States Food and Drug Administration ) has not ruled on and CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) has not ruled on , yet , in terms of providing guidance , " Azar said during an interview with NBC News host Lester Holt . 
Azar clarified that he was not saying people who have had the virus and recovered either should or should not get vaccinated . 
In fact , it came up at an Operation Warp Speed meeting Monday , according to US Surgeon Gen . Dr . Jerome Adams . 
" Right now we do not know how long people 's antibodies are going to last , " Adams said in an interview with Fox News Monday . 
" And we know that in the studies they vaccinated people who did have antibodies , and so it 's not going to harm you , based on what we know about the vaccines , if you 've had the virus and you get vaccinated again . " 
Adams encouraged people who have recovered to donate plasma . 
" Convalescent plasma is a treatment out there that has potential to really help individuals recover if they 've gotten Covid , particularly in this surge , " he added .
