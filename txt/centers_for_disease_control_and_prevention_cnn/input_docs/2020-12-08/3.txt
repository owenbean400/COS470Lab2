The US federal government ’s goal is to make coronavirus vaccines like getting a flu shot , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Monday . 
" We distribute over 90 million vaccines a year that are ( included in ) CDC ’s Vaccines for Children program , " Azar said in an interview with Axios . 
Azar said the government ’s Covid 19 vaccine distribution plan includes " leveraging what works using the familiar names , the Walgreens , CVS , the hospitals , the community health centers that we have . " 
Azar predicted vaccine hesitancy will decrease and confidence will increase over time . 
The United Kingdom gave emergency authorization to Pfizer ’s Covid 19 vaccine last week and will begin rolling out the shots Tuesday . 
" The American people , that should bring reassurance to them . 
A highly separate process has also validated this and I 've made clear there are five independent checks in the system that we have built to ensure there is no politicization of the vaccine program here , " Azar said . 
Azar said he expects a Covid 19 vaccine to be widely available across the US by the second quarter of 2021 . 
" My expectation is that next year we return to normalcy in our lives , thanks to the incredible work of Operation Warp Speed and these vaccines , as well as the therapeutics , " he said .
