A top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who has been largely silenced through the pandemic spoke out Monday and said she hopes her agency will be able to communicate more openly next year and regain the public ’s trust . 
Messonnier , the director of the CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , has in past disease outbreaks and epidemics been front and center briefing reporters and the public about diseases and the efforts to fight them . 
She has barely been seen since she last briefed reporters in March . 
Asked about this , Messonnier said she hoped that would change . 
Many public health experts have complained that the Trump administration has sidelined the CDC and its usual role in educating the public about disease outbreaks . 
President elect Joe Biden has pledged to take the coronavirus pandemic response in a dramatically different direction .
