The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Dr . Tom Clark said that as of Saturday , at least 272,001 doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine have been administered in the United States During a meeting of the CDC ’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , Clark said that the number was a " minimal estimate , " since there is a lag time in reporting . 
Providers are requested to report how many people have been given a vaccine within 72 hours to their local public health office . 
The public health office then has an additional 24 hours to report that number to the CDC .
