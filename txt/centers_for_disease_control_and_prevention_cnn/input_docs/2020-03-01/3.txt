The United States ' top doctor has one simple request : Stop buying face masks . 
US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams ' message , posted to Twitter on Saturday , was a response to face mask shortages as people stock up due to coronavirus concerns . 
Washing your hands , staying home when sick and other " everyday preventive actions " are the best protections , Adams said . 
He urged people to get a flu shot , as fewer flu patients means more resources to fight the coronavirus . 
The tweet comes during what has become a mask boom . 
With more coronavirus cases popping up in the United States , some have started buying face masks as a form of protection -- despite the likes of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Vice President Mike Pence saying they 're unnecessary . 
And , like Adams points out , if these masks run out , they wo not be available to the medical professionals who are at the highest risk for disease transmission .
