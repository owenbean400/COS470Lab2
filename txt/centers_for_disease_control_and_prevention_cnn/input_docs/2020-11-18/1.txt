Millions of children have missed routine vaccinations during the Covid 19 pandemic , and that is putting the US at risk from diseases like measles , whooping cough and polio , according to new data from Blue Cross Blue Shield Association released Wednesday . 
Children are on track to miss an estimated 9 million doses of vaccine in 2020 , an up to 26 % decrease compared to 2019 , according to the association â€™s survey of medical claims . 
Forty percent of parents and legal guardians said the pandemic made them miss routine vaccinations for their children . 
The majority of these happened during two time periods : March through May and August . 
The measles vaccine rate is down 26 % from 2019 , whooping cough immunizations are down 26 % and polio vaccination is down 16 % , the release said . 
" The new BCBSA vaccine data , based on medical claims from millions of Blue Cross and Blue Shield ( BCBS ) members , provides clear evidence that the United States is at risk of widespread outbreaks of preventable disease , " the group said in a statement . 
" If current trends continue , the U.S . would fall dangerously below the vaccination levels for measles and whooping cough that the CDC says are needed to protect community health . " 
The analysis of member claims data looked at vaccine doses delivered from January to September 2020 and compared that with the same period in 2019 .
