US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield said the agency has sent out new coronavirus testing guidance to health care workers on Thursday , after what might be the first US case of community spread of the virus . 
Earlier in the outbreak , CDC guidance to doctors in the US was that a patient had to have a travel history to China , among other criteria . 
But a patient at UC Davis Medical Center prompted the CDC to change its guidance . 
The patient that prompted the guidance change was transferred from another Northern California hospital last week . 
According to a letter from UC Davis Health , the patient " did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID 19 , a test was not immediately administered . " 
After doctors persisted in their request for the test , on Sunday , CDC went ahead with testing . 
On Wednesday , the CDC confirmed the patient tested positive for the coronavirus . 
That patient became the first US case of unknown origin , according to the CDC . 
The patient did not have any relevant travel history nor any exposure to another known patient . 
The patient may be the first US case of " community spread " of the virus , officials said . 
Redfield added : " This is a fluid situation . 
There â€™s a lot we do not know and we are learning more every day . "
