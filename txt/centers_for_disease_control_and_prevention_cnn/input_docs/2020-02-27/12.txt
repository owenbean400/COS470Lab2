Dr . Anne Schuchat , principal deputy director for the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention , said the US should expect to see more cases of coronavirus . 
Schuchat urged Americans to prepare for the virus as well as schools and businesses . 
" Tt 's the perfect time for businesses , health care systems , universities , and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans , dust them off , and make sure that they 're ready , " she said . 
She said the future is uncertain , but assured the public that steps have been taken to prepare for such outbreaks . 
" So , this â€” the trajectory of what we 're looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain . 
But many of the steps that we have taken over the past 15 years to prepare for pandemic influenza and our experience going through the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of influenza remind us of the kinds of steps our health care system , our businesses , our communities and schools may need to take , " Schuchat said .
