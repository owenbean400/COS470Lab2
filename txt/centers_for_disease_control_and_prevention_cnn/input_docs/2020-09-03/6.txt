The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's recent update to its testing guidelines " was clearly open to misinterpretation " and people who have been exposed to Covid 19 over a prolonged period of time should get tested whether they show symptoms or not , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases , told CNN 's Jim Sciutto . 
The CDC last week changed its Covid 19 testing guidelines to say some people without symptoms may not need to be tested , even if they 've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus . 
" Let 's clarify that : Community spread is important . 
People without symptoms do spread the infection and we should be testing people under certain circumstances who are without symptoms , no doubt about that , " Fauci said . 
" Right now certainly , if you have an actionable situation where there is an exposure that 's prolonged and consistent with someone who is infected and you are without symptoms you should get tested . "
