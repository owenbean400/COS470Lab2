The director of the National Institutes for Health , Dr . Francis Collins , said it ’s " unlikely " that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready by October . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told public health officials around the United States to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as soon as late October . 
It ’s also provided planning scenarios to help states prepare . 
" This is like the Boy Scout motto , ‘ Be Prepared , ’ " Collins said . 
" Even if it 's very low likelihood , if everything happened to come together really beautifully and we had an answer by then and we knew we had a vaccine that was safe and effective , would not you want people to be ready to figure out how to do the distribution ? 
That 's all that CDC is saying . " 
" Now keep in mind that the likelihood of that is pretty low , " Collins added . 
There are currently three vaccines in the US in phase 3 clinical trials .
