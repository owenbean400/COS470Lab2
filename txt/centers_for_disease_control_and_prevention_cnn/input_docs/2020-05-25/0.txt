The commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration on Sunday urged Americans observing Memorial Day weekend to follow federal guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus , saying the deadly virus " is not yet contained . " 
Some context : The commissioner 's Memorial Day warning comes as some states begin to reopen , allowing people to go to beaches , cookouts and bars as they observe one of the more popular holidays taking place amid the pandemic . 
But as social activities increase , health experts like Hahn warn the US is not out of the woods . 
" Even as states and some state officials rush to reopen it 's on us to make smart and safe decisions , " Dr . Seema Yasmin , a former disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told CNN Saturday night . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , told the public last week that going outside was fine , with cautious measures . 
" Go out , wear a mask , stay 6 feet away from anyone so you can have the physical distancing , " he told a CNN coronavirus town hall . 
" Go for a run . 
Go for a walk . 
Go fishing . 
As long as you 're not in a crowd and you 're not in a situation where you can physically transmit the virus . "
