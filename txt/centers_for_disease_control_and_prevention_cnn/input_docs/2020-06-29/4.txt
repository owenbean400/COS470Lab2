The extent of the spread of coronavirus across the US is discouraging and it could be difficult to control , Dr . Anne Schuchat , principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Monday . 
" What we hope is we can take it seriously and slow the transmission in these places , " Schuchat said at a JAMA Live event . 
" But what I think is very discouraging is we ’re clearly not at a point where there ’s so little virus being spread that it ’s going to be easy to snuff out . " 
While the spread of the virus cannot necessarily be stopped , it can be modified by personal behavior , Schuchat said . 
She said people need to continue to wear face coverings , practice good hand hygiene and socially distance to try to help slow and control the spread . 
" We just need to expect this virus to continue to circulate , but in terms of the weather or the season helping us , I do not think we can count on that , " Schuchat added .
