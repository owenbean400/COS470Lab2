Earlier in this pandemic , scientists did not know how easily this new virus spreads between people without symptoms , nor did they know how long infectious particles could linger in the air . 
There was also a shortage of N95 respirators and face masks among health care workers who were quickly overwhelmed with Covid 19 patients . 
But since then , the CDC , the US Surgeon General and other doctors have changed their recommendations and are now urging the widespread use of face masks . 
The CDC now says the public needs to " cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others . " 
Scientists have made many recent discoveries about this new coronavirus , including : It ’s easy to spread this virus by just talking or breathing .

Without mitigation efforts like stay at home orders , each person with coronavirus infects , on average , another two to three other people . 
That makes it twice as contagious as the flu . 
This virus has a long incubation period – up to 14 days – giving a wide window of opportunity for people to infect others before they even know they ’re infected . 
Carriers may be most contagious in the 48 hours before they get symptoms , making transmission even more blind .

It ’s often people who look completely normal and do not have a fever — and that could include you .
