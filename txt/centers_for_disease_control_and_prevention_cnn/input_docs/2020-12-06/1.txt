Moncef Slaoui , chief scientific advisor for Operation Warp Speed , told CNN on Sunday that he is hopeful that by the end of January , there should be a " quite significant " decrease in morbidity and mortality associate with the elderly population . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its advisory committee , ACIP , have recommended that the vaccine be used in health care workers and those in long term care facilities , Slaoui said , adding that , unfortunately , about 40 to 50 % of deaths are happening in the elderly population in care homes . 
The vaccine efficacy as it has been seen , he said , " actually starts reasonably quickly " after the first dose and is then maintained further with the second dose . 
" Therefore I â€™m hopeful that by the end of the month of January , we should already see quite a significant decrease in the mortality and severe morbidity associated in the elderly population " said Slaoui . 
He added that there are many other people who have comorbidities that live outside these facilities and that it will take more time to immunize them . 
" By the month , the middle of the month of March , we should have really covered most of the highly susceptible population , about 100 million people , " Slaoui said .
