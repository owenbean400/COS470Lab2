The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) and state regulators said that the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland , Washington -- the epicenter of the state 's novel coronavirus outbreak -- found that patients at the facility were in " imminent danger " during the beginning of the outbreak . 
CMS said in a statement that inspectors uncovered three so called " Immediate Jeopardy " situations -- when a patient ’s safety is placed in imminent danger -- after conducting inspections on March 16 . 
" Specifically , the facility ’s failure to rapidly identify and manage ill residents , notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infection among residents , and failure to possess a sufficient backup plan following the absence of the facility ’s primary clinician , who fell ill , " the statement read . 
Washington Department of Social and Health Services Secretary Cheryl Strange called the situation at the retirement facility " unprecedented . " 
She added : The agency said that according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 147 nursing homes across 27 states had reported at least one resident who had contracted the virus .
