About 1,900 students returned to Liberty University , a private evangelical Christian university , in Lynchburg , Virginia , a spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Tuesday . 
Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr . and other leaders discussed whether to extend spring break and " risk students having a longer time to become exposed to the virus , " the school said in a statement . 
It decided it was safer to bring the students back to campus . 
Falwell 's decision to bring students back to campus flies against the guidance provided by state officials and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Virginia Gov .

The order bans gatherings of more than 10 people and goes into effect just before midnight on Tuesday .
