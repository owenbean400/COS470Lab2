Pets might not infect people with coronavirus , but pet owners need to protect cats , dogs and other companion animals , the US Food and Drug Administration cautioned in a new You Tube video . 
The video pushes the " aww " button with images of adorable furry kittens , ferrets , puppies and loving owners . 
" Though it does not seem like animals can give you the virus , it appears you can give it to them . 
So if you ’re sick , avoid direct contact with your pets . 
If possible , have someone else care for them until you ’re well again , " the FDA says in the video . 
" Consider avoiding dog parks and other crowded public places , " it advises . 
And the six foot rule applies to leashed pets , as well as to other people . 
Housecats , as well as big cats in zoos , have been found to be infected with coronavirus , as well as farmed minks in the Netherlands . 
" A small number of pet cats and dogs have been reported to be infected with the virus in several countries , including the United States . 
Most of these pets became sick after contact with people with COVID 19 , " the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website .
