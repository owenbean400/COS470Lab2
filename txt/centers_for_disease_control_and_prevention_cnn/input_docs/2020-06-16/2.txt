About one in five people around the world could have an increased risk of getting severely ill from Covid 19 because they have an underlying health condition -- and this risk varies by age , a new study suggests . 
The study , published in the journal Lancet Global Health on Monday , estimates that 1.7 billion people , or 22 % of the world population , have at least one underlying condition that puts them at a higher risk of severe complications of Covid 19 . 
That ranges from less than 5 % of people younger than 20 and more than 66 % of those 70 and older . 
" However , for many of these individuals , their condition might not be diagnosed or known to the health system , or their increased risk could be quite modest , " the researchers , from institutions around the world including the United Kingdom , United States and China , wrote . 
The World Health Organization , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies have warned that older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions -- such as lung disease , serious heart conditions , or diabetes -- can be at a higher risk for severe Covid 19 . 
The new study included data from the United Nations on underlying health conditions among people living in 188 different countries . 
While the study used data from two large studies as sources , both studies could have underestimated the prevalence of some conditions .
