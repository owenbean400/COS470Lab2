" The most reassuring thing I can say to you , America , is that when they tell me that I can get the vaccine , I will get it , because I know that ’s the best way to protect myself and to protect my family and my community , " US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said on " Good Morning America " Monday . 
Adams said that he has been traveling around and talking to people , including presidents from historically black colleges and universities , trying to help people understand that Covid 19 vaccines were developed safely . 
When asked how to be sure there wo not be any future prolonged side effects from the vaccine , which is the first of its kind , Adams said that he speaks every day to Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ; and Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator . 
" Here ’s what they tell me . 
Normal studies only have about 5,000 people in them before a vaccine is approved . 
These studies have 30 to 60,000 , " he said . 
" These vaccines , at the point of being administered to the American public , will have more data than any other vaccine developed in history . " 
Adams reiterated he would get a vaccine as soon as he was able , saying , " Again , I will be in line to get it when they tell me that I can get it . 
That ’s how much confidence I have this will be safe – 95 % plus effectiveness . " 
Adams said he would hate for there to be a vaccine that could end the pandemic and that people do not trust it , saying he would continue to work with any organization out there " to help people understand the safety that went into this process , not just the speed . "
