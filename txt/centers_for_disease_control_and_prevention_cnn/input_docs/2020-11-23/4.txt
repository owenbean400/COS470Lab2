Passengers just broke a pandemic air travel record , in spite of the CDC ’s warning to not travel for Thanksgiving . 
TSA says 1,047,934 people passed through security at America ’s airports on Sunday — the second time since Friday that more than a million people flew . 
The previous pandemic record was set back on Oct.18 , the Sunday of the long Columbus Day weekend . 
Last week , TSA Administrator David Pekoske said that he expected travel levels to be on par with that record , noting that he expected the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after to be the busiest for air travel . 
In spite of the CDC urging people to not travel for Thanksgiving , airlines insist that flying is safe . 
On Friday , airline industry groups told reporters that the industry is not encouraging people to travel , but they are not discouraging them either .
