The United States health care system is quickly heading toward a " breaking point " as the country reported its highest one day death toll since the coronavirus pandemic began , CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said . 
Gupta said he fears hospitals and health workers will be overwhelmed and Americans will not be able to get the level of care they are used to . 
Gupta also said that the US is " tracking just as badly " as it was during the 1918 influenza pandemic . 
Gupta said that there were more alternatives as Covid 19 emerged in the spring , when patients were mainly concentrated in the Northeast — such as sending patients elsewhere or bringing in health care workers from less affected areas . 
An ensemble forecast released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects there will be 303,000 to 329,000 coronavirus deaths in the US by December 26 . 
" I do not know where this peaks at this point . 
I mean , this is starting to defy the models — even the aggressive ones — in terms of how bad things could get , " he said . 
He said " circuit breaker " lockdowns in hotspots would help ease the spread of the virus .
