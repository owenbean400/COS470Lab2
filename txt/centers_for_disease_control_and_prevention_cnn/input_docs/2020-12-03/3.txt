US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield has accepted the Covid 19 vaccine recommendations voted on this week by the agency ’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices . 
The CDC ’s vaccine advisers voted 13-1 on Tuesday to recommend that health care workers and residents of long term care facilities be first in line for any coronavirus vaccines that get emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration . 
" Dr . Redfield supports their recommendations and has signed the memo and accepted these interim recommendations , " the CDC said in a statement on Thursday . 
In the statement , Redfield thanked the advisory committee members for their work and suggested future Covid 19 vaccine recommendations prioritize older people living in multi generational households . 
" Dr . Redfield looks forward to future recommendations that , based on vaccine availability , demonstrate that we as a Nation also prioritize the elderly ( > 70 yo ) who reside in multi generation households , " the statement said . 
" Often our Hispanic , Black and Tribal Nations families care for their elderly in multigenerational households and they are also at significant risk . 
This framework , in addition to the ACIP guidance , will ensure a more equitable distribution to those most at risk for hospitalizations and fatalities . "
