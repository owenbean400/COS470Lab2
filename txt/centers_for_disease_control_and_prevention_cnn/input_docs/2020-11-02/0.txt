The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for isolation and quarantine do not preclude Americans from voting in the election , said a CDC spokesperson on Monday . 
In person voting can be carried out safely following CDC ’s recommendations for polling location and voters , the spokesperson said . 
When possible , alternative voting options – which minimize contact between voters and poll workers – should be made available for people with Covid 19 , those who have symptoms of Covid 19 , and those who have been exposed , the spokesperson added . 
Poll workers who are assisting voters with symptoms should be provided with personal protective equipment and trained to use it appropriately .
