Pregnant women with coronavirus are more likely to become severely ill and die from Covid 19 , according to a report released Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Although the risk of severe illness or death remain low overall , CDC researchers found that pregnant women with coronavirus are more likely to need the intensive care , ventilation and heart and lung support than non pregnant women with the virus . 
The CDC led team examined data on 461,825 women between the ages of 15 and 44 who tested positive for Covid 19 between January 22 and October 3 . 
They focused only on those who experienced coronavirus symptoms . 
The researchers adjusted for outside factors and found that pregnant women were more likely to need intensive care , with 10.5 per 1,000 pregnant women admitted to the ICU , compared to 3.9 per 1,000 non pregnant women . 
The researchers noted that among pregnant women , Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women had a more pronounced risk for ICU admission . 
Pregnant women were three times more likely to need help breathing with invasive ventilation than non pregnant women . 
Similarly , they were at greater risk of requiring lung and heart support with oxygenation . 
They were also more likely to die , with 1.5 deaths per 1,000 pregnant women , compared to 1.2 per 1,000 non pregnant women . 
Hispanic women , in particular , were 2.4 times more likely to die if they were pregnant . 
The team noted that regardless of pregnancy status , women over 35 were more likely to experience severe illness . 
The researchers say that the increased risk for severe illness among pregnant women might be due to physiological changes in pregnancy , including increased heart rate and decreased lung capacity .
