The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) made controversial changes to its testing guidelines after " updated recommendations " from the White House coronavirus task force , CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield said earlier today . 
The changed guidelines : The Trump administration has spent the day scrambling to explain the quiet changes made to the CDC website Monday . 
The previous guidelines recommended testing anyone who had been in close contact with a confirmed case , even people who do not develop symptoms . 
The new guidelines said only some people should get tested . 
Controversy over official approval : Earlier , Adm . Brett Giroir , who heads testing efforts for the task force , told reporters that task force members had weighed in on the change -- including Redfield and Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert . 
But Fauci later denied this to CNN â€™s Dr . Sanjay Gupta .
