Moderna 's experimental coronavirus vaccine appears to be safe and elicits an immune response in all age groups , including the elderly , a company official said Wednesday . 
Data from the phase 1 safety trial of the vaccine showed only mild adverse effects , and generated an immune response in volunteers aged 18 to 71 , Dr . Jacqueline Miller , therapeutic area head for infectious diseases at Moderna , told a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices . 
The phase 1 trial was conducted in three age groups : 18 to 55 , 56 to 70 and 71 plus years of age . 
Participants received two 100mg doses of the vaccine 28 days apart . 
Neutralizing antibodies -- which inactivate the virus -- were detected in all participants , including the upper age range , she told the meeting . 
All age groups also seemed to produce the same immune response -- a good sign , as older people often have weaker responses to vaccines . 
The most common adverse reactions were fatigue , chills , headache and myalgia . 
More reports of adverse symptoms were observed after the second dose of the vaccine , but the majority of symptoms resolved within two days .
