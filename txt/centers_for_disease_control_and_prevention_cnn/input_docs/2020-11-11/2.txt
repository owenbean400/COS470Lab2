Even with a vaccine in sight , we 're still going to be dealing with Covid 19 through most or all of 2021 and " quite possibly beyond that , " the former director of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention told CNN Wednesday . 
Dr . Tom Frieden , now CEO of Resolve to Save Lives , said that older people and those with underlying health conditions will continue to be at higher risk for severe illness or death from Covid 19 , even if a highly effective vaccine comes available soon . 
However , Frieden said the pandemic plan from President elect Joe Biden 's team is encouraging . 
" The President elect is clear about three things that we 've been lacking so far in this response , " said Frieden . 
" First , base it in science , second , communicate clearly openly , honestly , and third , make sure that we have an approach that is organized , so that it 's clear who 's in charge , what the role of different parts of government is and how we can minimize deaths while also minimizing harm to education to our societal and economic progress .
