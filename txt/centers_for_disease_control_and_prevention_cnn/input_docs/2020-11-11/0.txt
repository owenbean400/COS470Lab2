Wearing a mask can help protect you -- not just those around you -- from coronavirus transmission , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said in new guidance Tuesday . 
Previous guidance from the CDC suggested the main benefit of mask wearing was to help prevent infected people from spreading the virus to others . 
Cloth masks act as " source control " to block virus particles exhaled by the wearer and provide " filtration for personal protection " by blocking incoming infectious droplets from others , the CDC said in its new guidance . 
The new guidance cites a number of studies showing that masks reduce the risk of transmitting or catching the virus by more than 70 % in various instances .
