The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says thousands of passengers on board commercial flights may have been exposed to coronavirus since the start of 2020 . 
In a statement emailed to CNN , the CDC says it was made aware of 1,600 flights between January and August where a person on board may have had Covid 19 , potentially exposing 10,900 people " within a 6 foot range for droplet transmission " to coronavirus . 
" CDC identified and notified relevant health departments about these 10,900 on board close contacts , " said the statement . 
CDC said it has received reports of Covid 19 cases among people who were identified as contacts on flights , but noted this data is limited by incomplete contact information , delayed notification of an infectious traveler and incomplete information about testing and outcomes for contacts , among other factors . 
The new data , first reported by The Washington Post , comes as air carriers are ratcheting up their insistence that air travel is safe . 
Air travel in the United States remains at roughly 30 % of last year 's levels . 
In June , Vice President Mike Pence called for airlines to implement a contact tracing app , but no announcement has been made since .
