While nearly half of US states now report a rise in new Covid 19 cases , a leading public health official announced the majority of Americans remain susceptible to the virus . 
Speaking to the Senate Health Committee this week , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield said preliminary results on the first round of a study by the agency show more than 90 % of the population is susceptible . 
That means more than 295 million Americans could still get infected with the virus . 
About 6.9 million people across the country have already contracted the illness and more than 200,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The US continues to lead the world in both deaths and infections and now experts warn that the spread of the virus could get much worse with schools now open and flu season on its way . 
At least 22 states -- mostly across the US heartland and Midwest -- are reporting an increase in new Covid 19 cases compared to the previous week . 
Nationwide , the US is averaging more than 43,000 new cases per day -- about double what the country was averaging back in June when lockdown restrictions were easing . 
And the country is no longer seeing the kind of decline in deaths it was seeing in late August , according to infectious diseases expert Dr . Jeanne Marrazzo . 
Marrazzo said it 's not unfathomable another 100,000 Americans could die by the end of the year . 
Researchers with the University of Washington 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predict a total of more than 378,000 Americans will have died from Covid 19 by January 1 .
