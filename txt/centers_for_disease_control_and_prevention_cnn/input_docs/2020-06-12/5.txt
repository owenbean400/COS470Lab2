Most Americans are following advice to stay home and support other measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus , a new survey from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds – or at least , they did last month . 
Close to 80 % of Americans surveyed nationwide said they had self isolated and 85 % of New Yorkers said they had , the survey found . 
Nationwide , 74 % of those surveyed said they wore face coverings in public either always or often and those in the hard hit cities of New York and Los Angeles said they did so about 90 % of the time . 
" As well , 74.3 % of respondents in the United States reported they would not feel safe if these restrictions were lifted nationwide at the time the survey was conducted , compared with 81.5 % in NYC and 73.4 % in Los Angeles . " 
The team used survey data from Qualtrics LLC , given online . 
Surveyors contacted 4,000 adults and invited them to complete the questionnaire , so it was not completely self selected – something that can skew survey results . 
In the end , 2,200 responses were included in the survey , taken in May . Across the US , 17 % of those surveyed said they knew someone who had tested positive for coronavirus but that rose to 42 % in New York . 
Nationally , 6 % of people said they knew someone who had died of coronavirus and this went up to 23 % in New York . 
" Most adults reported they would not feel safe if government ordered community mitigation strategies such as stay at home orders and nonessential business closures were lifted nationwide at the time the survey was conducted , although a minority of these adults who did not feel safe wanted these restrictions lifted despite the risks , " the team concluded .
