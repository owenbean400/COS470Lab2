He continued : " In addition , we must look ahead to the fall and winter . 
While what will happen is uncertain , we have to pull all our efforts towards gearing up for additional potential challenges that we see every fall and winter — and that is influenza , " Butler said . 
" If anything , we must be overprepared for what we might face later this year . 
Getting the flu vaccine will be more important than ever , as flu and Covid 19 could be circulating together as we move into the fall in the winter months . "
