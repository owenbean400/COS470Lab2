Public transportation and travel can still be risky and people need to think twice before they leave home , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in new guidelines released Friday . 
The public transportation guidelines , posted last month , remind people to wash their hands before and after using trains , buses , subways and other shared transport . 
" During travel , try to keep at least 6 feet ( 2 meters ) from people who are not in your household â€” for example , when you are waiting at a bus station or selecting seats on a train , " they add . 
" Wear a cloth face covering when physical distancing is difficult . " 
The new guidelines also remind people about existing advice on travel . 
" COVID 19 cases and deaths have been reported in all 50 states , and the situation is constantly changing . 
Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID 19 , staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick , " the CDC stresses .
