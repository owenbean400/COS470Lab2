White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow sought to calm markets after stocks tumbled Thursday on news of a projected second wave of coronavirus , claiming there " is no second wave . " 
After fears about a rise in coronavirus cases , US stocks posted their sharpest selloff in three months . 
US stocks surged at Friday 's opening bell . 
But Kudlow appears to contradict himself almost immediately by saying some places are up — although he is quick to say the Trump Administration has it handled . 
Kudlow continued , " What you do have is certain spots are seeing a little bit of a jump up . 
Some small metropolitan areas are seeing it . 
CDC and the health people are all over it – they sent some task forces out to deal with that . 
You know , nowadays , we have better equipment , much more experience , much better testing . 
I mean the testing itself has jumped up , so you ’re going to get a little more positivity from that . 
But if you look nationally , the important point is the rate of increase of new cases is between 0 and 1 percent . 
It ’s really flattened out , and with respect to fatalities , it ’s the same , it ’s actually lower than that , it ’s like zero to a half a percent . " 
What we know about the virus : While new case rates are not growing significantly for now , 19 states are experiencing rising cases as of Friday . 
In many states , hospitalizations are also increasing , an indicator of people seriously ill with Covid 19 . 
Kudlow also suggested Dr . Deborah Birx – who has been largely silent and away from cameras – may be seen Friday , but it ’s unclear how or when . 
" If I can calm fears , again I ’m not the health expert , Amb . 
Birx may be out and about later today . 
Nonetheless , there is no emergency , there is no second wave . 
I do not know where that got started on Wall Street , " he said .
