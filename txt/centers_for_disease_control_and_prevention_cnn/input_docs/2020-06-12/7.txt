Stay apart from others , wear a face covering , and try not to share objects – that ’s the latest , updated advice from the US Centers for Disease control and Prevention for living daily life during the coronavirus pandemic . 
The CDC released its latest versions of guidelines for people Friday with a reminder that the virus is still spreading . 
" We know the pandemic is not over , " Dr . Jay Butler , CDC ’s deputy director of infectious diseases and Covid 19 response incident manager , told a media briefing . 
The guidelines use everyday language and straightforward advice : " In general , the more closely you interact with others and the longer that interaction , the higher the risk of COVID 19 spread , " they read . 
" So , think about : How many people will you interact with ? 
Interacting with more people raises your risk , " they add . 
" Being in a group with people who are not social distancing or wearing cloth face coverings increases your risk . 
Engaging with new people ( e.g . , those who do not live with you ) also raises your risk , " they add . 
" Some people have the virus and do not have any symptoms , and it is not yet known how often people without symptoms can transmit the virus to others . " 
The CDC advises keeping six feet apart from others when possible . 
" The closer you are to other people who may be infected , the greater your risk of getting sick , " the CDC said . 
The agency also advocates for face coverings , especially if it will be difficult to keep six feet apart from another person . 
" It ’s important that you and the people around you wear a cloth face covering when in public and particularly when it ’s difficult to stay 6 feet away from others consistently , " the CDC said . 
" Choose outdoor activities and places where it ’s easy to stay 6 feet apart , like parks and open air facilities . " 
Physical barriers such as plexiglass screens can also reduce the risk of spreading virus , the CDC said .
