The coronavirus pandemic , directly or indirectly , may have killed far more people in New York City than the official Covid 19 death toll shows , according to a report released Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The report looked at excess mortality in the city and found that 24,172 more people died since mid March compared to what would normally be expected . 
Indirect deaths : About 19,000 of these were either confirmed or probable coronavirus deaths . 
But more than 5,000 of the city ’s excess deaths had no explicit connection to Covid 19 , said the team , led by Donald Olson of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . 
It ’s difficult to know why exactly those deaths occurred . 
But Olson ’s team noted that people with underlying conditions , such as heart disease and diabetes , are more likely to die from coronavirus infections and such deaths may not have been directly attributed to Covid 19 . 
Nationwide problem : The findings add to a growing body of evidence showing how the coronavirus pandemic may be killing people without ever infecting them . 
For example , experts have said that a decline in reported heart attacks and strokes in the US is likely the result of people avoiding emergency rooms . 
" Tracking excess mortality is important to understanding the contribution to the death rate from both COVID 19 disease and the lack of availability of care for non COVID conditions , " the researchers wrote in their report .
