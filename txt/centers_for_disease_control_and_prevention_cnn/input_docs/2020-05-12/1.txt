Airport screening in California for travelers coming from China and Iran failed to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the state , according to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Health officials checked 11,574 travelers , sent their information to local officials , and had them monitored for 14 days -- but only three of these travelers eventually tested positive . 
There were a few factors impacting the program 's effectiveness ; states would receive incomplete traveler information , and public health officials spent substantial time correcting errors , the report said . 
It 's possible the team missed some cases , too , since people needed to have sought care and been tested to show up as a confirmed case . 
But if improved and sufficiently staffed , traveler monitoring programs could be useful for containing the virus once community transmission decreases in the US , the researchers said .
