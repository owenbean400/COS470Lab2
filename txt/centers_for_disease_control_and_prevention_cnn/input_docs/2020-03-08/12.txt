Yet when Tapper asked how many people have been tested , Adams said , " The numbers are tough because they 're changing minute by minute . " 
Tapper responded , " Just the rough numbers ? " 
Adams later said , " I would refer you to the CDC for that because , again , the numbers change so rapidly . "
