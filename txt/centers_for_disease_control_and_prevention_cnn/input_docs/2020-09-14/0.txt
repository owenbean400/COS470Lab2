Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said there is " quite a good chance " the team testing his company ’s vaccine candidate for Covid 19 will know whether it works by the end of October . 
When asked whether people would have to wait until 2021 to receive the vaccine , Bourla said that he did not know how long it would take for regulators to approve the drug . 
" We have a good chance that we will know if the product works by the end of October . 
Then , of course , it is ( the ) regulator ’s job to issue ( a ) license or not , " he said . 
Pfizer has started manufacturing the vaccine and Bourla said hundreds of thousands of doses have already been made . 
More details : Bourla said vaccine distribution will be a problem . 
Shipping medicines is complex , particularly when they need special storage conditions . 
But he said Pfizer already knows how to do it very well . 
As for who gets the vaccine , Bourla said that is something the authorities should decide , for example , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
