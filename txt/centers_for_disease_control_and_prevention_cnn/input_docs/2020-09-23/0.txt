A unnamed person 's attempt to manipulate information coming out of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for political reasons " has been unfortunate , " White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr . Anthony Fauci said Tuesday . 
" The person who was trying to influence the CDC , and even me , with emails is gone , " Fauci said at the Atlantic Festival . 
" So , I think we can put that behind us right now . " 
Fauci appeared to be referring to Michael Caputo , who served as the assistant for public affairs in the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
Caputo , who announced last week that he was taking a leave of absence , has been accused by critics of politicizing the CDC and HHS response to the pandemic , and of trying to influence studies published in the CDC 's journal , the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , to align with the Trump administration â€™s position . 
When asked where Americans should go for trustworthy information on the coronavirus , Fauci replied : " I would trust the CDC , and I would trust the FDA . "
