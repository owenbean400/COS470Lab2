Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease , said on Thursday during a House Oversight Committee hearing that the United States is currently failing when it comes to reducing the difficulty some Americans are facing when it comes to getting tested for novel coronavirus . 
After Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , was asked why people who wanted tests were not getting them , Fauci spoke up and said this : " The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it , we ’re not set up for that . 
Do I think we should be ? 
Yes . 
But we ’re not , " Fauci added .
