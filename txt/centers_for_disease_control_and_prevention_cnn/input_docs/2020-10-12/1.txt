Twitter just added a warning label to a tweet from President Donald Trump that claimed , without evidence , he is immune to coronavirus after his physician cleared him to resume public activities . 
He also claimed immunity in an interview on Fox News where he said he believes he will be immune for " maybe a long time , maybe a short time , could be a lifetime . " 
There is no evidence that people are immune to coronavirus if they have been infected once , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The CDC specifically cautions people not to assume they are immune . 
Twitter 's warning label says the tweet " violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid 19 . " 
Trump posted the same message on his Facebook account , but the platform has not added a warning label despite the fact that it violates its rules . 
The post has been up for four hours and shared more than 24,000 times on Facebook . 
CNN Business has reached out to Facebook for comment .
