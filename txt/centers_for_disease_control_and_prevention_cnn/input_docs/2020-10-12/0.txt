President Donald Trump 's doctor on Saturday said Trump has met criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to leave isolation after falling sick with the coronavirus . 
The White House did not say Trump had actually tested negative for the virus -- but according to CDC guidelines , people do not generally need a negative test to be around people again . 
Here 's why : People can test positive even if no longer infectious : Earlier in the pandemic , health officials said people should have two negative tests for coronavirus -- taken 24 hours apart -- before being around people again . 
That forced some people into isolation for weeks on end . 
But coronavirus tests ca not necessarily determine whether someone is infectious . 
PCR tests , for example , just look for pieces of genetic material called RNA -- and that can linger long after someone has recovered . 
According to the CDC , research has shown that people are not likely to be infectious 10 to 20 days after symptoms first began , regardless of test results . 
Why might Trump not need to isolate for 20 days ? 
People with mild to moderate Covid 19 are thought to remain infectious " no longer than 10 days after symptom onset , " according to the CDC , although people with severely weakened immune systems may need to isolate for longer . 
Before leaving isolation , people 's symptoms should have improved and they should have gone 24 hours with no fever , the CDC says ( still being on fever reducing medication does not count ) . 
For patients with severe Covid 19 , the CDC says up to 20 days of isolation " may be warranted . " 
But the agency 's recommendations only require 10 days . 
" Consider consultation with infection control experts , " the CDC 's recommendations say .
