New Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that seem to advocate for less coronavirus testing are probably the wrong move , an infectious diseases expert said Wednesday . 
Testing is a cornerstone of controlling outbreaks of any infectious disease , Dr . Rochelle Walensky , chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at Massachusetts General Hospital , said on CNN Newsroom . 
" I want to say where the CDC guidance really falls short is that they speak about antibody testing , speak about diagnostic testing and still seven months in , we do not have any guidance on surveillance testing , " Walensky added . 
" When we have so much asymptomatic disease out there propagating new infections , we need to do surveillance testing . " 
Some more context : The CDC revisions suggest most people who do not have symptoms do not need to be tested , even after exposure to someone with the virus . 
What is important , Walensky said , is the timing of testing . 
" I think that the CDC guidelines , I question them , and would say that after exposure you do need a test , " Walensky said . 
" I do advocate for calling your physician , calling a public health authority , to say when is the best time for me to get the test after I 've been exposed . "
