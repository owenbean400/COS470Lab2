The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its Covid 19 testing guidelines and now no longer recommends testing for most people without symptoms , even if they 've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus . 
Previously , the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure , even if they were asymptomatic . 
Here 's what the CDC website said previously : " Testing is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS Co V 2 infection . 
Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre symptomatic transmission , it is important that contacts of individuals with SARS Co V 2 infection be quickly identified and tested . " 
Those who do not have Covid 19 symptoms and have not been in close contact with someone with a known infection do not need a test , the updated guidelines say . 
" Not everyone needs to be tested , " the agency 's website says . 
" If you do get tested , you should self quarantine/isolate at home pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional . " 
The CDC guidelines still say people should get tested if they have symptoms and that someone 's health care provider " may advise a COVID 19 test . " 
" It is important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms , " the updated CDC site says , noting that local public health officials might request asymptomatic " healthy people " be tested , depending on cases and spread in an area .
