Dr . Carlos del Rio , an infectious disease specialist and the associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine , said on CNN Newsroom this morning that he does not understand why the CDC changed its guidelines on testing . 
The CDC changed its Covid 19 testing guidelines to say some people without symptoms may not need to be tested , even if they 've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus . 
Previously , the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure , even if they were asymptomatic . 
Del Rio said the CDC has not provided evidence to explain the changes . 
" I mean , the evidence that I 'm aware of as of today is that close to 40 % of the cases of the infections are asymptomatic and asymptomatic people transmit the infection , " Del Rio said . 
Del Rio added that he 's concerned about politics influencing these decisions . 
He noted that President Trump has said in the past that more testing leads to the detection of more cases . 
" If we slowed down testing we will have a decrease in cases , " Del Rio said . 
" So I am worried that this is just a way to slow down testing and that would clearly be not good . 
We do not want to decrease the amount of testing . 
We want to decrease cases by decreasing transmission , not by decreasing testing . "
