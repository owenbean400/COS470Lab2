Health care workers should be the first to get vaccinated against coronavirus if and when a vaccine becomes available , vaccine advisers suggested Wednesday . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) heard proposals Wednesday about which groups should be vaccinated first . 
The roughly 20 million essential health care workers are an obvious choice , Dr . Kathleen Dooling of the CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease at the CDC told the meeting . 
ACIP will eventually make recommendations about priorities for vaccinating people , and the independent National Academy of Medicine is also preparing a report . 
Non health care essential workers , with a population of around 60 to 80 million , should probably be vaccinated next , then adults with medical conditions who are at higher risk for severe Covid 19 , a population of more than 100 million , and finally the 53 million people aged 65 and older . 
The September ACIP meeting may vote on interim allocation of initial vaccine doses , Dooling said .
