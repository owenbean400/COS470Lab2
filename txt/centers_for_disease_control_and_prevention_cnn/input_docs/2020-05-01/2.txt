A federal judge ordered ICE ( Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) to release detainees from three South Florida detention centers , saying it is a " cruel and unusual punishment " and a violation of the detainees ’ rights to be kept in facilities that do not practice social distancing and do not provide them with masks or cleaning supplies . 
Immigration rights groups had filed a lawsuit on behalf of 34 detainees seeking release during the coronavirus pandemic . 
According to the court order , ICE has seven days to determine who can be released given their health and immigration status , along with their criminal history . 
The facilities concerned are the Krome Detention Center in Miami , the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach , and the Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven . 
According to the order , these are civil detainees , not criminals . 
She added that social distancing at Krome " is not only practically impossible , the conditions are becoming worse every day " and at Glades the bunk beds are 12 inches apart . 
The judge found that ICE had violated the guidelines set out by the US Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) . 
The judge ordered ICE to immediately comply with the CDC ’s and their own internal guidelines on providing adequate soap and water and cleaning materials to detainees . 
ICE will also have to provide a report to the court within three days outlining how it will reduce the population of detainees to 75 % of capacity at each of the detention centers within two weeks . 
ICE is also ordered to file weekly reports providing information about the number of detainees released and their health . 
CNN has reached out to ICE and Assistant U.S . Attorney Dexter Lee who is representing ICE in the case , according to the court docket . 
ICE had argued in the case that the court did not have jurisdiction over the everyday management of the detention facilities .
