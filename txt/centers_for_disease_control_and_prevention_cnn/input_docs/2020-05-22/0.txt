The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted new guidance on its website that estimates that about a third of coronavirus infections are asymptomatic . 
The agency also says its " best estimate " is that 0.4 % of people who show symptoms and have Covid 19 will die , and it estimates that 40 % of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick . 
In the guidance , intended for modelers and public health officials , the CDC outlines five potential scenarios . 
Four represent " the lower and upper bounds of disease severity and viral transmissibility . " 
The fifth is the CDC ’s " current best estimate about viral transmission and disease severity in the United States . " 
In that scenario , the agency describes its estimate that 0.4 % of people who feel sick with Covid 19 will die . 
For people age 65 and older , the CDC puts that number at 1.3 % . 
For people 49 and under , the agency says 0.05 % of symptomatic people will die . 
It assumes that people without symptoms are every bit as infectious as those with symptoms . 
The agency also estimates that 3.4 % of symptomatic people with Covid 19 will require hospitalization , with that number rising to 7.4 % in people 65 and older . 
In the most severe scenario , the CDC assumes that 1 % of people overall with Covid 19 and symptoms will die . 
In the least severe scenario , the CDC puts that number at 0.2 % . 
The agency also notes that its numbers could change as more is learned about Covid 19 , and says they do not " reflect the impact of any behavioral changes , social distancing , or other interventions . " 
That would be relevant for some of the agency ’s estimates , such as how many infections stem from each case . 
With those caveats , the CDC said the new numbers are based on real data received before April 29 . 
The CDC characterized them as preliminary estimates from federal agencies , including the CDC and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response .
