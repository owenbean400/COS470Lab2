While the US has historically led the way when it comes to things like smallpox , polio and HIV , other countries were off the mark faster with a coronavirus response , Microsoft founder Bill Gates said Thursday . 
A number of countries , which he did not name , got going a lot quicker than the US , said Gates , whose Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funds multiple health care initiatives . 
Countries with previous experience fighting SARS or MERS were the quickest and set up strong models , Gates said in a Time 100 talk . 
For instance , testing has been slow , Gates said . 
" The US is now starting , you know , to say hey , the testing turnaround ca not be long like this , " he said . 
" We need to be more prudent in not having things like bars and restaurants open , " he added . 
Gates also said that he doubted many people would be able to name an official at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which has been kept behind the scenes . 
But he was glad National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr . Anthony Fauci was speaking prominently .
