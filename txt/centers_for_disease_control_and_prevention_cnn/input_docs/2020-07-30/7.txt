Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis advocated Thursday for parents to be able to choose either in person or distance learning as districts in the state weigh their options for the upcoming school year . 
" I believe that there should be a choice for parents throughout Florida , " De Santis said at a news conference . 
De Santis cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as he said " kids under 18 are far less likely to be hospitalized or to die from Covid 19 than they are from seasonal influenza . " 
The CDC released guidelines last Thursday that pushed for schools to reopen and pointed to studies showing that children are not at high risk of severe symptoms from coronavirus , as well as to studies showing younger children may not be important vectors for the spread of the virus . 
" We cannot be the generation that deprives our children of the opportunity to live up to their God given potential , " De Santis said . 
However , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said last Friday that " there 's still a lot to learn about what the prevalence and incidence of infection is in children . "
