The Dallas Cowboys have announced season tickets will be unavailable for the 2020 season because of limited capacity at AT&T Stadium , dictated by NFL policies and CDC Covid 19 guidelines . 
In a statement released Thursday , the team announced Cowboys season ticket holders will have the first opportunity to purchase a limited number of single game tickets for a limited number of games . 
The single game tickets will not necessarily be in the same location as their current season tickets . 
Season ticket holders can decline the first opportunity to purchase single game tickets but if they opt out , they may not be successful in procuring seats because of expected limited inventory . 
According to the team â€™s statement , no matter which option they choose , Cowboys season ticket holders will retain tenure , seat location and associated benefits for the 2021 season and beyond .
