It 's been almost five months since Shelby Hedgecock tested positive for Covid 19 , and the former personal trainer said her symptoms are still debilitating . 
Hedgecock is among patients who call themselves " long haul survivors " -- those who experience symptoms long after testing positive . 
And long term effects like theirs need to be taken seriously , a doctor researching these symptoms told CNN on Monday night . 
Covid 19 can be a prolonged illness , even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in July . 
Some 35 % of patients surveyed by the agency said they still were not back to their usual good health even two to three weeks after testing positive for the disease . 
The rest said they 'd returned to their usual state of health five to 12 days after a positive test . 
Hedgecock first tested positive in April . 
And though she tested negative in May , she is still having neurological issues , cognitive issues , shortness of breath , chest pain , loss of smell and body aches and pains that send her to her bed for days if she participates in even gentle yoga , she told CNN .
