Coronavirus infections in the United States are much higher than the 7.6 million recorded so far by Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project , according to Dr . Tom Frieden , former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" Almost certainly there have actually been more than 40 million people infected by this virus in the US , " Frieden said Saturday during CNN â€™s town hall . 
" And that 's why there have been well over 200,000 deaths , " Frieden said . 
" The death rate is a fact and it 's a tragedy and we need not to get hardened to the reality that these are health care workers , these are mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters , and it 's going on every day . " 
Frieden also predicted that with the current surge in cases across the country , as many as 20,000 more people could die from the virus by the end of the month . 
Frieden said the most important thing anyone can do is to follow the science and the public health guidelines for mitigating the spread . 
" That 's why we all have to recognize that we 're in this together . 
There 's only one enemy , and that 's the virus , " he said .
