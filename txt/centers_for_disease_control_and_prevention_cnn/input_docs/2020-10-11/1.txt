An additional 20,000 Covid 19 deaths by the end of the month are " inevitable , " according to a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" From the infections that have already occurred , we will see something like 20,000 deaths by the end of the month -- additional deaths , " Dr . Tom Frieden said Saturday , during CNN â€™s Coronavirus : Facts and Fears town hall . 
" Anytime we ignore , minimize or underestimate this virus , we do so at our peril and the peril of people whose lives depend on us , " Frieden said . 
" If you look around the world , the parts of the world -- and even the parts of the US -- that have been guided by public health and have supported public health have done better , " he said . 
Fellow former CDC Director Dr . Richard Besser noted that projections are not set in stone . 
" What we do matters . 
And if we follow the lead of public health , if we follow the lead of CDC and do the things that are working around the globe , in terms of wearing masks and social distancing and washing hands and investigating cases -- ensuring people have what they need to isolate and quarantine -- that we can have a very different trajectory and we can get this in control , " Besser said . 
As of Saturday night , more than 214,000 Americans have died of Covid 19 , according to Johns Hopkins University .
