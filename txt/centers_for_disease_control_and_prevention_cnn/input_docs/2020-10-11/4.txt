President Donald Trump has been cleared to return to an active schedule , according to a new memo from his physician , Dr . Sean Conley , released Saturday night . 
The memo says Trump has met criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to end isolation but does not say whether the President has received a negative coronavirus test since first testing positive for the virus . 
However , that is not a criteria for clearing isolation , according to the CDC . 
Conley writes that Trump is 10 days from the onset of symptoms , has been fever free for " well over 24 hours " and after diagnostic tests , " there is no longer evidence of actively replicating virus . " 
Questions remain : Conley did not fully explain what " advanced diagnostic tests " the President received . 
For example , he did not disclose whether so called viral culture was performed . 
That ’s the process by which scientists try to infect living cells to see whether active virus is present . 
President 's schedule : Trump held his first public event Saturday since his diagnosis , delivering a speech to supporters at the White House . 
He is scheduled to hold at least three in person rallies this week , beginning Monday in Florida . 
Conley says he will continue to monitor Trump " as he returns to an active schedule . " 
Last negative test : It ’s important to note we still do not know when the President last tested negative before his positive test last week , which would offer insight into when he was contagious and how much so .
