The true number of coronavirus deaths in the United States is well over 250,000 , former CDC Director Dr . Tom Frieden said Saturday during CNN ’s town hall . 
Frieden , who served as CDC director under President Barack Obama , said a lot of the confusion about Covid 19 mortality rates is the result of the way fatalities are listed on death certificates . 
" If you die from cancer , and you also have diabetes , you still died from cancer , " Frieden explained . 
" If you died from Covid , and you also had diabetes , you died from Covid . " 
" Covid does affect older people much , much more than younger people , and many older people have lots of other health problems , so that ends up on the death certificate , " Frieden said . 
" The best way to look at this is actually a statistic called ‘ excess mortality ’ -- deaths above baseline -- and that 's actually quite a bit higher , " he said . 
" The true total of this , which includes Covid and Covid associated ( deaths ) , is well over a quarter of a million deaths in the US so far . " 
Frieden said there are typically three types of deaths that result from coronavirus . 
" People who died from Covid , and were diagnosed with it ; people who died from Covid , but were not diagnosed with it because there was not testing , it was not suspected , they died at home ; and people who 've died because of the disruption that Covid causes , " Frieden said .
