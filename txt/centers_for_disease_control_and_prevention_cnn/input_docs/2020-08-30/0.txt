Twitter took down a tweet containing a false claim about coronavirus death statistics Sunday afternoon that was made by a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory – a post that President Donald Trump had retweeted earlier Sunday . 
The tweet has been replaced with a message saying : " This Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules . " 
The claim from tweeter " Mel Q , " copied from someone else ’s Facebook post , was that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had " quietly " updated its numbers " to admit that only 6 % " of people listed coronavirus deaths " actually died from Covid , " since " the other 94 % had 2-3 other serious illnesses . " 
Trump shared the false information with his 85 million plus followers . 
As of 1:30 p.m . on Sunday , the now deleted " Mel Q " tweet Trump amplified had been retweeted more than 48,000 times . 
Its latest regular update to a public statistics page on the pandemic , the CDC said that for 6 % of the deaths included in its statistics , " Covid 19 was the only cause mentioned " on the deceased person ’s death certificate . 
That is not at all the same thing as saying only 6 % of reported Covid 19 deaths " actually died " from Covid 19 . 
It simply means that the other 94 % were listed as having at least one additional factor contributing to their death . 
For example , the other 94 % includes people whose death certificate listed both Covid 19 and obesity , both Covid 19 and diabetes , or both Covid 19 and heart disease -- among other conditions . 
People can live with obesity , diabetes or heart disease for years but then get infected with Covid 19 and die quickly . 
The fact that they also had an underlying condition does not mean that Covid 19 was not a major reason , or the major reason , they died when they did .
