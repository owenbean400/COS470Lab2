In the United States , about 41 % of adults had at least one underlying medical condition that may put them at a higher risk for severe Covid 19 outcomes , according to a new report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The research , published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report , looked at five conditions that tend to put people at greater risk for more severe disease from the coronavirus : chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , chronic kidney disease and obesity . 
It did not include other conditions , such as sickle cell disease or organ transplants . 
What the study found was that the numbers of adults with these conditions varied by county –– from almost 1 in 4 adults to as many as two thirds of adults in a county . 
In half of US counties , almost 1 in 2 adults were estimated to have an underlying condition . 
There were higher proportions of people with these health conditions living in rural areas , and in Appalachia and in the Southeast . 
The most common underlying condition was obesity , followed by diabetes , COPD , heart disease and chronic kidney disease . 
What this means : The CDC authors said the data on these conditions is limited at the county level . 
They hope the report can help public health leaders use the information to help them make decisions about what areas might need more health resources that may be overlooked otherwise . 
Rural areas , that already had been struggling with a lack of health care resources prior to the pandemic , for example , may need even more help . 
These areas may have smaller populations , but they have communities that have more people with underlying health conditions that may put them at greater risk of needing to be hospitalized for the disease .
