Assisted living facilities have been a hotspot for Covid 19 deaths in this pandemic . 
By Oct.15 , the proportion of Covid 19 cases that were fatal in these facilities was at least 21 % , a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found . 
It is likely higher , but only 39 states track these deaths . 
For perspective , for the general population , only 2.5 % of Covid 19 cases end in death , the CDC noted . 
The CDC has been tracking cases in skilled nursing facilities . 
Those institutions where residents need more care have a federal reporting requirement if they get a Covid 19 case . 
There is no such requirement for assisted living facilities , where the seniors live more independently , but get some assistance with bathing , housekeeping , and medication management . 
From this new CDC data published Thursday in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , researchers found 22 % of all assisted living facilities had one or more Covid 19 cases among the residents or staff . 
Residents are at a higher risk for Covid 19 because they live in close proximity with other community members . 
Their advanced age and underlying conditions put them at a higher risk for a more severe disease . 
To prevent the spread of Covid 19 in these facilities , the CDC recommends that each facility identify a point of contact at the local health department so they have a relationship if there is an outbreak . 
Managers should educate residents , staff , and residents â€™ families about Covid 19 . 
They should have a plan for when the facility needs to restrict access for families and staff . 
The facilities should encourage the use of masks and social distancing , as well as step up infection control and find ways to rapidly identify and respond to cases .
