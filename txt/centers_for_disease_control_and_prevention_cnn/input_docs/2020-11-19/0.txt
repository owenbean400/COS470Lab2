The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) on Wednesday urged nursing homes to " double down on infection control and adhere to testing requirements " during the holiday season . 
The agency said while residents have a right to leave their nursing homes to see family over the holidays , even a short trip can raise the risk of exposure to Covid 19 . 
It encouraged facilities to educate residents about the risks of leaving the facility , to go over steps they should take to reduce their Covid 19 risk and to encourage them to consider alternatives to family gatherings , like celebrating by phone or video . 
As of Nov . 1 , nearly 66,000 nursing home residents have died from Covid 19 , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
