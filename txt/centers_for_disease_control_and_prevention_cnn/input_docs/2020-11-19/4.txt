Despite coronavirus cases surging across the country , Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on the Trump administration 's policy of not supporting additional national lockdowns or the closure of schools . 
" President Trump wanted me to make it clear that our task force , this administration and our President , does not support another national lockdown . 
And we do not support closing schools , " Pence said Thursday , at the first White House coronavirus task force briefing since July . 
" And you ’ll hear from Dr . Robert Redfield of the CDC that , actually the CDC never recommended that we close schools at any point this year . " 
Pence ’s remarks come one day after the New York City public school system , the largest in the country , ended in person learning until further notice due to the coronavirus positivity rate in the city . 
Trump politicized the issue of lockdowns during his failed reelection campaign , repeatedly telling supporters that now President elect Joe Biden wants to institute another national shutdown . 
Biden did not say that however , and he reiterated at his own news conference on Thursday that he does not plan on instituting a national shutdown . 
" I 'll say again , no national shutdown . 
No national shutdown , because every region , every area , every community can be different , " Biden said , explaining that because the circumstances and infection rates are different throughout the country , custom rules and restrictions would be implemented .
