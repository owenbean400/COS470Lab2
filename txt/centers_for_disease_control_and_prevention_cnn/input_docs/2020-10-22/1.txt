Once a Covid 19 vaccine becomes available , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to monitor vaccine recipients for any health problems through text messages and online surveys , as part of a new program called V SAFE . 
" V SAFE is a new cell phone based active surveillance program for Covid 19 , " Dr . Tom Shimabukuro , deputy director of the CDC 's Immunization Safety Office , said during a US Food and Drug Administration open meeting on Thursday . 
Through V SAFE , which stands for " vaccine safety assessment for essential workers , " health checks can be conducted via text messages and email . 
This would happen daily in the first week after a person receives the vaccine , and then weekly thereafter for six weeks , according to the CDC 's website . 
If a vaccine recipient reports any adverse events , the program will help submit a report to the US Department of Health and Human Services ' Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS . 
" It includes active telephone follow up , " Shimabukuro said . 
It â€™s a more active way to monitor for adverse events , instead of merely waiting for patients to report them . 
Thursday 's open meeting was held to discuss the development , authorization and licensure of Covid 19 vaccines in the United States .
