The Russian military reported 2,090 cases of the coronavirus among its personnel , cadets and civilian employees , according to the country 's defense ministry . 
From March through April 26 , 874 servicemen have tested positive , the Defense Ministry said Sunday , adding that most of them were either isolated at home or in military hospitals . 
Another 971 cases were found among cadets in military academies and schools across the country , and 245 civilians employed by the defense ministry have tested positive . 
The majority of patients showed no symptoms , the statement added . 
Over the past weeks , reports had emerged in Russia â€™s independent media outlets about coronavirus outbreaks in military academies , including troops who took part in the Moscow rehearsals for the May 9 Victory Day parade . 
Last week , the head of the prestigious Kirov Military Medical Academy in Moscow was fired for failing to implement adequate coronavirus measures . 
The defense ministry did not disclose the exact number of cases at the academy , saying that cases were found in foreign students as well as 55 cases in students of other faculties . 
Several thousand servicemen have also been quarantined after they took part in dress rehearsals for the Victory Day parade in the Moscow region as late as April 6 . 
At the time , Russia had officially reported over 6,000 coronavirus cases and Moscow officials had already banned gatherings of more than 50 people . 
The massive parade marking the end of World War II in Europe , which usually has around 13,000 troops marching on the Red Square , has since been postponed by President Vladimir Putin . 
The defense ministry is still moving ahead with its annual spring draft , with 135,000 army conscripts expected to be called up in May .
