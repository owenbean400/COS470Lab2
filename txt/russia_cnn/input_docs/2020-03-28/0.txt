Russia will temporarily close its borders , with some exceptions , beginning March 30 , the Russian government announced . 
An order posted Saturday on the website of the Russian Cabinet of Ministers temporarily suspends traffic through automobile , railway , pedestrian and border crossings with the Russian Federation . 
The order takes effect at midnight Moscow time on Sunday . 
Russia previously closed entry to foreigners and halted most international flights . 
The order provides exceptions for Russian diplomats , Russian media representatives and other officials , as well as for transportation workers . 
The newest directive applies to checkpoints on the border between Russia and Belarus . 
The two countries have a relatively open border , but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been publicly dismissive of international efforts to contain coronavirus , while the Russian government has stepped up its response .
