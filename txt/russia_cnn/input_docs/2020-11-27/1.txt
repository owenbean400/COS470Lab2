More than 400,000 servicemen in Russia will be vaccinated against coronavirus , Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday according to state news agency TASS . 
More than 2,500 servicemen have been vaccinated so far , with vaccinations of 80,000 members of the armed forces scheduled for the year ’s end , TASS reported , citing Shoigu . 
" In accordance with the instructions of the president , vaccination of the personnel of the armed forces against the new coronavirus infection has begun . 
In total , it is planned to vaccinate more than 400,000 servicemen , " he said . 
Meanwhile , Russia ’s President Vladimir Putin has not been vaccinated against the coronavirus himself , months after he announced his country 's Sputnik V as the " world 's first " approved Covid 19 vaccine . 
Putin has said that his own daughter had gotten it . 
The Kremlin said Tuesday that Putin cannot get a vaccine that has not yet finished the final stage of trials , even though the jab has already been given to servicemen , some Russian frontline health care workers , teachers and several top level officials outside the clinical trials . 
" The president cannot use an uncertified vaccine , " Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a call with reporters . 
Peskov did not explain the difference between the vaccine being " certified " and " approved , " but said : " Mass vaccination has not started yet . 
And , of course , the head of state cannot take part in vaccination as a volunteer . 
It 's impossible . "
