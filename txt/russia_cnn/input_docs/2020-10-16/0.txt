Russia reported 15,150 new Covid 19 cases on Friday , almost a thousand more infections than the previous high reported on October 14 , according to the data from the country â€™s coronavirus response center . 
The total number of cases reported in Russia as of Friday is 1,369,313 . 
Russia has seen a surge in infections in the past two weeks , with its highest one day increase growing almost every day . 
Russian officials previously said the growing numbers could require additional action but added they believe they can avoid a repeat of the full lockdown that was imposed in the spring when the country was reporting on average around 10,000-11,000 new cases each day . 
Capital 's cases rise : Of the new infections reported Friday , about 5,000 were identified in Moscow , which is the most affected city . 
Late Thursday , city officials said that control over mask wearing on public transportation has been increased . 
All facilities remain open , including bars and night clubs . 
Vaccine race : Russia has registered two coronavirus vaccines for domestic use but they are so far not available for the general public . 
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said last week in an interview with state TV that residents need to " hold on for a couple of months " before the mass production of the vaccines begins . 
Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Thursday the " wider supply " of vaccines is envisioned for late November or December of this year , according to state run agency TASS .
