Russia has released no scientific data on its testing and CNN is unable to verify the vaccine 's claimed safety or effectiveness . 
Putin says one of his daughters has taken it : He said she had a slightly higher temperature after each dose , but that : " Now she feels well . " 
Some US experts say they would not take it : CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta said " of course " he would not take the vaccine , adding , " I know nothing about this vaccine . " 
And Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said " I would not take it , certainly not outside of a clinical trial right now . "
