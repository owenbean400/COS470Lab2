Twenty countries around the world have requested more than a billion doses of Russia 's newly approved coronavirus vaccine , according to the head of the Russia Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) . 
The vaccine has been named " Sputnik V " -- a reference to the surprise 1957 launch of the world 's first satellite by the Soviet Union . 
The Russian vaccine is yet to pass the crucial Phase 3 testing stage . 
Phase 3 trials , typically involving thousands of participants , assess a drug 's safety and effectiveness . 
Dmitriev said those trials would take place abroad . 
" We have already reached agreements on conducting the relevant trials of the Gamaleya vaccine with partners from the UAE , Saudi Arabia , and a number of other countries , " he said . 
The Gamaleya vaccine is the first in the world to be approved but there are widespread concerns that essential corners may have been cut in its development . 
Critics say the country 's push for a vaccine is partly due to political pressure from the Kremlin , which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force . 
On Tuesday , Dmitriev hit out at criticisms of the vaccine and the lack of testing and trials . 
" Coordinated and carefully orchestrated media attacks on the Russian vaccine have attempted to discredit and conceal the correctness of Russia ’s approach to the drug ’s development , " he said . 
Russia has released no scientific data on its testing , and CNN is unable to verify the vaccine 's claimed safety or effectiveness .
