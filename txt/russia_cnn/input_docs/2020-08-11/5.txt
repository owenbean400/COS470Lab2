US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar reacted to the announcement from Russia that it has approved a " world first " Covid 19 vaccine . 
Azar said that transparent data is needed , and that this data has to be from phase three trials that shows that a vaccine is safe and effective . 
" That ’s what President Trump is leading with the historic Operation Warp Speed initiative , with six vaccines in development , " Azar said . 
He said they believe they are on track to having tens of millions of doses of FDA gold standard vaccine by December , and hundreds of millions of doses going into 2021 . 
When asked how he stands by the timeline of December , Azar said that two of the six vaccines are in phase three clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy , and it will depend on the speed at which the clinical trials enroll , people are vaccinated and then exposed to the virus . 
" So , we believe , Dr . Fauci believes , that it is very credible that we will have – we have multiple that will be delivering results , and we could have FDA authorized or approved vaccines by December , " Azar said .
