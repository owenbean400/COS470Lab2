Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said on CNBC Tuesday that Russia is not ahead of the US when it comes to vaccine development . 
US vaccines are now in phase three trials , having cleared phase one and phase two studies , being tested on hundreds , or in some cases a couple of hundred patients , which is about where Russia is right now , according to Gottlieb . 
The amount of people who the Russian vaccine has been tested in means that it has cleared the equivalent of a phase one trial , but still needs to be evaluated in a large scale clinical trial , Gottlieb said . 
He said it was unclear to him what it meant for Russia to start giving some kind of preliminary approval to start vaccinating people outside of a clinical trial . 
Gottlieb added they might be trying to do a registry , where volunteers who take the vaccine outside of a trial who are then followed , but it ’s not really cleared for general use in the market . 
" There might be a little bit of semantics going on in terms of how they ’re treating this from a regulatory standpoint , " Gottlieb said . 
" So , they ’re claiming that it ’s fully approved , but it ’s not really fully approved . " 
However , they are not ahead of the US , he said . 
" They ’re certainly not ahead of us , and we certainly would not allow a vaccine to be used for mass distribution at this point based on the data that we have in hand . 
We just do not know that the vaccines are safe and effective at this point , " Gottlieb said .
