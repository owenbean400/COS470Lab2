Russian President Vladimir Putin extended the paid " non working " period in Russia until April 30 in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus . 
According to Putin , this time frame will be revised in case the epidemiological station in the country changes . 
" Of course the situation can unfold differently across the country as we have a very big country with varying population density . 
There are places where the coronavirus already poses a serious threat to its residents , like in Moscow , where , despite the regional and federal efforts , we so far have not succeeded in turning the tide , " Putin said . 
So far , the country has not proclaimed the state of emergency or called a nationwide quarantine , instead imposing " a paid holiday " week , which was due to end on Friday . 
However , the majority of regions independently have imposed self isolation regimes and ramped up measures to urge Russians to stay home .
