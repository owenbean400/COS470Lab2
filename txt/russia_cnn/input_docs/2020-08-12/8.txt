Russia raised eyebrows on Tuesday when it announced the world 's first approved coronavirus vaccine for public use . 
President Vladimir Putin says his own daughter has already received it , but testing is yet to be completed and experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine has been registered . 
Here 's a summary of what we know -- and do not know -- so far . 
Is the Russian vaccine safe and effective ? 
The short answer is that we do not know . 
Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify claims about its safety or effectiveness . 
But Russia says the vaccine has passed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials which were completed on August 1 . 
A Phase 3 trial on more than 2,000 people only began today . 
Typically Phase 3 trials are conducted on tens of thousands of people . 
How did Russia pull this off so quickly ? 
In April , Russia enacted a law which eliminated the need for a Phase 3 vaccine trial before approval . 
Approval now means the coronavirus vaccine can be distributed even as Phase 3 tests get underway -- though practically speaking , mass manufactured doses are not expected to be ready for weeks . 
" They 're not as far ahead as other vaccines , " Neal said , noting that Moderna and Oxford 's vaccines have already begun Phase 3 trials . 
Critics say Russia 's haste is partly due to political pressure from the Kremlin , which is keen to portray the country as a global scientific force .
