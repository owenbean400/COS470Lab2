US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday that coronavirus vaccine development is " not a race to be first , " responding to Russia 's approval of what it claims to be the " world 's first " Covid 19 vaccine . 
Azar noted that two of the six Covid 19 vaccines that the US government has invested in entered Phase 3 clinical trials weeks ago , while the Russian vaccine is now only beginning that step of the process . 
The data from the initial trials in Russia has also not been disclosed , he said . 
Comparing Operation Warp Speed , the US government â€™s Covid 19 vaccine effort , to the Apollo mission to land humans on the moon , Azar said this " once in a generation type initiative " should produce a safe Covid 19 vaccine by the end of the year . 
Under Operation Warp Speed , the US government has six vaccines under contract .
