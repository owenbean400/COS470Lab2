Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he has confidence in the Russian coronavirus vaccine and is willing to volunteer in trials . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday announced the approval of a coronavirus vaccine for use , claiming it as a " world first . " 
Several US health leaders and vaccine experts have expressed skepticism about whether the vaccine has been proven to be safe and effective . 
No data from human trials of the vaccine has been released , and it has not yet gone through large Phase 3 trials . 
" I believe that the vaccine that ( Russia has ) produced is really good for humanity , " Duterte said , " By December ... we will hopefully have a Covid free December . " 
Duterte went on to say that his country would get priority access to the vaccine because of its relationship with Russia .
