Kirill Dmitriev , head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) , which is funding the coronavirus vaccine research approved in Russia said Tuesday the rollout of the drug " will be very gradual . " 
" We 're not going to give it to 10 million people tomorrow , " Dmitriev told CNN 's Anderson Cooper and Dr . Sanjay Gupta . 
" It 's going to be a very gradual , careful rollout going forward . " 
Developed by the Moscow based Gamaleya Institute , the vaccine has been named Sputnik V , a reference to the surprise 1957 launch of the world 's first satellite by the Soviet Union . 
It has yet to go through crucial Phase 3 trials where it would be administered to thousands of people . 
The announcement of the Russian coronavirus vaccine has been met with worldwide skepticism . 
The World Health Organization said in a statement about the Russian vaccine that " accelerating vaccine research should be done following established processes through every step of development to ensure that any vaccines that eventually go into production are both safe and effective . " 
Cooper asked Dmitriev , " To those who are saying that this vaccine was rushed . 
You said it was proven . 
How has it been proven effective ? " 
Russia has released no scientific data on its testing and CNN is unable to verify the vaccine 's claimed safety or effectiveness .
