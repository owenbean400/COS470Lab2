Dr . Anthony Fauci , the US ' top infectious disease expert , said he seriously doubts Russia has proven its coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective after Moscow said it had approved a drug for use Tuesday . 
" I hope that the Russians have actually , definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective . 
I seriously doubt that they 've done that , " Fauci told Deborah Roberts of ABC News for a National Geographic event to broadcast Thursday . 
A portion of the interview was posted by National Geographic on Tuesday . 
Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said that having a vaccine and proving that a vaccine is safe and effective are two different things . 
Fauci said that if and when Americans hear announcements from countries like Russia or China about vaccine development , they have to remember that the United States has certain safety and efficacy standards in place . 
Makers of the Russian vaccine have not yet released any data from human trials . 
The US Food and Drug Administration has said that it will only approve a vaccine if it meets a 50 % efficacy requirement . 
In a statement emailed Tuesday , the World Health Organization said it is in touch with Russian scientists and authorities and looks forward to reviewing details of the trials . 
According to WHO , there are 28 vaccines in human trials around the world .
