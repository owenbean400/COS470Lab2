Dmitry Peskov , the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin , told state run news agency RIA Novosti that he has been hospitalized with coronavirus . 
Putin has largely been working from a residence in the Moscow region via videoconferencing , with only a few in person meetings . 
Later on Tuesday , Peskov told the TASS news agency that the last time he had seen the President in person was " over a month ago . " Three Russian ministers have previously tested positive for coronavirus , including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin , who is still in hospital , as well as Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova and Minister of Housing Vladimir Yakushev . 
Russia has struggled to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus and now has more confirmed cases -- 232,000 -- than anywhere in the world outside of the United States , according to Johns Hopkins University figures . 
While the country 's official death toll is relatively low , with more than 2,000 fatalities reported , some critics and experts say the figure is almost certainly underestimated . 
Moscow 's mortality rate surged by 18 % in April compared to the same month last year , as well as compared to the April average for the past decade , according to data released by the city â€™s civil register office . 
Peskov 's announcement came hours after a fire at a hospital in Russia left at least five coronavirus patients dead . 
The fire broke out on the sixth floor of an intensive care unit at the St . George Hospital in St . Petersburg , killing five patients connected to ventilating equipment , TASS reported , citing medical personnel . 
According to initial findings , the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in a ventilator or its malfunction , state news agencies said .
