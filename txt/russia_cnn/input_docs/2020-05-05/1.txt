Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said he is moving ahead with the military parade commemorating the end of World War Two in Europe on May 9 , according to a readout posted on his presidential website Sunday . 
Lukashenko told his cabinet not to " drag anyone " to the parade , which he said will be organized " properly , " but did not elaborate . 
" If people do not want ( to go ) , they are afraid , they are taking care of their health -- we will understand it , " the Belarusian president said . 
" Today there are enough people who want this event to be held , thousands and thousands of people . " 
Russia and other former Soviet countries have cancelled Victory Day events due to health risk concerns . 
The background : Belarus , a country of about 9.5 million people , has recorded 17,489 cases of coronavirus and more than 100 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University data . 
The country has not canceled public events or ordered people into self isolation , and Lukashenko publicly said he thinks the dangers of coronavirus are overblown .
