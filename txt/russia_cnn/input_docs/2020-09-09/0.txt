The third phase of clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine will begin today , Russia 's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Wednesday , according to the country 's state news agency TASS . 
Russia drew criticism in August when it announced the world 's first approved Covid 19 vaccine for public use -- before crucial Phase 3 trials were completed . 
Since Russia registered the vaccine on August 11 , these trials are also referred to as post registration clinical trials of Sputnik V .
