Russian President Vladimir Putin said that fake stories about coronavirus in Russia are being planted from abroad and there is nothing " critical " happening in the country . 
" Regarding these provocations , the FSB ( Federal Security Service ) reports that most of these planted news come from abroad and this unfortunately always follows us around , " Putin said during a meeting with the government . 
During the session , deputy prime minister Tatyana Golikova said that social media reports claiming the Russian government was covering up the real number of coronavirus cases in the country were not true . 
In late February , an explosive claim by the US State Department that thousands of Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter were spreading disinformation about the virus made the headlines . 
Social media companies , however , said they had not seen supporting evidence . 
Russia 's Foreign Ministry has denied the allegations of being behind the alleged coronavirus disinformation campaign .
