Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko is self isolating after one of his family members tested positive for the virus , his aide told state run news agency RIA Novosti . 
Several high ranking Russian officials previously either had coronavirus or had to isolate due to possible exposure to it . 
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin spent several weeks in a hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in late April .
