UK Swedish pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca has signed a memorandum of cooperation with Russian makers of Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine during a video conference chaired by President Vladimir Putin on Monday . 
Joint clinical trials to test the combination of AZD1222 , the vaccine developed by Astra Zeneca and Oxford University , and Sputnik V , developed by Russia 's Gamaleya Research institute , will be part of this cooperation . 
Russia 's Sputnik V is an adenovirus based vaccine , while Astra Zeneca 's AZD1222 is based on a chimpanzee viral vector . 
Russia registered Sputnik V in August ahead of key large scale phase III trials necessary to establish the vaccine 's efficacy and safety . 
While phase 3 trials are currently ongoing , the country is already moving towards mass vaccination . 
Kirill Dmitriev , head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund , which sponsored the development of Sputnik V , also announced that Belarus became the first foreign country to register the Russian vaccine . 
First doses of the vaccine will be distributed among Belarussians in January 2021 , the country 's health minister Dmitry Pinevich said , according to Russian state run news agency RIA Novosti .
