Far from hospitals and often lacking basic infrastructure , Brazil 's indigenous people are dying at an alarming rate from Covid 19 with little help in sight . 
The mortality rate is double that of the rest of Brazil 's population , according to advocacy group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( APIB ) which tracks the number of cases and deaths among the country 's 900,000 indigenous people . 
APIB has recorded more than 980 confirmed cases of coronavirus and at least 125 deaths , which suggests a mortality rate of 12.6 % -- compared to the national rate of 6.4 % . 
Indigenous people who have moved to larger towns or urban areas to study or in search of work can end up in precarious living conditions with few public services , increasing their vulnerability to health issues . 
Meanwhile , those living in remote areas may not have basic sanitation and health facilities -- a 15 year old Yanomami boy from a remote village in the Amazon , was one of the first indigenous Brazilians to die of Covid 19 in April . 
On Saturday , Brazil overtook Russia to have the second highest total number of confirmed cases in the world , after the US . 
The country has 347,398 cases .
