European stocks have plunged in the opening minutes of trade , as investors respond to falling oil prices and Coronavirus fears . 
The main markets have all fallen heavily , with the FTSE 100 down 8 % and the German Dax down 7 % . 
Ahead of the open , European futures fell 10 % . 
That â€™s the worst decline for Euro STOXX 50 futures on record -- more severe than the aftermath of September 11 , when European futures fell 9 % . 
It comes as oil prices crashed nearly 30 % after Saudi Arabia shocked the markets by launching a price war in crude against one time ally Russia . 
Fears over the impact of Coronavirus have also hurt investor confidence .
