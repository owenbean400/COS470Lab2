Frontline medical workers in the US , UK and elsewhere may face major risks in their efforts to battle the coronavirus pandemic , but they 've also seen an outpouring of public appreciation . 
In Russia , health workers say they face fear , mistrust -- even open hostility . 
Tatyana Revva , an intensive care specialist in the city of Kalach on Don in southern Russia , shared a video in late March about equipment shortages with the Doctors Alliance , an advocacy group aligned with Russia 's political opposition . 
After the video went viral , she said , she was summoned by local police . 
" I was called to the police and gave a statement with a lawyer , but another statement against me was sent to the prosecutor 's office , " Revva told CNN via Skype after finishing a night shift . 
Revva said law enforcement investigators subsequently checked the availability of PPE and ventilators at her hospital . 
" But the check was carried out a month after I flagged the problems , " she said . 
" You can imagine how much had been purchased in a month after the buzz the video made . " 
Revva says she has not been fined by police , but now fears professional retaliation . 
Police have not responded to CNN 's request for comment . 
The hospital administration could not immediately be reached for comment , but the hospital 's chief doctor , Oleg Kumeiko , said in a March 29 statement on You Tube that the information posted online about PPE shortages was " absolutely untrue . " 
Rumors and conspiracy theories abound in Russia about Covid 19 : that the virus was invented by doctors to control society ; that medical workers are hiding the true extent of the casualties from the public ; or that medical personnel are falsely attributing deaths to Covid 19 to receive more money from the government .
