More than 3,000 healthcare workers have died from the coronavirus globally and governments must be held responsible for their deaths , rights group Amnesty International said today . 
Russia , the United Kingdom and the United States topped the list of countries with the most healthcare worker deaths , the report " Global : Health workers silenced , exposed and attacked , " said . 
Out of 79 countries examined , Amnesty found that : In Russia , 545 healthcare workers had died from Covid 19 . 
The UK saw 540 deaths -- including 262 social workers . 
The US has 507 health worker deaths . 
" Countries yet to see the worst of the pandemic must not repeat the mistakes of governments whose failure to protect workers ’ rights has had devastating consequences , " said Sanhita Ambast , Amnesty International ’s Researcher and Advisor on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
Threatened for speaking out : The report said that healthcare and essential workers have faced retaliation from authorities after being threatened with arrest , violence , a lack of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and in some cases not being paid for their job . 
Two female Russian doctors are facing retaliation after complaining about a lack of PPE , with one being charged under Russia ’s fake news laws and being fined up to $ 1,443 , and the second facing disciplinary proceedings that could result in her dismissal , Amnesty found . 
Choosing " between death and jail " : An unidentified Egyptian doctor told Amnesty that doctors who speak out against their conditions were faced with threats to their life and interrogations by the National Security Agency and penalties . 
Amnesty said the 3,000 deaths is likely to be underestimated due to under reporting and differences in how countries count and collect data .
