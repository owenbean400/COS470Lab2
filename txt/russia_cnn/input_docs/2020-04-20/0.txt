The peak of Russia ’s coronavirus outbreak still lies ahead as more and more cases are reported in across the country , Russia President Vladimir Putin said in a videoconference with specialists on Monday . 
Putin initially said that early action had contained the spread of coronavirus . 
But the Russian government ’s official assessments have since been more pessimistic . 
Moscow and its region still account for the majority of coronavirus cases , but the country 's regions are lagging two to three weeks behind , Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said at the meeting . 
" According to experts — that is , you and your colleagues — the peak of the incidence rate is yet to come , " Putin said . 
" And now we need to do everything to smooth out this peak , to shorten the transit time through the so called plateau , when the largest number of new infections is recorded . "
