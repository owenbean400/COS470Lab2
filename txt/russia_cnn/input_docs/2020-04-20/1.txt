Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Vladikavkaz , the capital of North Ossetia republic in Russia , to protest against self isolation orders and job losses on Monday , state run TV channel Alania and Russian agencies reported . 
In videos emerging on social media , the protesters demanded the resignation of the head of the region and financial support from the authorities because of mass job losses amid the pandemic . 
Local lawmakers responded with a video urging people to stay home and form an initiative group to address the issue of job losses and financial strains of the lockdown , state run agency RIA Novosti reported . 
Police special units largely dispersed the demonstration , detaining three organizers , according to OVD Info , an NGO that monitors protests and police activity in Russia . 
Local media reported that the protest had been initiated by an opera singer who last week posted videos saying the coronavirus was a " made up disease " and the response measures are inadequate . 
Regional authorities initiated a criminal investigation for spreading fake news about the coronavirus in Vladikavkaz . 
" Calling on the population of the republic to disobey and violate the regime of self isolation , the suspect formed an opinion among citizens that there are no circumstances that constitute a threat to their life and health , " a statement from investigators read . 
" As it was established by the investigation , this information does not correspond to reality . "
