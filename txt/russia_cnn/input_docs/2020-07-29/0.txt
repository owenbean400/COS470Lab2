Russia claims that its own coronavirus vaccine is already undergoing the registration process , state run news agency RIA Novosti reported Wednesday . 
In a government meeting chaired by President Vladimir Putin , deputy prime minister of Russia Tatyana Golikova , who is overseeing the Russian coronavirus response , said the country plans to start producing two vaccines in September and October . 
Remember : Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and there are wide concerns that the human testing stage of the vaccine is incomplete . 
CNN is unable to verify the vaccine 's claimed safety or efficacy . 
Critics say Moscow 's push for a vaccine comes as political pressure rises from the Kremlin , which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force . 
Today , Golikova said the country has " two most promising vaccines . " 
" One of them developed jointly by the Health Ministry â€™s Gamaleya Institute and the 48th Research Institute of the Defense Ministry , " Golikova said . 
" This August we plan to register it on a condition meaning that after its registration there will be clinical trials on 1,600 people . 
The mass production of the vaccine is planned for September 2020 . " 
" Another vaccine developed by the Vektor center of Rospotrebandzor began joint clinical trials which are to wrap up in September and also in September it will undergo state registration to be produced starting October , " Golikova added .
