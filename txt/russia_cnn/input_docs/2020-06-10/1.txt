Moscow reported at least 5,260 coronavirus related deaths in May , the city ’s Department of Health said in a statement Wednesday . 
" In May , Moscow registered 15,713 deaths , which is 5,715 cases more than in May of last year ( 9,998 ) , " the department said , adding that the three year average of mortality is 9,914 . 
Covid 19 " as the main or concurrent cause of death " was recorded in 5,260 of those deaths , officials said . 
The city ’s health officials say they have included " even most debatable cases " in this statistic , adding that only in 2,757 cases coronavirus has been recorded as the main cause of death . 
The department estimated overall mortality from coronavirus to be 2 % of confirmed cases if only cases where Covid 19 was the main cause are counted , and 3.8 % if all Covid 19 cases are included , arguing that the number is still much lower than in other world capitals . 
Remember : Russia ’s official number of Covid 19 deaths has been relatively low compared to countries with similar numbers of overall infections , and observers have questioned official counting methods that permit ascribing deaths in patients who tested positive for coronavirus to other causes such as terminal illnesses and other underlying conditions . 
In late May , Moscow officials revised the Covid 19 death toll for April upward , raising the documented number of fatalities attributed to coronavirus to 1,561 from 636 for the month . 
CNN and other news outlets reported in mid May that the city had seen a mortality spike in April , adding an estimated 1,800 excess deaths in comparison with previous year averages .
