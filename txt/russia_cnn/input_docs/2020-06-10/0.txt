A factory in Siberia is recalling its flagship ventilator model from all Russian hospitals after two machines caught on fire in coronavirus hospitals a month ago , state run news agency RIA Novosti reported Wednesday . 
In early May , two ventilators caught on fire in St Petersburg and Moscow coronavirus wards , killing six people . 
Russian supervisory bodies suspended the use of the model , the Aventa M , a few days after the incidents . 
The company , KRET , has initiated an additional check of the ventilators and said it will return the machines to hospitals once they are fixed , according to RIA Novosti . 
The Aventa M is the flagship ventilator produced by KRET , which is part of a state owned defense and high tech producer Rostec . 
According to a government contract , KRET was supposed to supply 6,711 ventilators in total this year to Russia â€™s regional hospitals . 
In April , KRET said it had increased production capacity from 10 ventilators to 100 ventilators a day . 
Russia sent several Avena M models to the US in early April . 
Following the incidents in Russian hospitals , a spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency told CNN that the ventilators had never been deployed and were eventually returned .
