Russia is in favor of convening a virtual G20 Leaders ’ Summit on coronavirus next week , which would be " meaningful " for coordinating an international response to the pandemic , according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov . 
Earlier this week , the Saudi Arabia G20 press office put forward plans to convene the summit . 
Russia has had a relatively low number of reported coronavirus cases , with 199 confirmed , according to the country ’s coronavirus response headquarters . 
Peskov downplayed reports in local media about shortages of masks and other equipment , saying there was enough protective equipment " for those who work with patients ... serve the population ... take tests ... [ and ] for those who meet passengers of aircraft and other vehicles arriving from dangerous countries . " 
The Kremlin spokesperson added there was " no need " for Russian President Vladimir Putin to take a coronavirus test , as he was feeling healthy and has continued his work . 
" We are all in the same boat " when it comes to efforts by Russian and international scientists to work toward developing a vaccine , Peskov added .
