Russia has suspended the use and circulation of Aventa M ventilators produced after April 1 2020 , following two deadly fires in coronavirus hospitals , the country ’s Federal Service for Supervision in Healthcare Roszdravnadzor said in a statement Wednesday . 
On Tuesday , a fire in St . Petersburg claimed the lives of five patients and forced the evacuation of 150 people . 
Three days earlier a similar incident killed one patient in Moscow . 
Both hospitals used Aventa M ventilators , Roszdravnadzor said . 
Aventa M is a flagship ventilator produced by KRET , which is part of state owned defense producer Rostec . 
KRET has been designated by the Russian authorities as the main supplier of ventilators in the country . 
According to a government contract , KRET is supplying 6,711 ventilators in total this year to Russia ’s regional hospitals . 
In April , the company said it would increase its production capacity from 10 ventilators to 100 ventilators a day . 
Aventa M ventilators were also part of a shipment of medical supplies sent by Russia to the US in early April . 
A FEMA spokesperson told CNN the ventilators had never been deployed and the shipment was returned by New York and New Jersey .
