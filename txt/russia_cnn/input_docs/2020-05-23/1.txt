Russia reported 9,434 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday , as questions continue to be raised about the safety of frontline workers and the country 's official Covid 19 figures . 
Russia now officially has 335,882 cases of Covid 19 , making it the country with the second highest number of confirmed cases . 
It has recorded 3,388 deaths attributed to the virus . 
But there have been suggestions that even those numbers understate the true scale of the country 's outbreak . 
In an Instagram Live interview Sunday with a local journalist , the head of Dagestan 's ministry of health gave figures far higher than Moscow 's , saying the total number of people infected with coronavirus and community acquired pneumonia in the southern Russian republic exceeded 13,000 , with 657 dead . 
Asked by journalist Ruslan Kurbanov to explain why Covid 19 and pneumonia cases were being counted separately , the health official , Dzhamaludin Gadzhiibragimov , responded that pneumonia patients are treated as if they have the virus , but not all cases are ascribed to coronavirus due to a lack of testing . 
" Basically , the same [ treatment ] methodology is used for both , " he said . 
" But because we do not have lab test confirmation , the statistics are being compiled in that way . " 
Doctors in the region have complained in the past weeks on social media about the lack of protective equipment , and some hospitals have not had space to treat their staff . 
A video of nurses hooked up to intravenous drips in a storage room in the city of Derbent went viral in early May .
