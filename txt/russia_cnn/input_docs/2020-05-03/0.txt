At midnight on May 2 , Harbin City , on the Russia China border , closed all dine in restaurants until further notice , according to state broadcaster CCTV . 
The measures were to prevent crowds gathering in the city in China 's north east Heilongjiang province during the Labor Day holiday , according to the Heilongjiang government council . 
Heilongjiang has recently seen a spike in locally transmitted coronavirus cases , leading to more restrictive controls . 
Meanwhile , other Chinese provinces are beginning to lift lockdown measures . 
The local government council urged Harbin residents to remain at home during the holiday and asked everyone to follow the principle of " going out less , no assemblies and group gatherings , including meal gatherings . " 
The Heilongjiang government said : " This year 's Labour Day , we must put the health and safety of ourselves and our families as our top priority . "
