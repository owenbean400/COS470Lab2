Russia reported 10,633 new cases of the coronavirus in another record single day increase Sunday , bringing the total number to 134,687 . 
Around 50 % of the cases were asymptomatic , the country ’s coronavirus response headquarters said in a statement , adding that a total of 1,280 deaths had now been recorded . 
Russia has seen four consecutive days of record single day increases after a week of relatively steady growth , when it added five to six thousand cases per day . 
Moscow , the country ’s worst hit city , accounts for more than a half of total cases . 
In March , Vladimir Putin radiated confidence about his government 's response to a growing global crisis , reassuring his citizens that the situation was " under control " thanks to early intervention measures . 
The Russian President then played the role of international rescuer , dispatching a planeload of medical supplies to New York 's John F . Kennedy Airport . 
But by April 13 , the mood had changed . 
" We have a lot of problems , " Putin said in a video conference . 
" There is nothing to boast about , and we must not let our guard down , because in general , as you and your specialists say , we have not passed the peak of the epidemic yet . "
