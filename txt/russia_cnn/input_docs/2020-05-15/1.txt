China reported four new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours , according to the country 's National Health Commission . 
The new cases come from Jilin province in the northeast of the country , where a recent cluster of local infections has raised fears of a second wave and prompted fresh lockdown measures . 
Jilin borders both Russia and North Korea , and concerns have previously been raised over imported cases from overseas causing a renewed outbreak . 
There are also 11 new asymptomatic cases nationwide , which are counted separately from symptomatic cases , the NHC said today . 
Two of those were imported . 
That raises mainland China 's total to 82,933 infections since the start of the pandemic , and 4,633 related deaths . 
These totals do not reflect current active cases ; so far , 78,209 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital , according to the NHC .
