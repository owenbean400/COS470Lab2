There are still several virus hot spots around the world causing concern , said a top World Health Organization official on CNN ’s Global Town Hall earlier tonight . 
The WHO is keeping a close eye on very large increases in case numbers in Russia , Africa , the Americas , some countries in South Asia and a few countries in Europe , said Maria Van Kerkhove , technical lead for the WHO ’s coronavirus response . 
She said she hopes a vaccine could be deployable by the end of the year -- but that ’s if everything goes right . 
Scientists are working around the clock on more than 100 vaccine candidates , she said , but the accelerated schedule cannot compromise on safety or efficacy .
