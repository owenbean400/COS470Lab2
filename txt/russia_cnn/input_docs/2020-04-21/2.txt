Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said Russia had sufficient cash reserves to offset the collapse in oil prices , amid questions about the health of the country ’s economy . 
In a conference call with reporters , Peskov downplayed the impact of the crash , saying the collapse in May futures was " an absolutely speculative moment , purely a trading moment , " and that the market ’s shift into negative prices " should not be painted in apocalyptic colors . " 
Russia remains heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas exports , but has a reserve fund to cover shortfalls in the national budget . 
" The main thing here is that our government and our leadership have all the necessary reserves for damping the negative consequences of such international volatility in our economy , and of course , all the resources that are at hand will be used , " Peskov said . 
Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no immediate plans to discuss the situation with US President Donald Trump . 
The two leaders have spoken on the phone at least four times in recent weeks , according to a CNN tally .
