Pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca is launching a joint clinical trial with the makers of Russian Sputnik V to test the combination of coronavirus vaccines , according to a statement published on Astra Zeneca ’s Russian website on Friday . 
" Today we announce a clinical trial programme to assess safety and immunogenicity of combination of AZD1222 , developed by Astra Zeneca and Oxford University and Sputnik V , developed by Russian Gamaleya Research institute . 
It will begin enrolling adults aged 18 years and older , " Astra Zeneca said . 
According to the British Swedish drugmaker , a combination of the two coronavirus vaccines may help in generating " wider protection through a stronger immune response and better accessibility . " 
Both vaccines are adenoviral vector vaccines that contain " genetic material of SARS Co V 2 virus spike protein , " Astra Zeneca ’s statement added . 
The Moscow based Gamaleya Institute and Russian Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) - - which sponsored the development of Sputnik V -- said in a statement that they offered Astra Zeneca the use of " one of the two vectors of the Sputnik V vaccine in additional clinical trials of its own vaccine , " which is expected to commence before the end of this year . 
Russian vaccine Sputnik V uses human adenovirus , while Astra Zeneca ’s AZD1222 is based on chimpanzee viral vector . 
Russia registered Sputnik V in August ahead of key large scale phase III trials necessary to establish the vaccine ’s efficacy and safety . 
While phase III trials are currently ongoing , the country is already moving towards mass vaccination with the head of Gamaleya Institute saying that over 150,000 Russians have been inoculated so far , according to state run news agency RIA Novosti .
