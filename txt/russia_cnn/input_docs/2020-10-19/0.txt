Russia reported a record increase of 15,982 new Covid 19 cases on Monday , according to its coronavirus response center . 
The country 's total number of reported infections now stands at 1,415,316 . 
Russia has seen a surge in cases since the beginning of October , setting a new record for single day increases almost every day . 
Officials previously said the growing numbers could require additional action , but added they believe they can avoid a full lockdown of the kind that was imposed in the spring when the country was reporting on average around 10,000-11,000 cases each day . 
Moscow is Russia 's most affected city with over 5,000 cases . 
On Monday , Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reiterated in a blog post that city officials do not view another lockdown as a viable option . 
Sobyanin added that the city authorities were trying to strike " a middle ground " between a lockdown and no restrictions at all . 
So far they have issued orders to limit movements for some groups of people , including residents over 65 years old or those with chronic diseases ; asked employers to move a third of their staff to work from home ; and imposed distance learning for middle and high schoolers .
