Moscow will open mass Covid 19 vaccination centers on Saturday offering shots of Russia 's Sputnik V vaccine , according to the city 's mayor . 
" Moscow has set up a full technological and organizational chain for the vaccination [ process ] , " Sergey Sobyanin said in a blog post . 
" Specialized storage facilities have been selected , refrigerators and containers for vaccine delivery have been prepared . " 
Priority will go to the most at risk groups such as teachers , health professionals and city workers , who can sign up online from Friday . 
The centers will then be used to vaccinate other groups depending on the amount of supplied doses , Sobyanin said . 
The announcement comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his government to start large scale vaccinations against the coronavirus from next week . 
Russia registered its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine in August ahead of large scale Phase 3 trials which are currently underway . 
In November it said an early analysis of data from its the vaccine suggested it is 92 % effective . 
However , some scientists are urging caution , noting that the data is far from conclusive . 
Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Wednesday that to date more than 100,000 Russian citizens have had a Sputnik V shot , but did not specify who has been vaccinated .
