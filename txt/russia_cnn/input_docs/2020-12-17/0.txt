Russian President Vladimir Putin , who is 68 , said Thursday he still has not been vaccinated with a Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V as it 's not yet advised for people older than 60 . 
" The vaccines that are being circulated among the general population today are intended for people in a certain age group , and the vaccines have not yet reached people like me , " Putin said during his annual press conference . 
" I 'm a law abiding citizen in that matter , I listen to the recommendations of our specialists and so far have not taken it . 
But I will do it as soon as it becomes a possibility . " 
Russia registered Sputnik V in August ahead of key large scale Phase 3 trials necessary to establish the vaccine 's efficacy and safety , drawing skepticism both in Russia and internationally . 
According to the product description , the vaccine is recommended to people aged 18-60 and is not advised to people with a number of chronic diseases and health conditions . 
" I think it 's necessary to [ have mass vaccination ] , specialists across the world say that mass vaccination is one of the very few ways to overcome this pandemic , it should create population immunity , " Putin said . 
" And I repeat that our vaccine is effective and safe so I see no reason not to vaccinate . " 
Sputnik V 's Phase 3 trials are currently ongoing , but the country is already moving towards mass vaccination with the Russian Direct Investment Fund , which sponsored the vaccine 's development , saying that over 200,000 Russians have been inoculated as of December 14 . 
During the press conference , Putin also touched upon production challenges that Russia is facing , saying the country so far does not have enough " hardware " to manufacture the necessary amount of the vaccine and is working to increase the number of capable production sites .
