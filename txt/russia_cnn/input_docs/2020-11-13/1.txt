South Korean biotechnology company GL Rapha will produce over 150 million doses of Russia 's Sputnik V Covid 19 vaccine per year , the Russian Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) said Friday . 
The doses are set to be distributed around the world , the RDIF said . 
Russia claims that Phase 3 clinical trials have shown the vaccine to be 92 % effective against Covid 19 , " based on 20 confirmed Covid 19 cases split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo . " 
The Phase 3 trial is yet to be completed and will continue for six more months . 
Scientists have reacted to the early Phase 3 data with caution , especially as Russia 's claims are based on just 20 cases . 
Moscow drew criticism from scientific circles when it announced the world 's first approved coronavirus vaccine for public use in August -- even before the crucial Phase 3 trials had been completed .
