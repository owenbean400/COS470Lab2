Russia reported a new record of daily coronavirus infections Friday , confirming 24,318 new cases , according to data from the country 's coronavirus response center . 
The data shows that Moscow is the worst affected city , with 6,902 cases , which is also a new record . 
The center also reported the overall death toll to be 35,311 . 
A CNN investigation earlier this week , however , revealed that official Russian coronavirus death figures may be grossly understating the real toll by excluding people whose cause of death is attributable to other conditions . 
Most countries count a death from other conditions , such as pneumonia , as a Covid 19 death if the coronavirus infection triggered the person 's deteriorating health . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted on Wednesday that the coronavirus situation in the country remains " challenging but controllable " and urged regional governors not to " conceal " the real scale of the problem .
