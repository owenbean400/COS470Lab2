Russian President Vladimir Putin said the coronavirus outbreak in Russia is worsening , warning Monday that the number of seriously ill patients is on the rise . 
" We are seeing that the situation is changing every single day and regrettably not for the better . 
The number of sick people is increasing along with the number of serious cases , " Putin told officials during a televised conference on Monday . 
Speaking to Russia â€™s Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova , Healthcare Minister Mikhail Murashko and Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin , Putin highlighted that the viral outbreak in other parts of Russia is projected to be behind Moscow by approximately three to four weeks . 
He called on local officials not to waste time . 
" This means that they still have time . 
But this time can disappear very quickly ; it must not be wasted but used in the most effective way possible , " Putin urged . 
" The next few weeks will largely determine the situation , and this is why all our actions , including preventive measures on site and the organization of the entire healthcare system should be most rational and taken on the safe side with due account of all factors , " he continued . 
According to the John Hopkins University , at least 18,328 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Russia , while at least 148 deaths have so far been recorded .
