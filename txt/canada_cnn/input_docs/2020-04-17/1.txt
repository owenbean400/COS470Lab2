Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government and the Trump administration are " aligned " and that the US Canada border will remain closed to all but essential travel for weeks to come . 
Some context : President Trump indicated earlier this week that the border may reopen soon , along with other parts of the American economy . 
" Our relationship with Canada is very good — we ’ll talk about that . 
It will be one of the early borders to be released , " Trump said . 
" Canada ’s doing well , we ’re doing well — so we ’ll see , " he said during a press briefing Wednesday . 
The two countries negotiated a mutual ban on non essential travel in late March . 
Since then , border traffic has decreased dramatically except for commercial goods and essential workers . 
As the President has discussed the reopening of the US economy , anxiety has been building in Canadian border towns that have not been as severely affected by Covid 19 as their cross border neighbors . 
" Trudeau should say no right away , " Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Thursday . 
" Until we have this under containment , we need to have our borders closed . "
