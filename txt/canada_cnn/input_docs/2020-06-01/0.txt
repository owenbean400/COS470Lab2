Eli Lilly and Company said it has started the first human trial of an antibody therapy to treat the novel coronavirus . 
If the trial is successful , the therapy could be available by the fall , the company said . 
The first patients to receive the therapy are in hospitals at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles , New York University â€™s Grossman School of Medicine and Emory University in Atlanta , the company told CNN , and results are expected to be available by the end of June . 
The antibody therapy was created through a partnership with Ab Cellera , a Canada based biotech company and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Scientists at Ab Cellera and NIAID used a blood sample from one of the first US patients to recover from Covid 19 and sorted through millions of cells to find hundreds of antibodies . 
Antibodies are proteins your body makes to fight an infection or toxin . 
The scientists picked the antibodies they thought would best neutralize the novel coronavirus . 
In the lab , the antibody appeared to neutralize the virus , Lilly said . 
Those results have not yet been published . 
About the trial : Phase I of the trial in hospitalized patients will test to see if the therapy is safe and well tolerateed . 
If so , the next trials would be expanded to Covid 19 patients that are not hospitalized and another study would test the therapy as prevention . 
The antibody therapy could potentially be used in vulnerable populations that may not respond as well to a vaccine , such as the elderly , people with underlying chronic conditions and people who are immunosuppressed who do not always generate enough antibodies to be protected by a vaccine . 
In trials over the next few months , Lilly says it will also test different mixtures of a few other antibodies that may provide protection .
