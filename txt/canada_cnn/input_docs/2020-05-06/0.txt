The big lie of the Trump administration is that China is the cause of America 's problems . 
The meme has worked for a while , since it plays into American smugness that if China is succeeding , they must be cheating . 
Trump and his right wing allies upped this game recently by claiming the Covid 19 pandemic was the result of an accidental release from a Chinese laboratory and that China 's " cover up " blocked an effective global response . 
According to CNN , the still secret findings of the Five Eyes intelligence agencies ( the US , UK , Australia , New Zealand , and Canada ) pour cold water on this claim . 
So too does Trump 's top infectious disease expert , Dr . Anthony Fauci . 
Yet just this past Sunday , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asserted , " There is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan . " 
Such charges by the Trump administration and by Sen . 
Tom Cotton of Arkansas are reckless and dangerous . 
They could push the world to conflict just as the Bush administration 's lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq pushed the US into war in 2003 .
