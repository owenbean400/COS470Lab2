Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $ 1.75 billion CAD universal broadband fund to connect all Canadians to high speed internet , in light of changes to work and schooling during the pandemic . 
The fund will be used to build infrastructure across the country , almost entirely in rural and remote communities , Trudeau said at a news conference on Monday . 
Trudeau addressed the changed landscape of working and learning from home , pointing to the importance of high speed internet and the government 's role in providing reliable internet connections to Canadian citizens . 
The PM said that in the last five years , his government has invested to connect 1.2 million households to high speed internet . 
He said the previous government invested $ 700 million CAD in connecting people to the internet , and that his government has invested $ 6 billion CAD -- nearly 10 times as much -- over the past five years .
