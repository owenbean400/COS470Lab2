The Quebec government says it will not hesitate to shut down schools again if Quebecers do not show more caution in the coming weeks . 
Quebec Premier Francois Legault issued the warning Monday after health officials confirmed more than 100 staff and students are currently in quarantine or isolation as a precaution after possible exposure to Covid 19 in schools . 
" Above all , I do not want to close the schools , " said Legault , adding , " We owe this to our children . 
In order for our children to stay in school , we have to be careful . " 
Provincial officials in Quebec confirmed Monday that 81 students in Quebec City are in isolation after three cases of Covid 19 were confirmed at two high schools . 
And in the Laurentians region of Quebec 4 teachers have tested positive for Covid 19 , sending more than 30 staff and students into isolation for 2 weeks as a precaution . 
Most of Canada , including Quebec , has been experiencing a recent spike in cases . 
Earlier in the summer , Canada averaged about 350 new positive coronavirus cases per day , but that number has increased to an average of 435 over the last week , according to Canadian public health officials .
