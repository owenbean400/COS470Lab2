At least 2 million Canadians lost their jobs in April , adding to the 1 million who were already unemployed through March . 
Canada â€™s unemployment rate stands at 13 % , the second highest ever recorded . 
Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would be even higher , nearly 18 % , if those who were not actively looking for work were included in the unemployment rate . 
Nearly one in three Canadian workers either did not work in April or had reduced hours . 
Trudeau announced that the emergency wage subsidy program is being extended beyond June , in an effort to encourage more employers to keep staff on payroll or to help more businesses re hire employees already laid off . 
Canada said nearly 100,000 businesses have already been approved for the up to 75 % wage subsidy program and that 1.7 million workers are already keeping their jobs while on the program . 
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce called the job losses " staggering " and added that the key to reopening the economy will be " re skilling " businesses and employees . 
" The key question is how quickly businesses can or will re hire once the economy reopens , " said the Chamber in a statement noting that many businesses will have to reopen even as social distancing requirements remain in place .
