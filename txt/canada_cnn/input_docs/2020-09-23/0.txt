Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared Wednesday that a second wave of the coronavirus is already underway in most of Canada . 
" We ’re on the brink of a fall that could be much worse than the spring . 
I know this is not the news that any of us wanted to hear and we ca not change today ’s numbers or even tomorrow ’s . 
Those were already decided by what we did or did not do two weeks ago , " said Trudeau during a rare address to the nation . 
" It ’s all too likely we wo not be gathering for Thanksgiving , but we still have a shot at Christmas . 
Together we have the power to get this second wave under control , " Trudeau said telling Canadians they have the power to flatten the pandemic curve once again . 
Canada 's Thanksgiving holiday is Oct . 12 .
