Coca Cola is planning to cut 2,200 jobs , including 1,200 in the United States , as it faces declining sales during the pandemic . 
In the US , where there were about 10,400 employees at the end of last year , the cuts represent roughly 12 % of the workforce . 
In Atlanta , where the company is headquartered , about 500 jobs are being eliminated , the company said Thursday . 
The reductions include voluntary and involuntary separations , and the severance packages are expected to cost the company between $ 350 million and $ 550 million . 
The company announced plans to trim its workforce over the summer , when it said that it was offering buyouts to 4,000 workers in the United States , Canada and Puerto Rico . 
It also said then that it plans to reduce its number of operating units from 17 businesses in four regions to nine operating units in those areas . 
Coca Cola did not share on Thursday which specific units would be affected . 
In the third quarter , Coke 's net revenues declined 9 % to $ 8.7 billion , as the company struggled with lost sales from restaurants â€” many of which have closed their doors permanently . 
As it looks ahead , the company is focusing on its most popular segments , including its namesake line of beverages like Coke and Coke Zero . 
Coca Cola said in October that it was canceling 200 brands , or half of its portfolio . 
Earlier this year , it announced the discontinuation of notable , if unfashionable , brands Odwalla , Zico and Tab . About 86,2000 people worked for Coca Cola worldwide at the close of last year .
