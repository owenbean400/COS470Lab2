Canadian public health officials say they are concerned about a small but significant increase in cases of Covid 19 throughout the country , especially among younger people . 
The Public Health Agency of Canada now says more than 55 % of new infections over the past week have been in younger adults under the age of 39 . 
Earlier in the pandemic that group represented about a third of all infections . 
" There are lots of factors at play and we are certainly keeping an eye on it and I think across the country we need to redouble our efforts in terms of reaching all Canadians , including young folks . 
I think all Canadians have made tremendous sacrifices and we ’ve succeeded overall in flattening the curve but that success if fragile , " said Dr . Howard Njoo , Canada ’s deputy chief public health officer , during a news conference Tuesday . 
Ontario ’s Premier Doug Ford was more blunt , telling young adults they are " hurting people . " 
The latest numbers : Canada ’s case count remains modest , with the country now averaging about 450 cases per day compared to about 350 per day in June . 
Many provinces have started reopening bars and restaurants and while that has contributed to the spike in cases , public health officials say private parties among young people are of particular concern . 
" Many of the clusters of cases that are among the young adults are also associated with indoor parties , " said Njoo .
