Canadian officials pleaded with those returning from spring break to go home and quarantine for 14 days and then stay home indefinitely as public health officials worry about yet another wave of travel related coronavirus infections . 
Canada ’s Health minister was more blunt and suggested the government will use all measures in its " tool kit , " including fines , if returning travelers do not abide by orders to stay home . 
" When we say that you must stay at home for 14 days that means you stay at home for 14 days , you do not stop for groceries , you do not go visit your neighbors or your friends , that you rest in your house for 14 days , no exceptions , " said Patty Hajdu , Canada ’s Health Minister . 
By the numbers : Public health officials say there are now roughly 1,388 cases of Covid 19 in Canada , with at least 19 deaths . 
They add that they have tested more than 90,000 people , and are testing more than 10,000 people per day . 
Test results are still taking a full 24 hours as Canada , like other countries , looks for ways to speed up those results .
