Canada announced Monday that the US Canada border will remain closed until at least Nov . 21 . 
Canada ’s public safety minister Bill Blair tweeted , " Our decisions will continue to be based on the best public health advice available to keep Canadians safe . " 
Essential cross border traffic for commercial goods and essential workers will continue with many of those workers exempt from Canada ’s mandatory 14 day quarantine for anyone entering the country . 
The border restrictions were first imposed in March and have been renewed by mutual agreement every month since . 
Earlier this month , Canada loosened some border restrictions on compassionate grounds . 
Family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents , including couples , adult children , grandchildren , siblings and grandparents can enter Canada but must complete a 14 day quarantine . 
Canada says other foreign nationals can apply to come to Canada on compassionate grounds given illness or death of family and friends .
