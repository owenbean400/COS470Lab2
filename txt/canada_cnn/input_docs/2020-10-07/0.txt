Canada 's public health officials are warning people to stay home as much as possible saying the next few weeks will be " critical " to the country ’s efforts to contain the virus . 
Public Health Agency of Canada says national daily case counts continue to increase steeply with an average of about two thousand new cases every day for the past week . 
Government statistics indicate that ’s a 40 % rise in the last week alone . 
Hospitalizations and deaths continue to creep upward as well with more than 600 Covid 19 patients currently in hospitals , and an average of about 18 deaths reported daily . 
More than 80 % of new infections are from Ontario and Quebec with 60 % of cases detected in people under 40 . 
The province of Quebec is of particular concern with urban hotspots in Montreal and Quebec City . 
Dine in restaurants and bars were closed in those cities last week as new daily cases continue to climb . 
Quebec reported 1,364 new cases of the virus on Tuesday alone , the highest daily case total since the pandemic began . 
That prompted a blunt warning to young people in Quebec to take the virus seriously and stay home . 
More on this : Earlier this week , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Canadians to stay home even for the Thanksgiving holiday next week , saying if Canada can once again flatten the curve that the country can " turn things around for Christmas . " 
" We are going in the wrong direction now , which is why it is so important for Canadians to do what is necessary , to wear a mask , to keep your distance , to understand that each of us has the power to end this by the choices we make , " said Trudeau during a press conference Monday .
