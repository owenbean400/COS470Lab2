There are now 30 coronavirus cases in Canada linked to Bar Le Kirouac , a karaoke bar in Quebec City , according to the province 's regional public health department . 
" We are in the process of figuring out with public security whether this is a criminal matter , " Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé said during a news conference on Tuesday . 
Dubé said Quebec is considering imposing fines in the case . 
" We are talking about karaoke , where people who think that because they are with friends , they know well that they can relax , take off the mask , pass the microphone , get close to each other to sing together . 
These are enjoyable things , but we ca not do that anymore , " the minister added .
