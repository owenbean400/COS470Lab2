Canadian public health officials say they are increasingly concerned about the " acceleration " of Covid 19 in Canada but say it is not yet time for nationwide restrictions or lockdowns . 
Tam said this is a crucial moment for the country , especially in Ontario and Quebec . 
She warned Canadians that they need to cut down on social contacts as contact tracing is becoming more difficult and community transmission grows .

According to Canadian government data , there are now more than 14,000 active Covid 19 cases across the country with daily , average case counts doubling in just over two weeks .
