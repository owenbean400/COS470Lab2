An airline industry source with knowledge of the directive being sent to air carriers told CNN that North American airlines will not be required to suspend all flights between the US and Canada . 
Some business , diplomatic , educational and family emergency travel will be allowed to continue . 
The restrictions are meant to be applied to what the governments describe as " non essential " travel , in particular leisure visits . 
In light of this , North American carriers will soon begin dramatically reducing their US Canada flight schedules , the source said . 
The new border restrictions for airlines are expected to be enforced by March 21 at midnight .
