United Airlines said tonight that it 's cutting even more domestic and international flights , following the US restrictions on travel from the UK and other European countries . 
There will be a 60 % schedule reduction in April . 
This includes cutting international flights by 85 % , and flights across the US and Canada by 42 % , said the airline . 
United is making the cuts as it " continues to aggressively manage the impact of the coronavirus ( Covid 19 ) outbreak on our employees , our customers and our business , " the airline said in a statement . 
The aviation industry has been slammed by coronavirus . 
The pandemic has seen airlines around the world hit hard , having to cut flights due to dropping demand and a long list of international travel restrictions . 
Cebu Pacific , a Philippines carrier , announced yesterday that it was suspending all flights -- domestic and international -- one of the most drastic measures taken so far by an airline . 
Many other airlines have , like United , slashed flights and routes . 
Virgin Atlantic said yesterday it is cutting 80 % of its flights per day , and warned that " the aviation industry is facing unprecedented pressure . "
