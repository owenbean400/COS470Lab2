Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government is trying to give all workers a minimum of 10 days paid sick leave per year as Canada starts to prepare for a possible second wave of the pandemic . 
The effort is complicated by the fact that sick leave is usually a provincial jurisdiction . 
Trudeau said putting the necessary mechanisms in place for a national paid sick leave program would be challenging but his government and the provinces are determined to try . 
" When the fall comes and flu season starts up we do not want people who develop a sniffle to suddenly worry that while they really should not go into work but they ca not afford to not go into work and therefore the risk of contributing to a wave significantly , could be a real problem , " said Trudeau . 
Canada 's top doctor repeated her assertion Monday that a second wave of the virus could be worse than the first and encouraged public health officials to build up capacity for testing , hospital beds and PPE in order to prepare . 
" I think you can never be overly prepared and we have to just keep going with some of these capacity developments and that goes for lab testing as well , " said Dr . Theresa Tam , Canada â€™s chief public health officer . 
By the numbers : As of Monday , Canada had reported more than 86,000 cases of Covid 19 and more than 6,500 deaths .
