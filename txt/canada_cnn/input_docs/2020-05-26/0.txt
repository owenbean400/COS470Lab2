Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he â€™s " deeply disturbed " by a military report detailing conditions witnessed by soldiers when they were called in to help in senior living facilities during the coronavirus pandemic . 
" There are things in there that are extremely troubling and we need to take action , " he said without going into specifics . 
He indicated the province of Ontario would release more specific details later in the day . 
As of Tuesday , Canada reported more than 6,555 deaths from Covid 19 . 
According to Health Canada , nearly 80 % of all coronavirus deaths in the country are related to long term care institutions for the elderly . 
Some background : Both Ontario and Quebec requested help from the Canadian military as outbreaks of Covid 19 in long term care institutions worsened and staff shortages persisted . 
In April , Trudeau said " soldiers should not be taking care of seniors , " but his government was left with little choice but to grant a request for military help due to uncontrollable outbreaks of the virus , a spike in deaths , and a crippling shortage of health care staff experienced by long term care facilities .
