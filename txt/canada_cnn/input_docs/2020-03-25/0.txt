All travelers returning to Canada will have to enter a 14 day mandatory quarantine as of midnight Wednesday as the country deals with a significant spike in coronavirus cases and hundreds of thousands of people return home to Canada by both air and land border crossings . 
Canadian officials did not provide much detail as to how they would enforce this order . 
Canadian public health officials have been recommending the quarantine for travelers for several days . 
Canada also announced it was nearly doubling its financial support to workers during the Covid 19 crisis with at least $ 36 billion being distributed directly to workers affected by the pandemic . 
This will mean that a family of four could collect as much as $ 3,100 per month for at least four months through a combination of a wage subsidy and a child benefit .
