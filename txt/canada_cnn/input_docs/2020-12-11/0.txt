There was sobering news for Canadians Thursday as public health officials in several provinces said they were coping with an increase in infections despite new restrictions and lockdowns . 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau underscored the need to keep up with public health protocols as he announced that vaccines would arrive in Canada by Monday . 
Canada is not disclosing logistics or tracking information on the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine as it enters the country because of what officials say are " credible " security concerns . 
But Trudeau stressed he does not believe there will be any disruptions as the vaccines make their way from Belgium to Canada . 
The timeline on vaccines in Canada comes as several provinces -- including Canada ’s two largest , Quebec and Ontario -- logged record cases of Covid 19 in recent days , with officials saying lockdowns in both Toronto and Montreal are having little effect . 
Ontario released new modeling Thursday and confirmed that according to mobility data throughout the province , people are traveling outside their homes at close to normal levels and likely not limiting contacts as much as needed to stop the spread of the virus . 
Montreal broke a single day record Thursday with 648 new cases of Covid 19 , a growth rate the city ’s public health director called " alarming . " 
" I know we ’re all tired , but we need to make an effort , " said Dr . Mylène Drouin , Montreal ’s public health director , during a news conference Thursday .
