Plague outbreaks in London spread four times faster in the 17th century than they did in the 14th century , researchers have estimated after studying troves of wills and death records . 
Researchers from Canada 's Mc Master University analyzed thousands of documents spanning 300 years -- including personal wills and testaments , parish registers and the London Bills of Mortality -- to search for patterns on how the plague spread through the population . 
Plague , one of the deadliest bacterial infections in human history , caused an estimated 50 million deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages , when it was known as the Black Death . 
Researchers believe that factors including population density , living conditions and cooler temperatures could help to explain the acceleration of the disease in London -- and assist with our understanding of modern pandemics , such as the current Covid 19 pandemic . 
" A given pathogen can cause very different epidemics , whether it 's in the same place over time , or in different places , " David Earn , a mathematics professor at Mc Master and lead author of the research , told CNN . 
The findings could provide clues to how the current coronavirus pandemic , and any future pandemics could behave .
