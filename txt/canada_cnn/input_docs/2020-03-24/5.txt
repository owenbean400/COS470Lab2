Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he and his officials will " shift our posture , " if necessary , when it comes to stricter border controls with the United States . 
" We are braced for a broad range of scenarios , we have put contingency plans for next steps depending on what trajectory the virus takes in Canada or indeed around the world , " said Trudeau during his daily news conference outside his Ottawa home where he remains in quarantine . 
Border states including Washington and New York have become Covid 19 hotspots and Canadian officials are becoming more concerned about community spread as hundreds of thousands of Canadians return to the country from the US and beyond . 
The Public Health Agency of Canada says it has tested more than 120,000 Canadians to date and there â€™s an almost equal mix of travel related and community spread cases across the country . 
Canada now has at least 2,500 cases of the virus , with cases spiking by at least 25 % Tuesday alone . 
Canada has reported 25 deaths .
