The news was not good . 
Not only did Justin Trudeau ’s wife Sophie Gregoire test positive for the coronavirus after a trip to the UK , but that meant the Canadian Prime Minister would have to quarantine immediately , along with his three children . 
Although huddled together in historic Rideau Cottage in Ottawa , Gregoire would need to be isolated from her own family . 
And there would be no nanny , no grandparent , no cook , no one to help . 
Trudeau has effectively taken on single parenthood , while leading Canada ’s effort to battle a once in a century pandemic . 
" It ’s an interesting challenge to run a G7 country in this situation , he ’s doing it with kids running around in the background , they ’re playing Lego , keeping busy . 
But you know it ’s no different right now from what lots of other Canadians are doing , working from home right now , " said Cameron Ahmad , the Prime Minister ’s communications director . 
Trudeau and his wife have three children : Xavier , 12 , Ella Grace , 11 , and Hadrien , 6 . 
Trudeau 's 11 year old daughter Ella Grace has become his photographer of sorts , snapping a photo of her father in his study while on a video conference with other G7 leaders . 
In the photo posted to Instagram , you can make out the images of six world leaders on the screen . 
Trudeau has been venturing out daily -- but only as far as the foot of his front steps -- to deliver an update to Canadians on the pandemic and to take questions from the media at a safe distance . 
" He ’s enjoying being a dad right now and getting to spend much more time with his kids , " said Ahmad , acknowledging that Trudeau is coping as best he can , along with hundreds of millions of parents all over the world .
