Cirque du Soleil , the Montreal based entertainment company and one of the largest circus companies in the world , has announced it will file for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the US , according to a statement on the company â€™s website . 
As part of their restructuring plans , the troupe plans to fire about 3,480 previously furloughed employees following the halt in revenue caused by the government mandated shutdowns in response to the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The company says it currently employs " 4,000 people , including 1,300 artists , who originate from nearly 50 countries " on its official website . 
Cirque du Soleil has also received $ 300 million in new funding in an effort to " support a successful restart , provide relief for Cirque du Soleil 's affected employees and partners , and assume certain of the company 's outstanding liabilities , " the statement said . 
The company also hopes to raise at least $ 20 million from its largest backers through a " stalking horse " bid .
