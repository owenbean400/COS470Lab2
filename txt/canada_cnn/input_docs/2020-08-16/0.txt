For Farrah Dixon , the words come slowly and reluctantly , a measure of both how she 's been feeling during this pandemic , and how she 'd prefer to never talk about it again . 
" Sometimes I feel like mostly I 'm on my own . 
I learned to be independent at a young age . 
And I 'm not typically the kind of person who is going to reach for help , for that , perseverance , I try to do it myself first . 
I 've always been an introverted girl so oftentimes it 's difficult for me to open up and find the motivation , " she told CNN from her home in Norway House Cree Nation , Manitoba . 
" I was really confused , I did not know how to handle it at first . 
It was my last year of high school , so I was upset I did not get to spend it with my friends and have the senior year we all wanted , " says Farrah . 
" What really affected me was losing my grandmother a few months ago and I could not attend her funeral . 
I was 8 hours away , the roads were all blocked off , I was heavy hearted and guilty because I had not been able to see her in months , " she adds . 
But the pandemic is adding a layer of risk to young indigenous lives and government officials tell CNN the impact on mental health may linger for years .
