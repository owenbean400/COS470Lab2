Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government will not give in to pressure and rush vaccine approval , despite what some other countries are doing . 
Trudeau pointed out that the Canadian government has been under pressure for months to approve testing methods and therapeutic drugs on a more rapid timetable but that Health Canada has refused to do so citing safety and efficacy concerns . 
" We will not see testing protocols approved until they are safe for Canadians . 
We will not move forward on a vaccine until we are confident it is safe for Canadians . 
Other countries will make their own decisions and have already in regards to testing , " he said . 
Some more context : Monday the Canadian government announced new agreements with Johnson & Johnson and Novavax , adding to agreements with Pfizer and Moderna to reserve millions of doses of experimental COVID 19 vaccines . 
Canadian officials say they are in negotiations to secure other vaccines so that a ‘ diverse portfolio ’ of vaccine candidates is developed over the next few months . 
Canadian officials say they do not expect a viable vaccine to be distributed until early next year at the earliest . 
Trudeau also announced nearly $ 100 million in funding for a new biomanufacturing facility in Montreal in order to increase vaccine manufacturing to about 2 million doses per month by next year . 
This is intended to help Canada to domestically produce enough doses of an eventual vaccine .
