Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is looking into possibly easing some Canada US border restrictions that would allow immediate family members to reunite . 
Trudeau made clear that anyone entering Canada would still have to quarantine for 14 days but acknowledged that a number of families are facing undue hardship with the border closure . 
He said he would continue to look at ways to support families going through extremely difficult times . 
Some context : Canadians and permanent residents of Canada are currently allowed to enter the country at any time as long as they offer proof they will quarantine for 14 days . 
The US Canada border has been closed to all non essential travel since mid March . 
The current agreement , set to expire on June 21 , allows for essential commercial goods and workers to cross the border .
