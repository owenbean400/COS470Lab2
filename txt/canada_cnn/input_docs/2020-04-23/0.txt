Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would honor provincial requests to send in the military and shore up seniors ’ residences in a state of crisis . 
Echoing the frustration of millions of Canadians , he acknowledged they needed to pull together and " do better " to support seniors . 
" This is not a long term solution . 
In Canada we should not have soldiers taking care of seniors , " Trudeau said during his daily news conference in Ottawa on Thursday . 
Nearly half of those that have died in Canada from Covid 19 are linked to residents in long term care centers throughout the country . 
In Ontario , where there are well over 100 senior residences with outbreaks , more than 70 % of those who have died of the virus are residents of care centers . 
Trudeau also announced hundreds of millions more dollars for vaccine research and clinical trials for possible treatments , and testing . 
" Testing is key . 
We ’ve now reached 20,000 tests daily , almost double where we were earlier this month . 
But testing must increase even further before we can reopen and restart our normal activities as a country , " Trudeau said . 
Trudeau said that although Canada ’s efforts at social distancing were working , the research funds will ensure that the progress would not be wasted . 
Until there is a vaccine , Trudeau said his government would focus on clinical trials for treatments and immunology testing .
