Canada ’s top doctor is now recommending that everyone wear a non medical mask when leaving home , especially when social distancing may not be possible . 
Canada ’s recommendation on masks has changed over the past few weeks with early directives in March saying that masks did not play a significant role in controlling the transmission of Covid 19 . 
Tam said she had no regrets about those early recommendations , saying the science on the virus is evolving daily . 
" So it ’s when we got more evidence about asymptomatic and pre symptomatic individuals , although we do not fully understand their role in transmission , it is an added layer of protection , " Tam said . 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that he will wear a mask when leaving his home and when he cannot social distance in order to protect himself and others . 
Tam went a step further and suggested mask wearing may soon become a social and cultural norm in Canada , with more and more people open to wearing masks when in public . 
The Canadian government , however , stopped short of mandating that everyone wear masks , saying that individual jurisdictions in Canada and some businesses can implement that on a case by case basis . 
" For Canadians , thinking of it as I ’m protecting you , you ’re protecting me , is a very key concept . 
We have to again the trust of the Canadian public and get their buy in to do all of this . 
Mandating is one measure that some jurisdictions might take if they have to , " Tam said .
