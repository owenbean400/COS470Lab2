Canada released a new epidemic snapshot Tuesday and updated modeling that shows its epidemic growth rate is slower than in most countries , including the United States , but also shows a death rate higher than earlier predicted . 
Canadian public health officials say the epidemic growth is slowing . 
About a month ago it was doubling every three days but is now doubling every 16 days . 
However , Canada is now reporting nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid 19 , much higher than originally predicted . 
" We are seeing the tragic paradox of the epidemic playing out , " said Dr . Theresa Tam , Canada ’s chief public health officer during a presentation of the new modeling Tuesday . 
Canada is currently dealing with hundreds of outbreaks in long term care homes throughout the country . 
Government statistics released Tuesday show that 79 % of deaths across the country are related to outbreaks in care centers . 
" Outbreaks in long term care and seniors ’ homes are driving epidemic growth in Quebec , Ontario and Nova Scotia and are responsible for the majority of all deaths in Canada , " Tam said . 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that while Canada was flattening the curve , distancing measures and some closures would remain in place for some time . 
" We ’re in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen and if we lift measures too quickly , we might lose the progress we ’ve made , " Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Tuesday .
