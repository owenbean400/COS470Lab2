Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that while the food supply chain in Canada faces challenges , he will not force meat processing plants to remain open as President Trump has done . 
Canada is facing several Covid 19 outbreaks in meat processing plants across the country . 
The most serious situation is in Alberta where two large meat processing plants providing as much at 70 % of beef products in Canada have suffered outbreaks . 
Cargill shut a large processing plant in High River , Alberta , on April 20 after an employee died of the virus and hundreds more were infected . 
With more than 700 cases of Covid 19 , the Cargill plant is the country â€™s largest single site outbreak of the virus . 
JBS is operating another meat processing plant in Alberta on reduced hours after dozens were infected at its facility .
