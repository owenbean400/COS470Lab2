Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is urging Canadians to take Covid 19 " very seriously , as numbers continue to head in the wrong direction . " 
He added , " Our fight against this virus is not over , even as we 're preparing to say goodbye and good riddance to 2020 . " 
Speaking during a Friday news conference , Trudeau said , " Canadians are pretty good at making it through long tough winters , and this is going to be a longer and tougher one than we 're even used to . " 
Frontline workers in Canada started to receive vaccinations earlier this week . 
Speaking in French , Trudeau asked Canadians across the country to stay inside , wear masks and continue to social distance through the holiday season . 
" Christmas will not be the same way this year , but it 's still going to be an opportunity for us to be with a close one , physically or virtually , " Trudeau said . 
" Just like through this spring , summer , and fall , we will continue to be there for you . 
We will have your back , every step of the way , " Trudeau promised . 
" We will do as a government , whatever it takes , for as long as it takes to keep you safe and supported . 
We 're coming into the final miles of this crisis , and we ca not give up now . "
