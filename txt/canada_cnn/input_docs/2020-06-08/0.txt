Canada announced Monday that it would relax some border restrictions for immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents , including some who have been trying to enter from the United States . 
Despite the change , a 14 day mandatory quarantine for anyone entering the country remains in place . 
Trudeau acknowledged that this has been a hard time for some families kept apart because of the pandemic . 
" This is an incredibly difficult time to be apart from a spouse , a child , or mom or dad , " Trudeau said . 
Nonessential travel into Canada is currently restricted , and that includes travel across the US Canada border . 
That mutual border agreement is set to expire June 21 but Trudeau has indicated that " stronger measures " to contain the virus might be needed even if the border reopens to discretionary travel .
