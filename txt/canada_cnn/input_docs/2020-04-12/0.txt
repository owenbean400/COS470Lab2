In a rare Saturday session , Canadian lawmakers passed legislation that will subsidize up to 75 % of workers ’ salaries to avoid even more mass layoffs during the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , now out of quarantine after his wife tested positive for the virus in March , attended the scaled down session with a " quorum " of about 20 lawmakers . 
Opposition parties joined Trudeau ’s governing party to unanimously approve the wage subsidy scheme , which will cost more than $ 50 billion ( in US currency ) and will be applied retroactively to days worked since March 15 . 
A majority of Canadian companies are likely to qualify for the subsidy .
