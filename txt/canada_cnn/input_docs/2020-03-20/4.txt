Canada will return so called " irregular migrants " to the United States saying it is doing so to keep migrants and Canadians safe as its planning for the pandemic strains resources of border and health officials . 
Trudeau called these " exceptional measures " as they try to deal with an influx of migrants who must be processed and quarantined when they enter the country from the United States . 
Trudeau said most of the asylum seekers are in the US legally . 
Asylum seekers are already returned to the US when they attempt to claim asylum at official border crossings in Canada under the Safe Third Country Agreement . 
For more than three years , migrants have been using a loophole to that law which means it does not apply at unofficial border crossings . 
Canada also said the border with the US would close to all non essential travel as of midnight Friday . 
" This decision will be implemented on March 21 , 2020 , at which time the U.S . and Canada will temporarily restrict all non essential travel across the US Canada land border . 
The measure will be in place for 30 days , at which point it will be reviewed by both parties , " said the statement released by the Canadian government . 
Canada took steps to place the country on more of a wartime footing announcing its new industrial policy would refocus to fight Covid 19 . 
" Our objective is to increase domestic supply so that we have Canadian solutions ready to protect Canadians , " Industry Minister Navdeep Bains said . 
Canada also announced its goal was to be " over prepared " and announced that it had secured 11.5 million N95 masks and will continue to procure health protective equipment .
