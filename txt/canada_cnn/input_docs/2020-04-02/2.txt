Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced questions Thursday about why modeling data had not yet been released in Canada , as the Trump administration has done in the US . 
Trudeau said that modeling information would be released soon but stressed his government is reviewing data to ensure more accurate modeling . 
" How do we make sure the analysis that we apply to the data that ’s coming in , that ’s being published daily so Canadians can see it , actually makes sense and reflects what ’s going to happen in various regions across the country , " he said .
