At least 2 million Canadians lost their jobs in April , adding to the 1 million who were already unemployed through March . 
Canada â€™s unemployment rate stands at 13 % , the second highest ever recorded . 
Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would be even higher -- nearly 18 % -- if those who were not actively looking for work were included . 
Nearly one in three Canadian workers either did not work in April or had reduced hours . 
Trudeau announced that the emergency wage subsidy program is being extended beyond June , in an effort to encourage more employers to keep staff on payroll or to help more businesses re hire employees already laid off . 
Nearly 100,000 businesses have already been approved for the up to 75 % wage subsidy program .
