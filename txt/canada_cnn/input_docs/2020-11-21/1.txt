As Americans get ready to celebrate Thanksgiving next week , they can turn to Canada for a cautionary tail . 
Canada saw a spike in cases just three weeks after their country celebrated its Thanksgiving holiday on October 12 . 
Dr . Bonnie Henry , British Columbia 's provincial health officer , said she pleaded with people to keep their gatherings small . 
She also announced a ban on inviting more than six people into a home . 
One Thanksgiving party with an extended family actually led to 10 Covid 19 infections , including three babies , according to York Region Public Health , a health unit north of Toronto . 
The virus also spread to another household , infecting four more people , and to a workplace where two more people were infected with the virus . 
Cases like that and other helped fuel the spike in cases . 
" I think we need to consider all the celebrations that are coming up whether it 's Diwali , or Hanukkah , or Christmas , " Henry said , " and look at how we can regroup and focus on our immediate families and making sure we can support each other to do it safely . "
