Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned again Wednesday that the national lockdown would continue for weeks to come even though the country has , so far , been spared the worst of Covid 19 . 
" If we reopen too soon , everything we 're doing now might be for nothing , " Trudeau said during his daily press conference in Ottawa . 
Canada reported 28,205 cases on Wednesday and 1,008 deaths . 
Nearly half of those deaths were related to outbreaks in long term care facilities . 
Still , per capita , Canada has had fewer cases and deaths than the United States and most European countries . 
But Trudeau says that does not mean the country is reopening anytime soon , and certainly not by May 1 .
