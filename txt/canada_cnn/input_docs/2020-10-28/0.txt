Hawaii will soon allow travelers from Japan to enter without undergoing quarantine , as long as they present a negative Covid 19 test before flying . 
This is the first time Hawaii has allowed travelers from outside of the United States to do so since the pandemic began . 
The program follows the same guidelines as flights coming from the US mainland , with travelers required to get a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of travel from a group of pre approved testing providers . 
The first flight from Hawaii to Japan is expected to arrive on November 6 , with only 10 such flights scheduled for the entire month . 
If there are no unexpected problems , Hawaii Airlines , Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways intend to significantly increase the number of flights from Japan to Hawaii in December . 
" Welcoming visitors from a country that 's so dear to us is important , " Hawaii Lt . 
Gov . 
Josh Green said . 
Discussions are already underway with the governments of Canada , South Korea , Thailand and New Zealand about expanding the program to those countries .
