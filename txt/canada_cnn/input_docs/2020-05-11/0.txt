Hundreds of thousands of students in kindergarten to grade 6 were invited back to school Monday as Quebec became one of the first jurisdictions in North America to reopen some schools . 
Attendance was voluntary and many parents kept their kids home , but others made their way into " Covid classrooms " with strict walking and spacing requirements , individual desks and supplies and no gym class or recess . 
In Montreal , however , schools and most businesses remained closed for at least another two weeks as the epidemic in that city continues to peak . 
The city remains a hotspot for Covid 19 and is an outlier in terms of transmission , as most other parts of Canada have moved through the peak of infection and growth rates for new cases continue to decrease . 
" We are all worried about the situation in Montreal , " said Quebec Premier Francois Legault during a press conference Monday promising that schools in the city would not be reopened until safer conditions could be achieved . 
In other provinces across Canada , including Ontario , most schools remain closed . 
Ontario also extended its state of emergency until early June despite a significantly lower growth rate of cases and widespread testing . 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cautioned provincial leaders that any reopening should be slow and said all leaders were under pressure to ‘ get this right ’ .
