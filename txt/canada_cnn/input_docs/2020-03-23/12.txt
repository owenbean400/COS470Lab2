The World Health Organization 's SOLIDARITY Trial — which will examine potential treatment options for Covid 19 — plans to enroll its first patients this week , WHO chief scientist Dr . Soumya Swaminathan said during a call with reporters today . 
WHO announced last week that it had organized the trial to test coronavirus treatment approaches across several countries and compare data to find which treatments may be most effective . 
When the announcement was made , WHO noted that many countries agreed to join the trial , including Argentina , Bahrain , Canada , France , Iran , Norway , South Africa , Spain , Switzerland and Thailand . 
" Randomized clinical trials normally take a lot of time to set up and get running , but you can see that the team has been able to put together this trial , " Swaminathan said . 
The number of patients enrolled will depend on the course of the coronavirus pandemic , said Dr . Ana Maria Henao Restrepo , a medical officer at WHO 's Department of Immunization Vaccines and Biologicals . 
" Nobody knows how many cases we are going to have and whether or not they are going to occur at the hospital where we are setting the trial , " Henao Restrepo said during the call . 
In a separate media briefing on Monday , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that " small , observational and non randomized studies will not give us the answers we need " when it comes to identifying effective coronavirus treatments .
