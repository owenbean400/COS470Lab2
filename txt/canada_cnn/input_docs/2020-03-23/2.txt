Speaking to lawmakers on Monday , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the 2020 Summer Olympics is a possibility . 
This is the first time Abe has changed his staunch public position that the Olympics will start July 24 as scheduled . 
In recent days , a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the games to be postponed , while Canada said today it will not send any teams . 
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) responded Sunday , saying a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks , due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics .
