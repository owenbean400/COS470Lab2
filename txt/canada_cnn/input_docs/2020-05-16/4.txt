John Costa , president of the largest labor union representing public transit employees in the US and Canada , said at least 45 members have died after testing positive for the novel coronavirus . 
" My concern is we do not need to lose any more of our members . 
Our members know this job is essential . 
They know when they took this job , it 's 24/7 , " Costa , president of the Amalgamated Transit Union told CNN 's Ana Cabrera on Saturday . 
" We keep the cities moving . 
We keep the economy moving . 
We keep the front lines moving . 
But we need to be protected . 
We did not sign up to die when we took those jobs , " he added . 
More than 1,000 union members from New York to Seattle have tested positive for the virus , according to the union .
