Health authorities in Canada have approved the country 's first clinical trial for a Covid 19 vaccine , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said . 
While Trudeau did not discuss where the possible vaccine was being developed , the National Research Council announced earlier this week that it would collaborate with Can Sino Biologics Inc , a company based in China . 
The company 's vaccine effort is backed and funded in part by the Chinese government . 
The race to stop the virus : As of Friday , there were at least 118 potential Covid 19 vaccines in the works around the world but only eight were in clinical trials , the World Health Organization said .
