The Canadian government will continue to pay up to 75 % of employee wages until the end of August for some businesses , acknowledging the possibility of mounting bankruptcies as reopening in Canada proceeds slowly . 
While business organizations welcomed the extension , many say they are alarmed at the continuing damage being inflicted -- especially on small and medium sized businesses -- during the economic shutdown . 
Dan Kelly , president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business ( CFIB ) , told CNN that " it has been absolutely soul crushing to see what has happened to entrepreneurs who pride themselves on being self sufficient and resilient people . " 
In surveys conducted over the last few weeks , the CFIB says more than 1 in 4 small and medium sized business reported having lost 90 to 100 % of revenue because of pandemic related lockdowns . 
And yet , in a problem acknowledged by both business groups and the Canadian government , the wage subsidy already on offer has not met expectations , with fewer businesses applying than expected . 
Nearly 8 million Canadian workers now collect about $ 1,400 a month as part of an emergency benefit available to anyone who lost their job because of Covid 19 . 
That program may now be keeping prospective employees at home . 
Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government will look " carefully at the relationship between these two benefits . "
