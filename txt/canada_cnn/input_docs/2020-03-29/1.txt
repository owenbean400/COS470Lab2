Canadian health officials Sunday corrected erroneous data reported widely during a press conference Saturday . 
In a tweet , Canada ’s Chief Public Health Officer , Dr . Theresa Tam apologized for the error and said : " I misspoke on the percentage of hospitalized cases . " 
" There was an error made . 
Based on a subset of case reports with age and hospitalization data , 12 % ( not 30 % ) of those hospitalized were under 40 years of age , " Health Canada wrote in an email sent to CNN . 
The statement attributed the error to a lag in ‘ real time data ’ . 
" The case report forms lag behind the real time data , while they provide more in depth information for epidemiological analysis , " the statement said .
