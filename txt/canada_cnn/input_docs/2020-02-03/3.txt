The Canadian government is still waiting on permission , as well as flight manifest and document approval , from the Chinese government in order to repatriate Canadians in Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , according to the Global Affairs Canada Minister . 
In a Monday press conference , Fran√ßois Philippe Champagne formally thanked the Chinese and Vietnamese authorities for their cooperation , adding " it is a multistep process given the complexity of this evolving situation . " 
He explained that a charter plane is headed to Hanoi to wait for final approvals and said that Wuhan 's airspace is closed , which is why special permission is needed for a plane to land there . 
He later rebuffed questions about whether the slow speed of approvals was linked to Canada 's strained diplomatic tensions with China , calling the topic " inappropriate " and describing Chinese authorities as cooperative . 
The number of Canadians seeking repatriation has only recently jumped from two people to hundreds , he added . 
Members of a standing rapid deployment team are already on the ground in Hanoi and Wuhan to help coordinate , he added .
