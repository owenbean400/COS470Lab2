Canadian officials have fielded 325 requests for departure assistance from Hubei province in China due to the Wuhan coronavirus , according to a statement obtained by CNN from Global Affairs Canada . 
Ottawa is attempting to charter a plane to take Canadians from Wuhan back to Canada , the statement said . 
There are currently 543 Canadians in Hubei who have registered with the voluntary Registration of Canadians Abroad service . 
Since registration is voluntary , this number is not a complete picture of Canadians in the region or in China , according to the statement . 
Only Canadian citizens who have entered China with a Canadian passport will be allowed to board the plane back to Canada , Global Affairs Canada said . 
Additionally , Canadian citizens will need to have a valid Canadian passport along with a valid Chinese visa to board the plane . 
Canadians appearing with symptoms will not be able to board the aircraft , according to Global Affairs Canada . 
The country is still determining protocols for Canadians once they arrive in Canada .
