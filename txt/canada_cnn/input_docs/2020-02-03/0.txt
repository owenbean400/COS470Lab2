Canadian officials have fielded 325 requests for departure assistance from Hubei Province in China due to the coronavirus , Global Affairs Canada said Sunday in a statement . 
Canada is attempting to charter a plane to take Canadians from Wuhan , China , back to Canada , the statement said . 
Hubei is the epicenter of the outbreak There are currently 543 Canadians in Hubei who have registered with the voluntary Registration of Canadians Abroad service . 
There are currently 15,219 Canadians in China ( including Hong Kong ) who have registered with the voluntary service . 
Since registration is voluntary , this number is not a complete picture of Canadians in the region or in China , the statement said . 
Only Canadian citizens who have entered China with a Canadian passport will be allowed to board the plane back to Canada , Global Affairs Canada said . 
Canadian citizens will need to have a valid Canadian passport and a valid Chinese visa to board the plane . 
Canadians who appear to have symptoms will not be able to board , according to Global Affairs Canada .
