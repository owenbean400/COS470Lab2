Canadian health officials on Sunday corrected erroneous data reported during a press conference held Saturday , saying that younger generations account for 12 % of hospitalizations , not 30 % as previously stated . 
In a tweet , Canada â€™s Chief Public Health Officer , Dr . Theresa Tam apologized for the error and said : " I misspoke on the percentage of hospitalized cases . " 
" The case report forms lag behind the real time data , while they provide more in depth information for epidemiological analysis , " the statement said . 
Other notable observations from the Public Health Agency of Canada analysis on Saturday showed that people over 60 were more likely to be hospitalized with 56 % going to hospital for treatment . 
Of those , more than half were admitted to intensive care . 
The information showed that most of the new cases in Canada were from community transmission and not from travel . 
" We have now completed tests for over 184,000 people in Canada which is more than 84,000 additional people tested since Monday . 
In terms of the severity of Covid 19 in Canada , the percentage of cases that require hospitalization is approximately 7 % . 
About 3 % are critically ill and 1 % of cases have been fatal , " Tam said on Saturday .
