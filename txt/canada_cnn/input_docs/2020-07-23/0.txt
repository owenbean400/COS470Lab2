Canadian resident David Edward Ooi Poon was in Ireland with his girlfriend Alexandria Aquino when pandemic travel restrictions were first announced in March . 
Aquino was unable to get into Canada in early April , in spite of what Poon insists was overwhelming support in favor of their case as a couple -- shared bills , a mortgage on a condo containing Poon and Aquino 's names , and a common law relationship according to Canada 's definition . 
Aquino arrived in Canada only to be forced to turn around and head back to Ireland . 
They have been apart ever since .

The group 's message is often delivered with the tag lines : " love is essential " and " love is not tourism . "

Separated , binational couples -- some married , many not -- are fighting for their right to travel . 
They 're fighting for love .
