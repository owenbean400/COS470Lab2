A study released Thursday suggests less than 1 % of Canadians have had Covid 19 , although the rate of infection is likely several times higher than the number of reported cases . 
While the study mirrors one released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week , showing far more people were infected with the virus than originally observed , Canadians remain quite vulnerable to the virus . 
Canadian public health officials say the country did a good job of containing the virus but warn that given these immunity results , keeping the virus contained in only going to get tougher as the economy reopens . 
" There was early on this strange enthusiasm for herd immunity , that the virus would ripple through the population and we would all have immunity and we ’d all be fine . 
That was always reckless and misguided simply because of the toll the virus would take but we also see here that was certainly unattainable , " said Naylor . 
About the study : This early study examined 10,000 blood donations received in Canada between May 9 and June 8 . 
A larger , follow up study will be released in the coming weeks to get a more comprehensive assessment of the spread of the virus in Canada . 
The study makes clear that " doubling down on good public health practices is imperative " if Canada is to avoid a resurgence of the virus . 
Naylor added that Canada has to " up its game " when it comes to testing and contact tracing . 
" We ’ve got to be smarter and more creative about how we do tracing and quarantine because realistically we have perhaps about a year of this current stalemate , " Naylor said .
