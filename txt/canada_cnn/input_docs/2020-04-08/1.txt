Canada ’s national lockdown will continue " for many more weeks " as the nation studies how best to resume some economic activity , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday . 
He added that things " wo not be back to normal . " 
Trudeau said his government is looking at different scenarios , but it 's still too early to think about relaxing any social distancing measures . 
" It ’s going to be very , very , important to do it in a measured , graduated way that allows for economic activity to begin while preventing severe spikes in COVID transmissions . " 
By the numbers : Canada has reported 17,984 cases of Covid 19 and 391 related deaths . 
Per capita , Canada has less than half the reported coronavirus cases than in the United States and a lower death rate . 
Testing for the virus in Canada has been rigorous , although testing per capita has slipped in recent days .
