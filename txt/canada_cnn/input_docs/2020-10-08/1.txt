Canadian public health officials are warning residents to stay home as much as possible , saying the next few weeks will be critical to the country 's efforts to contain Covid 19 . 
Last month , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that a second wave of the coronavirus was already underway in most of the country . 
The national daily case counts continue to increase sharply , with an average of about 2,000 new cases every day for the past week . 
That 's a 40 % rise in the last week alone , according to government statistics . 
Since the Covid 19 outbreak started , Canada has had a total of 175,380 cases and 9,593 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Hospitalizations and deaths continue to creep upward as well , with more than 600 patients currently in hospitals in Canada with Covid 19 and an average of about 18 deaths reported daily . 
More than 80 % of new infections are from Ontario and Quebec , and those under 40 account for 60 % of the cases . 
The province of Quebec is of particular concern , with urban hotspots in Montreal and Quebec City . 
Dine in restaurants and bars were closed in those cities last week as new daily cases continue to climb . 
Quebec reported 1,364 new cases of the virus on Tuesday alone , the highest daily case total since the pandemic began . 
That prompted a blunt warning to young people in Quebec to take the virus seriously and stay home . 
" The young people that are not respecting the rule , they will have an impact on the system , " Christian Dube , Quebec 's health minister , said during a press conference in Quebec City on Tuesday . 
" Do not take the risk , please do not test the hospital system . "
