Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned again Wednesday that the national lockdown would continue for weeks to come even though the country has , so far , been spared the worst of Covid 19 . 
Canada reported 28,205 cases on Wednesday and 1,008 deaths . 
Nearly half of those deaths were related to outbreaks in long term care facilities . 
Still , per capita , Canada has had fewer cases and deaths than the United States and most European countries . 
But Trudeau says that does not mean the country is reopening anytime soon , and certainly not by May 1 . 
" It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out we 're suddenly back in another big wave of Covid 19 , " he said , adding that any reopening would happen in phases .
