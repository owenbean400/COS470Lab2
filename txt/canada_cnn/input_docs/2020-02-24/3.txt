Across the Middle East , flights from Iran have stopped and borders with the country have been closed as the region tries to keep the spread of a deadly coronavirus at bay . 
Iran is on the front line of the outbreak -- the health ministry has confirmed 61 cases and 12 deaths ( though one lawmaker in Qom claims the death toll is much higher ) . 
Several travellers from Iran have contracted the virus -- three cases have been confirmed in Kuwait , one in Bahrain , one in Lebanon , one in Iraq , and one in Canada . 
Turkey , Pakistan and Iraq have closed their borders with Iran . 
Kuwait Airways , Iraq Airways and Turkey have suspended flights to the country . 
In Lebanon , flights from Iran continue , despite a social media backlash . 
Lebanon has a large Shia population , many of whom regularly pay pilgrimage to Shia holy sites in Iran , such as Qom . 
In Qatar , passengers from Iran -- as well as South Korea -- have been quarantined . 
One Iranian lawmaker , Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani from the holy city of Qom , criticized the government ’s handling of the outbreak , accusing officials of covering up numbers . 
Farahani said 50 people had died from the virus in Qom , the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Iran . 
Iran ’s health ministry has denied his claims .
