Canada ’s National Research Council said Tuesday it would collaborate with China 's Can Sino Biologics Inc , one of the few companies globally with a vaccine already in clinical trials . 
The partnership could eventually see Can Sino ’s vaccine receive approval for human trials in Canada . 
According to the NRC statement , Can Sino ’s vaccine candidate received Chinese regulatory approval earlier this year . 
That allows Can Sino Biologics to move ahead with human clinical trials in China . 
It is one of only a handful of vaccine candidates in the world so far approved for initial safety testing in humans . 
The NRC said it would scale up production for Can Sino 's vaccine candidate at a government facility in Montreal , and that Can Sino was preparing a clinical trial application to Canada ’s drug regulator , Health Canada . 
The NRC previously collaborated with Can Sino in its work on an Ebola vaccine .
