3M , which manufacturers much needed N95 respirator masks , said in a statement Friday its employees have " gone above and beyond " to manufacture " as many N95 respirators as possible for the U.S . market . " 
The statement was released after the Trump administration formally invoked the Defense Production Act , requiring 3M to prioritize orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its N95 respirators . 
3M said it has been working closely with the administration and will continue do so , adding that it appreciates the authorities in the DPA because it provides a framework to expand their work while responding to the pandemic . 
The statement noted that the administration also requested that 3M stop exporting respirators that are manufactured in the United States to the Canadian and Latin American markets , which has " significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America , where we are a critical supplier of respirators . "
