The Calgary Zoo in Canada is sending two giant pandas back to China due to a shortage of bamboo . 
The zoo said in a statement that it usually flies in bamboo from China to feed the animals , but the Covid 19 pandemic had disrupted flights and caused delays in supplies . 
The duo , named Er Shun and Da Mao , were supposed to stay in Canada until 2023 as part of a 10 year agreement with China , but the zoo decided to send them back early out of concern that delays could worsen if there 's a second wave of coronavirus cases . 
A panda 's diet consists almost entirely of fresh bamboo , the Calgary Zoo said , and the animals typically eat about 40 kilograms ( 88 pounds ) of it each day . 
Much of the bamboo Er Shun and Da Mao ate before the pandemic was flown in directly to Calgary from China , but those flights have been canceled . 
The zoo said it tried to find new bamboo suppliers to keep the pandas fed , but encountered several logistical issues . 
They also worry that these new supply lines could be disrupted at a moment 's notice , leaving the pandas completely without food .
