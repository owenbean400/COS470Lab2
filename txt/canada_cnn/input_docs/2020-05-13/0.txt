Canada is looking to strengthen surveillance at US border crossings as discussions continue between the two countries about when and how to reopen the border to nonessential travel . 
The Canadian government is looking at administering questionnaires , contact tracing apps , temperature and medical history checks . 
" We â€™re going to be very , very careful about reopening any international travel , including the United States before we feel that it is time , " Trudeau said . 
Some background : Canada and the US agreed to close the border to nonessential travel in March and the current agreement , already extended , expires May 21 . 
There is still no decision on whether the border agreement will remain in place beyond that date . 
Canadian premiers and mayors across the country have expressed concern about fully reopening the border as the US continues to deal with Covid outbreaks and significant community spread .
