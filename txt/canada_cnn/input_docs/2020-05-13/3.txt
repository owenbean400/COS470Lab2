Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said negotiations continue between his government and the Trump administration about whether to keep the border closed to nonessential traffic . 
The mutual border agreement is set to expire May 21 . 
The agreement as it stands forbids any nonessential travel , although commercial traffic continues . 
Canadian business groups say the border has been functioning well , allowing for a substantial flow of essential and commercial goods to cross the border in both directions . 
Trudeau on Tuesday said that even when some border restrictions are lifted , Canada may need some " stronger measures " at the border to safeguard public health . 
Canadian public health officials are looking at enhanced screening , including temperature checks and medical history evaluations for travelers coming in from the US , including those arriving at land borders . 
" Different countries are facing different challenges and as we manage the spread of Covid 19 we want make sure that we ’re not becoming vulnerable from travelers arriving from elsewhere , that ’s why we made strong moves to secure , to close our borders including to American travelers at this time , " Trudeau said Wednesday . 
Canada ’s top doctor also said Tuesday that easing any border closures should proceed with " extreme caution . " 
" Of course , the United States being one country that still has cases and is still trying to manage outbreaks , they present a risk to Canada from that perspective , " Dr . Theresa Tam , Canada ’s chief public health officer said Tuesday .
