Mexico will conduct a safety review of Canadian health policies and procedures before allowing any more temporary workers to travel to Canada to work in the agricultural sector . 
" This is a temporary pause in order to determine the circumstances surrounding the safety conditions on farms , " said Oscar Mora , spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Ottawa . 
Mora said that Ambassador Juan Jose Gomez Camacho , on behalf of the Mexican government , has been in daily communication with the Canadian government to try and understand why and how hundreds of Mexican workers have been infected with Covid 19 , weeks after completing a mandatory 14 day quarantine in Canada . 
CNN has confirmed that two migrant workers from Mexico have died in the last few weeks and dozens more workers have been treated in hospital . 
The local health unit in Windsor Essex , Ontario , where the deaths occurred , acknowledges that communal housing on farms and cramped conditions in packing facilities and greenhouses has contributed to the virus spread . 
The temporary ban means that up to five thousand Mexican workers are currently waiting to come to Canada . 
More than 60,000 migrant workers travel to Canada every year for seasonal work in agricultural industries .
