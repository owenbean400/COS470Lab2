The Covid 19 pandemic and reductions in access to effective antimalarial treatment caused by it could result in up to 100,000 additional deaths from malaria in Sub Saharan Africa in 2020 , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
Many countries have reported moderate levels of disruption , the WHO 's World Malaria Report 2020 said . 
Modeling analysis showed that reductions in access to effective antimalarial treatment of 10 % could lead to an additional 19,000 deaths in the region . 
A 50 % reduction could lead to 100,000 additional deaths by the end of 2020 -- even if all prevention campaigns are completed . 
Malaria prevention campaigns involve long lasting insecticidal nets , indoor residual spraying and seasonal malaria chemoprevention . 
There were an estimated 229 million malaria cases and 409,000 related deaths in 2019 .
