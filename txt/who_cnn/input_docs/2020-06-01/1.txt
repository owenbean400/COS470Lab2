The Americas , especially Latin America and the Caribbean , are seeing a rapid increase in the number of new coronavirus cases , the World Health Organization said Monday . 
The countries reporting the biggest increases in new numbers : Brazil , Colombia , Chile , Peru , Mexico , Haiti , Argentina and Bolivia . 
Ryan said " many many weeks ago " the world was focused on South Asia and Africa as potential hot spots . 
Now , " to a certain extent , the situation in those two settings are still difficult , but it 's stable . 
Clearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable . 
There â€™s been a rapid increase in cases , and those systems are coming under increasing pressure , " he said . 
" I would certainly characterize that Central and South America in particular have very much become the intense zones of transmission for this virus as we speak , " Ryan added . 
" And I do not believe that we have reached the peak in that transmission , and at this point , I cannot predict when we will . "
