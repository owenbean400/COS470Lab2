Governments and individuals need to put " sustained pressure " on Covid 19 to reduce transmission and exposure , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization â€™s health emergencies program , said on Wednesday . 
Asked if countries are seeing a second wave of the virus , Ryan said during a Q&A on social media : " There has been this perception that this disease would behave a little bit like influenza , and it would have a natural peak and then it would disappear for a while , and then it would come back in the Northern Hemisphere in the autumn . 
I think we 've always said that we did not know that . " 
Ryan compared the behavior of the virus to a spring , explaining , " When we push the virus down , we suppress transmission . 
Release pressure , it bounces back up . 
Now you could call that a second peak , a second wave , you can call it what you like . 
What it means to me is this [ virus ] requires sustained pressure to reduce transmission , and it requires sustained commitment to reduce exposure . " 
The WHO official called on governments to work on suppressing transmission through testing , contact tracing and quarantining , while communities and individuals " need to do everything they can to reduce their exposure to the virus . " 
" In countries where we 've seen well managed efforts on the part of governments to suppress transmission . 
And where we 've seen communities empowered to reduce their exposure , we see success , " Ryan said .
