A new report from the Council on Foreign Relations says that while pandemic threats are inevitable , the US and global response failures that contributed to the spread of coronavirus are not . 
The report , released this week , was compiled by a 22 member task force led by Sylvia M . Burwell , the US Health and Human Services secretary during the Obama administration , and Frances Fragos Townsend , who led the US Homeland Security Council during the Bush administration . 
It says the US and other governments failed to adequately invest in prevention , detection and response capabilities to protect populations . 
There was an " illusion — but not the reality — of preparedness , " the report says , and while the World Health Organization had the expertise to lead a global response , " it is beleaguered , overstretched , and underfunded . " 
The US response , the report says , was " deeply flawed " and too slow . 
Health systems were underfunded , and leaders — including President Donald Trump — failed to communicate clearly or defend public health leaders . 
The task force recommended improvements in US and global pandemic responses by encouraging officials to : Deliver clear , science driven communications on public health matters ; 
Create a nationwide US strategy and capacity for testing , tracing , and isolation ; 
Adopt policies to improve the resilience of global supply chains for essential medicines and equipment ; and Establish a global framework to ensure the equitable allocation of vaccines .
