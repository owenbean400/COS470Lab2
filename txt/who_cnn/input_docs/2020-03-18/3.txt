The World Health Organization on Wednesday expressed concern about lack of information on coronavirus cases in the war torn countries of Syria and Yemen . 
Abdinasir Abubakar , head of the Infectious Hazard Management Programme at WHO 's Regional Office , told CNN that due to the current situation there that we might expect an " explosion of cases . " 
Abubakar said WHO is concerned " because the countries who might not be having cases are those with weak health and weak surveillance system . " 
So far , Syria , Libya , and Yemen are the only three Arab countries who have not reported coronavirus cases . 
All three are in the midst of ongoing conflict .
