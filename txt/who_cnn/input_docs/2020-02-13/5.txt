The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says it â€™s too early to make any predictions on when the novel coronavirus will be contained . 
" We do not know exactly where this outbreak will go . 
It can go either way , " WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told CNN 's John Berman on New Day Thursday . 
" One of the reasons why it 's difficult to predict is we still do not know much about the virus . " 
China reported 15,000 new cases of coronavirus Thursday , and Jasarevic explained the dramatic spike is a result of how cases are being tallied . 
" Now not only people who are confirmed by laboratory testing are being reported but also people who presented clinical symptoms and have been diagnosed clinically without going through testing , " said Jasarevic . 
The change allows untested patients to get the same treatments as those who have been confirmed , he added . 
Jasarevic said more studies are needed on the spread of the virus in the population in order to determine whether the outbreak is bigger than previously thought . 
" There may be more [ mild ] cases . 
People who do not see the doctor or people who see a doctor but are not necessarily tested , " he said .
