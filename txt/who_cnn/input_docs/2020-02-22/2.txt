The increase in confirmed cases beyond China has become a cause for concern , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Saturday . 
The increase in cases in Iran , South Korea and Italy " is also a matter of concern and how the virus is now spreading to other parts of the world , " he added . 
The director general reiterated that while there is still a chance to contain the virus , " the window of opportunity is narrowing . " 
While 80 % of patients exhibiting mild symptoms will recover , 20 % of patients with " severe or critical disease , ranging from shortness of breath to septic shock and multi organ failure , " require " respiratory support machines that are , as you know , in short supply in many African countries , " he added . 
The WHO has supplied laboratory test kits and 30,000 sets of protective equipment to a number of priority countries in Africa , many of which have " direct links to China or their high volume of travel with China . " 
" We â€™ve also published a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan , with a call for $ 675 million to support countries , especially those which are most vulnerable , " he said . 
There are over 77,700 cases globally , and at least 17 deaths outside mainland China .
