Xi made the comments while awarding medals to four people for their outstanding contributions during the pandemic at a ceremony today in Beijing . 
Among the four were the country 's top respiratory disease expert , Zhong Nanshan , according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV . 
Xi said China reported information on the virus " at the earliest time possible " to the World Health Organization " and relevant countries , regions and organizations . " 
" China is the first major economy to resume growth after the heavy blow of Covid 19 , and is leading the world in virus control and prevention and economic recovery , which shows China 's great capacity for restoration and exuberant vitality , " he said . 
China has been criticized for downplaying or even covering up the severity of the virus at the start of the pandemic , and for ignoring evidence that it spread from person to person until it was too late . 
China has repeatedly denied these claims .
