The US has sent supplies to Wuhan to assist Chinese authorities working to contain the coronavirus outbreak , according to officials from China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs . 
A batch of US supplies arrived yesterday , with American businesses and institutions also offering support , said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying . 
She added that the US would participate in a joint expert team consisting of officials from China and the World Health Organization . 
Hua 's pointed comments come after China blasted the US on Monday , saying that it was overreacting to the coronavirus outbreak , and feeding hysteria with drastic measures while not offering any substantive help . 
WHO weighs in : The director general of the WHO has also warned countries not to impose travel and trade restrictions in relation to the outbreak . 
" Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma , with little public health benefit , " WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement yesterday .
