As researchers continue seeking treatment options for Covid 19 , the World Health Organization on Monday warned against using " untested drugs " to treat patients and running drug trials inappropriately . 
" That â€™s why WHO has launched the SOLIDARITY trial , to generate robust , high quality evidence as fast as possible , " Tedros said . 
" The more countries sign up to the trial and other large studies , the faster we will get results on which drugs work and the more lives we will be able to save . " 
Last week , WHO and its partners launched an international clinical trial aimed at gathering and generating data on effective treatment options for Covid 19 . 
Currently , there is no known treatment for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
