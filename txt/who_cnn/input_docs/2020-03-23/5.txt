World Health Organization officials said that chloroquine , a drug typically used to treat malaria , will be one option included in a large , global clinical trial evaluating potential coronavirus treatment . 
This comes after the announcement President Trump made last week that the US Food and Drug Administration approved the " very powerful " drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus and that there were " very , very encouraging early results . " 
The FDA later tempered the President 's remarks regarding chloroquine as an approved treatment , noting larger studies are needed to draw conclusions . 
Currently there are no treatments — including chloroquine — that have proven safe and effective against Covid 19 , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a separate press briefing on Monday . 
WHO announced last week that it had organized the SOLIDARITY trial to examine potential treatment options for Covid 19 — chloroquine being one of them . 
" We understand that this situation is very complex . 
Everybody , including President Trump , is trying to identify treatments that could help their people . 
And I think everybody is interested in further exploring the potential of chloroquine , so we are , " said Dr . Ana Maria Henao Restrepo , a medical officer at WHO 's Department of Immunization Vaccines and Biologicals . 
Even without clinical evidence , some patients with Covid 19 are already taking chloroquine , but there could be harm in that too , Swaminathan said . 
Over the weekend , three people in Nigeria overdosed on the drug , which can cause seizures , nausea , vomiting , deafness , vision changes and low blood pressure . 
" We have no knowledge that it ’s going to benefit anyone , " Swaminathan said . 
" It is a really important point to focus our efforts on generating the evidence which could then be used to treat people properly and effectively . "
