Lamps that use ultraviolet light to kill germs can inactivate coronavirus , but they are not all safe and it is not clear how good a job they do at killing the virus , the US Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday . 
The FDA said ultraviolet C ( UVC ) wavelengths are better than UVA and UVB light at destroying viruses , but UVC lamps still have their limits . 
Plus the lamps only work in limited circumstances . 
There â€™s been an explosion of products on offer to fight coronavirus , including germicidal lamps . 
The World Health Organization warns against trying to use them to disinfect human skin , including the hands . 
In addition , some UVC lamps generate ozone , which can irritate airways . 
" Some UVC lamps contain mercury . 
Because mercury is toxic even in small amounts , extreme caution is needed in cleaning a lamp that has broken and in disposing of the lamp , " the FDA added .
