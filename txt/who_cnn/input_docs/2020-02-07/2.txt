The World Health Organization has warned of a global " chronic shortage " of equipment that could shield individuals from coronavirus — like masks and gloves . 
Following this news , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , reminded people that most of them do not need to be wearing masks . 
He noted that health care workers — especially those treating patients in China — are the ones who need the equipment . 
" The situation of a health care provider needing personal protective equipment is another more serious issue than masks for everybody , " he said . 
Health officials have urged people in the US to take the usual precautions they would during cold and flu season . 
That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds . 
If you 're the one feeling sick , cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze , and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch .
