Data on the Covid 19 drug remdesivir show that it has only modest benefits and is not a " home run , " former US Health and Human Services official turned whistleblower Dr . Rick Bright said Thursday . 
The US Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir Thursday to treat hospitalized Covid 19 patients -- the first drug to be approved for coronavirus . 
Bright said it ’s not an impressive drug . 
A World Health Organization sponsored global study found that remdesivir did not help Covid 19 patients survive or recover faster . 
" The FDA clearly has reviewed all of the data that they have available to them from the company to review the efficacy and safety of that drug , " Bright said . 
" It ’s not too surprising that another , perhaps even larger , well controlled study from the WHO would refute that data , " he added . 
Bright said that it ’s likely that larger studies , like the WHO ’s , would show that the marginal benefit of remdesivir may become even more marginal , depending on the population of those using the drug .
