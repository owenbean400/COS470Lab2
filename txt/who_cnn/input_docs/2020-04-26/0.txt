We still do not know how long antibodies last in people who have recovered from the coronavirus infection , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said on Sunday . 
Birx was asked about the validity of a scientific brief released Friday by the World Health Organization addressing the idea of " immunity passports " that said " there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid 19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection . " 
The following day , the WHO in a tweet clarified its earlier statement regarding " immunity passports " and antibody protection , stating : " We expect that most people who are infected with Covid 19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection . " 
Other research about antibodies : Birx noted that in normal viral infections , our bodies develop " functional " antibodies that can neutralize the virus , as well as binding antibodies " that help pull out those viruses " and kill them . 
" The CDC is not only measuring antibody but they are also looking and see whether that antibody is neutralizing , " Birx said . 
Simultaneously , the FDA is working alongside hospitals to determine the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in treating coronavirus patients to determine if the antibodies of a recovered patient would help those still infected . 
" So , all of that data together , I think , is going to create a very clear picture about antibody , " she said .
