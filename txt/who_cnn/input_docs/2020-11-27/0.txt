Vaccinations against Covid 19 might not start in Africa until the middle of next year , the head of the continent ’s disease control group said on Thursday . 
Nkengasong said the goal was to vaccinate 60 % of the continent 's population to achieve herd immunity . 
Call for leadership : The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said in a statement Thursday that their new analysis has found that Africa is far from ready for what will be the continent ’s largest ever immunization drive and urged African countries to urgently ramp up readiness . 
According to WHO data , just 24 % of countries surveyed have adequate resource and funding plans , and just under half have " identified the priority populations for vaccination and have plans in place to reach them . " 
Vaccine drive will cost billions : WHO estimates the cost of rolling out a Covid 19 vaccine on the African continent to priority populations will be around $ 5.7 billion . 
The figure does not include additional costs of up to 20 % extra for injection materials and the delivery of vaccines , which require trained health workers , supply chain and logistics and community mobilization .
