Dr . Mike Ryan , the World Health Organization 's executive director of Health Emergencies Programme , urged sick people and their contacts to stay at home in order to stop the spread of Covid 19 . 
" We do know these huge , long , long term lockdowns are not in that sense the best solution , " he said , adding that countries sometimes " face no choice . " 
The lockdowns have consequences he said , " but this is not a no consequence effort , we need to find that balance â€¦ between stopping this disease , giving us the time to develop the measures we need to save lives , " Ryan said . 
" Life is never like that -- it 's not binary , right and wrong , and left and right and , good and bad , " he said . 
" We need to take a pill and get real here . 
It 's not either or , it 's both . " 
Nobody wants lockdowns , he said . 
" Do you think I like this ? 
Do you think we want this ? 
No . "
