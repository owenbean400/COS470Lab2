All available evidence suggests the coronavirus originated in bats and was not a " laboratory construct " , World Health Organization spokesperson Fadela Chaib said at a briefing in Geneva today . 
US intelligence and national security officials say the United States government is looking into the possibility that the novel coronavirus spread from a Chinese laboratory rather than a market . 
" Many researchers have been able to look at its genomic features — and they have found that the evidence does not support the idea that the underlying virus is a laboratory construct . " 
Chaib says people should focus on facts – not " spurious theories " about the origins of the virus .
