The coronavirus pandemic is far from coming to an end any time soon , according to World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . 
" Although many countries have made some progress globally , the pandemic is actually speeding up . 
We 're all in this together and we 're all in this for the long haul , " Tedros said . 
" We have already lost so much , but we can not lose hope . " 
Tedros also said that Tuesday marks six months since WHO first received reports of cases of pneumonia in China from an unknown cause â€” which would later be identified as caused by novel coronavirus infection . 
" The six month anniversary of the outbreak coincides with reaching 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths , " Tedros said . 
" This is a moment for all of us to reflect on the progress we have made and the lessons we have learned , and to recommit ourselves to doing everything we can to save lives , " Tedros said . 
" Six months ago , none of us could have imagined how our world -- and our lives -- would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus . "
