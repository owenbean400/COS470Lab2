The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said a large number of scientists across the world are studying coronavirus and none of the genome sequences show the virus is mutating to become more dangerous . 
But WHO warns that does not mean the pandemic is not getting more dangerous . 
" There are more than 40,000 full genome sequences that are available , " WHO infectious disease epidemiologist Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove told a briefing . 
" Scientists are looking to see , are there changes in the virus ? 
And as it is a coronavirus — it is an RNA virus — there are normal changes in this virus that one would expect over time , " she said . 
RNA viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses are generally more unstable and prone to mutation than viruses that use DNA to replicate . 
But Van Kerkhove said that does not mean the spread of the virus is not becoming more dangerous . 
" People grow tired , " she said . 
They may become lax in the measures needed to control the spread of the virus , such as social distancing . 
" It 's very difficult to keep up all of these measures and we must remain strong and vigilant , " she said . 
As lockdowns are lifted , slowly , across the globe , some " social measures may need to be reintroduced again , and that may frustrate people , " Van Kerkhove said . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , WHO executive director of Health Emergencies Program , said the virus does remain stable , but added , " This is already a dangerous virus ; we 've been seeing this consistently for months now . "
