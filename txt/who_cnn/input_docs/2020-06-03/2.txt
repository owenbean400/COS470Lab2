The World Health Organization 's Data Safety and Monitoring Committee has recommended for WHO to continue studying hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid 19 treatment in its Solidarity Trial , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday . 
Last week , WHO announced that it had temporarily paused the hydroxychloroquine arms of the trial due to concerns surrounding the drug 's safety . 
" This decision was taken as a precaution while the safety data were reviewed . 
The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee of the Solidarity Trial has been reviewing the data , " Tedros said on Wednesday . 
" On the basis of the available mortality data , the members of the committee recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol , " Tedros said , adding that the recommendation about resuming hydroxychloroquine studies will be shared with the trial 's principal investigators . 
Currently , there is no approved treatment for Covid 19 . 
" In fact , it â€™s an urgent priority for all of us to do the needed studies , to do the randomized clinical trials , in order to get that evidence , " Swaminathan said . 
" You can do analyses but there are so many potential biases in the way that patients are managed in a regular clinical setting that the only way to get definitive answers is to do a randomized trial . "
