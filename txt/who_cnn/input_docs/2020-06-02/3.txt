Stay 6 feet apart . 
And , while you 're at it , wear a face covering . 
The " most comprehensive study to date " found that physical distance and perhaps the use of a mask were the best ways to prevent coronavirus transmission . 
The study , published in the Lancet medical journal Monday , found people should stay at least three feet apart -- and more if possible . 
The review of various published studies , paid for by the World Health Organization , had three main findings : Physical distancing : The chance of transmission at a distance of less than 1 meter ( 3.3 feet ) was 12.8 % , while that fell to 2.6 % at a distance of more than 1 meter ( 3.3 feet ) . 
It added that distances of 2 meters ( 6.6 feet ) could be more effective . 
It said that the certainty of the evidence was " moderate . " 
Face masks : The chance of transmission without a face mask or respirator ( like an N95 mask ) was 17.4 % , while that fell to 3.1 % when a mask was worn . 
However , the certainty of the evidence was " low . " 
Eye protection : The chance of transmission without eye protection was put at 16 % , compared to 5.5 % with some form of eye protection like a face shield , visor , goggles or glasses . 
However , the certainty of the evidence was " low . "
