The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is now calling for nations to encourage the general public to wear fabric masks in areas where there continues to be intense spread of the novel coronavirus . 
All health workers and caregivers are also encouraged to wear masks during their shifts . 
Here 's what the WHO 's new recommendations say : " In areas with community transmission , we advise that people aged 60 years or over , or those with underlying conditions , should wear a medical mask in situations where physical distancing is not possible , " Tedros said . 
" In areas with widespread transmission , WHO advises medical masks for all people working in clinical areas of a health facility , not only workers dealing with patients with Covid 19 , " WHO 's Director General added . 
WHO recommends that where there is widespread transmission , limited capacity to contain Covid 19 outbreaks and physical distancing of at least a meter can not be achieved , then governments should encourage their public to wear a fabric mask , Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO 's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit , told CNN . 
The new guidance recommends for these fabric masks — which can be homemade — to be at least three layers : an inner layer of an absorbent material such as cotton ; a middle layer that acts like a filter or barrier , such as non woven material polypropylene ; and an outer layer of a non absorbent material , such as polyester or polyester blend . 
Van Kerkhove also said to avoid materials that may be silk , stretchy or porous . 
Remember : These updated recommendations announced on Friday , are a shift from what WHO previously advised on masks , which was to not wear them if you are not sick or not caring for someone who is sick , in an effort to keep masks available for health workers . 
Tedros added that the new guidance was updated based on evolving evidence .
