Researchers in the UK have put an abrupt stop to another Covid 19 trial involving the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine . 
The Recovery Trial , a large UK based trial investigating potential coronavirus treatments , has stopped including hydroxychloroquine in its study due to there being " no evidence of benefit , " researchers announced on Friday . 
Other arms in the trial , which has enrolled more than 11,000 patients from 175 hospitals across the UK , will continue . 
As part of the trial , 1,542 Covid patients were randomly selected to receive hydroxychloroquine as a treatment compared with 3,132 patients who received the usual standard care . 
About the study : The data showed that after about 28 days , 25.7 % of the patients who received hydroxychloroquine had died compared with 23.5 % of patients who received usual care alone . 
" That is not statistically significant , but as you can see from the numbers , that result shows that there 's really no evidence of a benefit , " Landray said . 
Some background : Last week , the World Health Organization temporarily paused the hydroxychloroquine arms of its Solidarity Trial due to concerns surrounding the drug 's safety and in order to review its own data . 
Then on Wednesday , after that review , WHO announced that it decided to resume studying hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid 19 treatment in the trial . 
Peter Horby , chief investigator for the Recovery Trial and a professor at the University of Oxford , said on Friday that his colleagues and he have notified WHO about the data found in their trial and the decision to end this arm of the study .
