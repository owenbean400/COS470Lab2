The World Health Organization ( WHO ) announced on Friday that its hydroxychloroquine study trials will continue " for now , " despite UK researchers ' earlier announcement to end their own study as it concluded " no evidence of benefit . " 
" They are two distinct trials , with their own protocols , their own oversight committees and therefore we will continue for now and our committee will consider the data as it becomes available . " 
The announcement came after the WHO confirmed it had received notice from the organizers of the Recovery trial on Friday — a large UK based trial investigating potential coronavirus treatments — about the organizers ' decision to end the hydroxychloroquine arm of the Recovery trial . 
Last week , WHO temporarily paused the hydroxychloroquine arms of its Solidarity Trial due to concerns surrounding the drug 's safety and in order to review its own data . 
Then on Wednesday , after that review , WHO announced that it decided to resume studying hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid 19 treatment in the trial . 
" As Solidarity and Recovery are two of the larger trials , and moreover they have very , very similar study designs , we have been in touch , " Soumya Swaminathan , WHO chief scientist , said during a media briefing in Geneva on Friday .
