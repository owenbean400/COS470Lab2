The Defense Department will provide up to $ 60 million in funding for the vaccine , which goes by the experimental name NVX COV2373 . 
The company will make several of the components in the US . 
Novavax will deliver 10 million doses to the Department of Defense in 2020 that could be used in late stage clinical trials or under an Emergency Use Authorization if the US Food and Drug Administration approves the vaccine .
