Iran ’s supreme religious leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused any form of American aid for Iran 's citizens on Sunday , claiming the US might be planning to use medication against Iran . 
" Maybe the medication provided is also another tool to aggravate that disease , so we can never trust you , " Khamenei , considered the highest authority in Iran , said , without evidence , in a speech delivered on Iran ’s national TV for the annual Persian new year . 
He added it was " very strange " that the US is offering the country medication . 
" The US has shortages , they are facing acute shortages in terms of preventive tools , " Khamenei added . 
Every year , Khamenei appears in person to give the speech in the Iranian city of Mashhad . 
This year the speech was delivered remotely . 
Iran is the worst hit country in the Middle East with more than 20,000 cases and 1,500 deaths , according to the World Health Organization .
