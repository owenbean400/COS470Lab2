Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Wednesday the world may not eradicate Covid 19 â€“ but we may be able to control it with a vaccine and good public health measures . 
Speaking during a webcast hosted by the TB Alliance , Fauci explained that due to Covid 19 's ability to transmit from human to human , he does not think it will disappear like SARS did . 
" Whether it 's this year or next year , I 'm not certain ... but I think we will bring it down to such a low level that we will not be in the position that we 're in right now for an extended period of time , " Fauci added . 
Earlier this month , the World Health Organization also said it is unlikely that the world can eradicate or eliminate Covid 19 any time soon .
