Covid 19 will spread to schools if there is widespread transmission of the virus happening within a community , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization ’s Health Emergencies Programme , said on Wednesday . 
Ryan said that schools are " a microcosm of our society , of our community " and " a subset of people from our community . " 
" So if we have spread of the virus in our community and that spread is intense and is widespread , then that disease will spread to the school environment , " he explained while during a social media Q&A . 
He also said school environments are very important to communities , as they act not only as a place where children receive an education , but also as a source of nutrition and safety " in areas that are not necessarily as safe socially for kids . " 
Schools " are very important centers within our societies and within our communities . 
So we have to do everything possible to bring our children back to school . 
And the most effective thing we can do to stop the disease in the community , " Ryan added . 
The comments come as many US school districts are deciding how — and if — to reopen schools for in person learning this fall . 
Many major school districts are refusing to reopen , some even defying state guidelines , until coronavirus cases begin to drop .
