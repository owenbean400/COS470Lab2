Dr . David Nabarro , the World Health Organization ’s special envoy on Covid 19 , warned that the virus will not necessarily come in waves like influenza . 
In an interview on NBC , Nabarro said the WHO thinks " it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come , " until a vaccine is developed . 
Moving forward , he said there will be small outbreaks " sporadically , " and it is crucial that every community has a " defense shield " to isolate cases and prevent a large outbreak . 
When asked if the world ’s curve of coronavirus cases is flattening , Nabarro said that although there are signs of the flattening the curve in Europe and the US , the WHO is " still very worried and still very much on high alert , " particularly for countries with weaker health systems . 
Nabarro emphasized the global nature of the coronavirus problem , and called for greater cooperation between world leaders , saying , " I would like leaders to be a little more cooperative , yes please . " 
Some context : President Trump last week accused the WHO of not confronting the virus aggressively enough in its early stages , being too friendly towards China in its work and said there would have been fewer deaths if the organization had given " correct analysis . " 
Nabarro defended the WHO saying it must work with the information it is given by governments , and that " we believe what we ’ve got , we work with what we ’ve got . " 
He also mentioned how China allowed the WHO to investigate inside the country in February , and there were no restrictions placed on the team there , which included some American doctors , he noted . 
Nabarro further said that he " loves " the WHO ’s partnership with the United States , and that the director of the WHO , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , has spoken directly with Trump .
