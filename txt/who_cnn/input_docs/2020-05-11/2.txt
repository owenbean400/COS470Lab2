World Health Organization infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said globally , " there is an alarming number of health care worker infections . " 
" In some countries , upwards of 10 % of the reported cases are among health care workers , " she added . 
Speaking on Monday during a media briefing , Van Kerkhove said WHO is looking into where and why health care workers are getting infected , and working to reduce and stop the infections . 
" What we understand from the studies that are being reported and from teleconferences that we are having with clinicians and with infection control specialists , is that many health care workers have had contact with a known case that is among a family member , " Van Kerkhove said . 
Van Kerkhove said those who are getting infected inside the facility often come in contact with a patients in a ward that is not equipped to handle Covid 19 patients . 
Others are infected after spending extended periods of time in wards with active Covid 19 cases , inadequate personal protection equipment and sub optimal hand hygiene , she said . 
The pandemic is not over yet : WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that most of the world 's population is still susceptible to infection since many people have not developed antibodies against the virus . 
There have now been more than four million cases of Covid 19 across the world .
