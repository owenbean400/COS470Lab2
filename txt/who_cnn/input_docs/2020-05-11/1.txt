The World Health Organization warned in a statement released today that a review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO last month found that smokers are " more likely to develop severe disease with COVID 19 , compared to non smokers . " 
WHO noted that smoking impairs lung function and makes it more difficult for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases . 
Tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for many respiratory infections and increases the severity of respiratory diseases . 
" Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease , cancer , respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID 19 , " WHO said in the statement . 
Some context : Tobacco kills more than 8 million people globally every year . 
More than 7 million of these deaths are from direct tobacco use and around 1.2 million are due to non smokers being exposed to second hand smoke , according to WHO .
