Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that it was not the time for a leadership change at the World Health Organization , but did not dispute President Donald Trump ’s earlier call to potentially scale back funding for the organization . 
" In the meantime what our task is is to preserve and protect the American taxpayers to make sure that our resources do not go to places that are not going to deliver on behalf of the American people and the world , " Pompeo continued . 
" And President Trump and I are determined to do that . " 
Some context : In a Wednesday interview with " The Wendy Bell Show , " Pompeo said that " it ’s pretty clear that the World Health Organization has not lived up to its billing , it has not been able to achieve what it was designed to achieve , and we just ca not continue to permit that to go on . " 
" It performs important functions , important global health and pandemic functions , and we can see in this case we have not been able to deliver on that , " he said on the radio show . 
" So we need a global health organization that can achieve that and if this one ca not do it , then it ’s not appropriate for American taxpayer dollars to go towards it . " 
Despite Pompeo ’s suggestion that the US is not looking to replace WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus for the time being , a senior administration official on Wednesday said that WHO ’s leadership was part of their problem . 
" The problem is not the WHO system . 
The system has good people … It ’s about comments made from the leadership—which went beyond what I am told their own staff wanted to say , " the official said .
