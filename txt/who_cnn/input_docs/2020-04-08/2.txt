The number of confirmed Covid 19 cases on the continent of Africa has climbed to more than 10,000 and caused more than 500 deaths , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) announced Wednesday . 
Africa 's first Covid 19 case was reported in Egypt in February and the novel coronavirus has spread since then . 
However the number of cases has grown " exponentially " in recent weeks , according to WHO officials . 
" COVID 19 has the potential not only to cause thousands of deaths , but to also unleash economic and social devastation . 
Its spread beyond major cities means the opening of a new front in our fight against this virus , " said Matshidiso Moeti , WHO 's regional director for Africa , in a written statement Wednesday . 
" This requires a decentralised response , which is tailored to the local context , " Moeti said . 
" Communities need to be empowered , and provincial and district levels of government need to ensure they have the resources and expertise to respond to outbreaks locally . " 
The statement noted that WHO has been working with governments across Africa to " scale up " their response capacities when it comes to coordination , surveillance , testing , isolation , case management , contact tracing , infection prevention and control , risk communication and community engagement during the coronavirus pandemic .
