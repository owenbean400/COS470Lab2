CNN Corespondent David Culver is in Shanghai , China , bringing the latest developments there to the ongoing town hall . 
On Thursday , China reported no new domestically transmitted cases for the first time since the pandemic began . 
Here 's what Culver said : The reaction : " People are hesitant to breathe easy . 
They are still very reluctant to think that this has passed them , and perhaps , that is something the World Health Organization officials are grateful for . 
They say it avoids complacency . " 
Second surge : " They are portraying this as an external threat more than anything else . 
They fear imported cases . 
While the number of locally transmitted cases has sat at zero for the last 24 hours , since the most recent reporting , they say they 've seen 34 new imported cases coming from other countries . 
They are stepping up some of the screening procedures , and evaluations , of people who are traveling from all over the world , which is a complete reversal of what we saw a few weeks ago , when people were fearing traveling from China , now they are fearing folks coming from other countries . "
