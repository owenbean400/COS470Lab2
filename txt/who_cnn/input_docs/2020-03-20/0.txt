The World Health Organization has distributed 1.5 million coronavirus lab tests around the world and they will need 80 to 100 times that , according to Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program . 
Speaking at a WHO briefing on Friday , Ryan said , " If we look forward in this epidemic , and we project ourselves forward a number of months , and the amount of testing that is going to be needed , we need to scale that up approximately 80 to 100 times . " 
Addressing the impact on health systems , Ryan said , " Look at the intensive care units , completely overwhelmed , the doctors and nurses utterly exhausted . 
This is not normal . 
This is not just a bad flu season . 
These are health systems that are collapsing under the pressure of too many cases . 
This is not normal , this is not just a little bit worse than we 're used to . "
