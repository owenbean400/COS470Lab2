It might not be until 2022 when the world can begin thinking about returning to " pre Covid " life , Dr . Soumya Swaminathan , chief science officer at the World Health Organization in Geneva , said Tuesday . 
" We 're looking at 2022 at least before enough people start getting the vaccine to build immunity . 
So for a long time to come , we have to maintain the same kind of measures that are currently being put in place with physical distancing , the masking and respiratory hygiene , " said Swaminathan , speaking to reporters during a virtual meeting hosted by the United Nations Foundation . 
" Those will have to continue after the vaccine starts getting rolled out , because we need 60 % to 70 % of the population to have immunity before you will start seeing a dramatic reduction in transmission of this virus , " Swaminathan said . 
" We also do not know how long these vaccines will protect for â€” that 's the other big question mark : How long does immunity last ? 
And it 's possible that you will need a booster . " 
Swaminathan added that health officials are currently looking to control the coronavirus that causes Covid 19 , rather than eliminate it at this point . 
Swaminathan added that she does not think the coronavirus will become a seasonal virus as time goes on , but instead we could expect to see " ups and downs " in cases and transmission .
