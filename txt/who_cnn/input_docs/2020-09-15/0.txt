The World Economic Forum ( WEF ) said there is a " strong possibility " that the " current manufacturing capacity may not be enough to supply a global Covid 19 vaccination programme . " 
In a statement released Tuesday , Arnaud Bernaert , head of Health and Healthcare at WEF , said there are several ways this dire situation can be addressed . 
" More partnerships between researchers and manufacturers , are needed , " he said , explaining that one solution " requires hacking the current system . " 
Current funding " usually comes with obligations for the manufacturers to produce on the territory of the country providing financial resources , " he explained . 
This may result in " limited availability " of the vaccine in other countries . 
The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network ( DCVMN ) , which accounts for more than 65 % of vaccines produced in each WHO region ( except the European Region ) " needs to be put to work , " he said . 
Bernaert is suggesting a " pairing mechanism for vaccine innovators and vaccine manufacturers " – which would help find more capacity among the many vaccine candidates that are out there right now . 
By doing " The Great Reset … the interest of all prevail over the ones of an elite , " Bernaert said .
