Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said the threat of a pandemic due to coronavirus " has become very real " as the virus continues to spread around the world . 
" This is an uneven epidemic at the global level . 
Different countries are in different scenarios , requiring a tailored response . 
It ’s not about containment or mitigation – which is a false dichotomy . 
It ’s about both , " Tedros added , all countries must take a " comprehensive blended strategy " for controlling their own epidemics . 
What each country does to control the spread of novel coronavirus , " can also affect what happens in other countries and globally , " Tedros said . 
Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO 's Health Emergencies Programme , addressed the issue of a pandemic , saying the principle definition is that the disease has reached a point where it cannot be controlled , adding " if this was influenza , we would have called it ages ago , " Ryan said . 
One thing to note : CNN is already calling the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic because the virus has affected large numbers of people and spread to all but one continent , and because several places are experiencing sustained community transmission .
