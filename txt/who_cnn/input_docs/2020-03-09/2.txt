It can take several weeks to fully recover from illness caused by novel coronavirus , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of Health Emergencies Programme at the World Health Organization , said during a briefing on Monday . 
" It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease , " Ryan said . 
" People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness . " 
Ryan added that recovery is often measured by the patient no longer exhibiting symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests for the virus at least one day apart , but some countries may measure " recovery " differently . 
To date , there is no specific medicine to treat coronavirus illness , but those infected can recover with appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms â€” and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care , according to WHO .
