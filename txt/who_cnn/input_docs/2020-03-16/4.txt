The World Health Organization has issued new clinical guidance on how to care for coronavirus patients who are children , older adults and pregnant women , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing on Monday . 
" This is a serious disease . 
Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk , young people , including children , have died , " Tedros said . 
Additionally , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections . 
WHO 's guidance notes that " there is no evidence that pregnant women present with different signs or symptoms or are at higher risk of severe illness . 
So far , there is no evidence on mother to child transmission when infection manifests in the third trimester . " 
Yet " considering asymptomatic transmission of COVID 19 may be possible in pregnant or recently pregnant women , as with the general population , all women with epidemiologic history of contact should be carefully monitored , " the guidance says . 
Also , " pregnant women with suspected , probable , or confirmed COVID 19 , including women who may need to spend time in isolation , should have access " to appropriate care and " all recently pregnant women with COVID 19 or who have recovered from COVID 19 should be provided with information and counseling on safe infant feeding " as well as ways to prevent transmission of the virus , the guidance says . 
The guidance also notes that currently there is no evidence that pregnant women present increased risk of severe illness or fetal compromise .
