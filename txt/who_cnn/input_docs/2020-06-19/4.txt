Millions of Yemenis could be infected with coronavirus and up to 85,000 people could die as the country 's health system has effectively collapsed , the International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) said in a report today . 
IRC 's estimated numbers are based on modeling and data produced by Imperial College London and the World Health Organization . 
Yemen has been mired in political unrest and armed conflict , which intensified in early 2015 . 
Houthi rebels -- a minority Shia group from the north of the country -- drove out the US backed government and took over the capital , Sanaa . 
The crisis quickly escalated into a multi sided war , with neighboring Saudi Arabia leading a coalition of Gulf states against the Houthi rebels .
