More than 150,000 new coronavirus cases were reported to WHO yesterday â€” " the most in a single day so far , " World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a Friday briefing . 
Tedros warned , " The world is in a new and dangerous phase . 
Many people are understandably fed up with being at home . 
Countries are understandably eager to open up their societies and economies . 
But the virus is spreading fast , it is still deadly , and most people are still susceptible . " 
WHO urges people to continue to maintain distance from others , stay home if you feel sick , wear a mask when appropriate , and washing your hands frequently .
