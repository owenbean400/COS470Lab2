The World Health Organization confirmed there is " emerging evidence " of airborne transmission of the coronavirus . 
It comes after 239 scientists published a letter urging the agency to be more forthcoming about the likelihood that people can catch the virus from droplets floating in the air . 
Infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkove , with WHO ’s Health Emergencies Program , said many of the letter ’s signatories are engineers , " which adds to growing knowledge about the importance of ventilation . " 
She said the WHO is working on a scientific brief summarizing the current knowledge around transmission of the coronavirus , which should be available in the coming weeks . 
Alleganzi cautioned that more research is still needed on Covid 19 transmission . 
" These are fields of research that are really growing and for which there is some evidence emerging but is not definitive , " she said .
