Maria van Kerkhove , the World Health Organization ’s technical lead for coronavirus response , emphasized during a briefing Monday that the understanding of coronavirus transmission in children is still limited . 
The virus is less prevalent among young children , van Kerkhove said , while children about 10 and older appear to have about the same prevalence as young adults . 
However , she pointed out that children can have severe disease , and children have died from Covid 19 . 
" They can be infected , which we ’ve said from the beginning , but they do tend to have more mild disease , " she said . 
" In terms of transmission , there ’s quite a lot that we still need to understand about transmission in children . " 
In relation to schools reopening , van Kerkhove said that WHO has issued guidance on the safe running of schools and also on considerations of when schools should reopen and that there are a number of considerations that need to take place . 
These include transmission in the local area and the ability of the school structure to be able to implement measures like social distancing and hand washing . 
Van Kerkhove said they have heard of some outbreaks in schools , mainly among older children .
