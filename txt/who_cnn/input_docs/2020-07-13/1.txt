Two experts from the World Health Organization have arrived in Beijing to work with their Chinese counterparts on tracing the origin of Covid 19 , China â€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) confirmed Monday . 
" We have a basic consensus with the WHO -- that is : Source tracing is a scientific issue , and should be assessed and cooperated by scientists all over the world , " MOFA spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press conference . 
" The WHO also believes that this is an ongoing process and it may concern multiple countries and localities , and the WHO will conduct similar inspections to other countries and regions based on its need . " 
No further details of the WHO team 's schedule while in China has been released . 
CNN 's Kristie Lu Stout said this is what we know about the team so far : The team consists of two experts -- one an expert in animal health and the other an epidemiologist . 
This is an advance team , which means they are in China to determine the agenda , scope and scale of a wider investigation into the origin of the coronavirus . 
It is still very early on in this process . 
According to the WHO , the two individuals will try to answer two critical questions : The visit comes at a time of fraught political tensions between the US , China and the WHO : " We know the WHO has been under fire for its relationship with China , we know that the US under President Donald Trump is withdrawing from the WHO , " Lu Stout said . 
" So there 's a lot of scrutiny and pressure on this two person advance WHO team in China to see whether or not they 're going to get access to data , to samples , to files from Chinese authorities to Chinese scientists as well as , critically , answers just to find out what happened . "
