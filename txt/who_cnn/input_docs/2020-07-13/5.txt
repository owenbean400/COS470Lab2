Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said Monday " There will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future . " 
Speaking at a media briefing in Geneva , he added , " But there is a roadmap to a situation where we can control the disease and get on with our lives . " 
In order to get to this place , Tedros said that three things would be required . 
These are a focus on reducing mortality and suppressing transmission ; an " empowered , engaged community " that takes individual measures to protect the whole community ; and strong government leadership and communication . 
Tedros said that there are no shortcuts out of this pandemic , and that while we hope for an effective vaccine , there must be a focus on using the tools that are available now to suppress transmission and save lives .
