The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says the novel coronavirus is deadlier than seasonal flu strains . 
No one has built up immunity to the new virus , said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . 
He put the death rate for Covid 19 -- the disease caused by the coronavirus -- at around 3.4 % , but experts urged caution around this figure . 
Ghebreyesus said in a news conference on Tuesday : The new figure for the coronavirus is higher than the 2 % mortality rate previously reported , but many experts say it remains variable . 
Mark Woolhouse , a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh , said in a written statement on Tuesday that a significant number of mild cases could have been missed . 
John Edmunds , professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , said in a written statement released by the Science Media Centre that " it is surprisingly difficult " to calculate the mortality rate during an active epidemic . 
This is because " the time between onset of disease and death is quite long , " he said , so the number of deaths should be divided by the number of cases there were two or three weeks earlier .
