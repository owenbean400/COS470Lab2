President Trump tried to reassure the public that the fatality rate from coronavirus could drop as more tests are done . 
" I think that â€™s an important thing for people to know , " he added . 
More on this : In a news briefing on Tuesday , World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said , " While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains , COVID 19 is a new virus to which no one has immunity . 
That means more people are susceptible to infection , and some will suffer severe disease . 
Globally , about 3.4 % of reported COVID 19 cases have died . 
By comparison , seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 % of those infected . "
