The rising number of Covid 19 cases in the United States — especially among young people in the southern region of the nation — cannot be explained by testing alone , a World Health Organization official said on Monday . 
" I ’ve seen the reports that some of this is amongst younger people . 
That may reflect the fact that younger people are more mobile and are getting out and taking advantage of the reduction in the restrictions of movement , " Ryan said . 
" This is something that WHO has spoken about many times — many countries have experienced clusters of disease or upticks in the aftermath of reducing stay at home orders or allowing population mobility to happen . " 
Ryan added that continuing to follow guidelines to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus is key to help reduce this rise in cases . 
" Maintaining vigilance around physical distance ; personal hygiene ; the wearing of masks according to the national guidelines and where appropriate ; the increase of surveillance of the clusters that are investigated , testing , tracking , isolating cases , quarantining contacts -- this is what needs to continue , " Ryan said .
