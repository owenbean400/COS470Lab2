Worldwide demand for the steroid drug dexamethasone has surged since a UK based study last week found that it could help reduce the risk of death among hospitalized Covid 19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen , according to the World Health Organization . 
" Demand has already surged , following the trial results showing dexamethasone 's clear benefit , " WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news briefing in Geneva today . 
When the preliminary study results were announced last week , WHO said that it welcomed the clinical trial results . 
The findings are still being compiled and have not published in a peer reviewed journal . 
" Although the data is still preliminary , the recent finding that the steroid dexamethasone has life saving potential for critically ill Covid 19 patients gave us a much needed reason to celebrate , " Tedros said . 
Remember : Tedros said that while the drug was shown to have benefit for the sickest Covid 19 patients , no benefit was found among those with mild disease . 
" WHO emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical Covid 19 , under close clinical supervision , " Tedros said . 
" There is no evidence this drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventive measure , and it could cause harm . "
