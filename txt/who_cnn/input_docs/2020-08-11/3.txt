President Trump insisted once again that colleges should play football and made the very dubious claim that student athletes are strong enough to withstand coronavirus , even though several major conferences have postponed or are considering postponing their football seasons . 
" Hopefully we can watch colleges play football . 
We want to get football in colleges . 
These are young , strong people . 
They wo not have a big problem with the China virus . 
So , we want to see college football start and hopefully a lot of great people are going to be out there , they ’re going to be playing football and they ’ll be able to fight it off , " Trump said Tuesday at a news conference at the White House . 
Despite Trump ’s assertions that college football players are somehow unlikely to get coronavirus or experience its severe effects , several colleges and universities have already seen a growing number of student athletes testing positive for the virus . 
And though Trump insists that college football players are less likely to be severely impacted from the coronavirus because they ’re " young , strong people , " research shows that 1 in 3 young adults ( ages 18 to 25 ) are at risk of severe Covid 19 , with smoking playing a big part in their level of risk . 
And though earlier in the outbreak health experts underscored that older adults were most vulnerable to coronavirus , the proportion of cases in teens and young adults has gone up sixfold , according to the World Health Organization . 
CNN reported earlier Tuesday that the Pac 12 has postponed all sports including football through the calendar year and the Big Ten conference has postponed the 2020 football season . 
Other universities and conferences have also announce a pause on college sports . 
The President concluded by telling players to stand for the American flag and the national anthem , claiming that the NBA and NFL had had poor ratings for allowing players to protest during the song .
