Italy may have 10 times more cases of coronavirus than have been officially certified , the head of the country ’s civil protection agency said Tuesday . 
His office told CNN the quote was accurate . 
That would mean Italy would have had more than 600,000 positive cases of coronavirus , according to Borrelli ’s estimate , having recorded a total of 63,967 cases as of Monday . 
It could also potentially help explain what seems to be a much higher death rate in Italy than in other countries . 
According to World Health Organization statistics , as of March 22 , Italy had a death rate of more than 9 % of all confirmed cases . 
If the country actually has had ten times as many cases as recorded , the death rate would be 0.9 % . 
This would be more in line with the 0.6 % death rate in South Korea , for example . 
Civil protection agency data Tuesday showed a slight decrease in the number of cases for a second consecutive day , but only in the " next few hours we will see if the growth curve is really starting to flatten , " Borrelli said . 
" We should buy more ventilators and masks should be sold at every street corner , " said Borrelli , admitting difficulties in finding these medical supplies .
