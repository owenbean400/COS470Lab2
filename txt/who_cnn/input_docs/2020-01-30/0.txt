As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to rise , the head of the World Health Organization 's Health Emergencies Programme Michael Ryan has said , " The whole world needs to be on alert now . " 
" The whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that come , either from the original epicenter or from other epicenters that become established , " Ryan told reporters Wednesday . 
His comments come as the WHO will reconvene an emergency committee on Thursday to advise the agency on whether the coronavirus outbreak meets the definition of a public health emergency of international concern , the agency announced . 
WHO leadership called the committee back together due to the " potential for a much larger outbreak , " WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said . 
Ghebreyesus said that , while nearly 99 % of cases have occurred in China , cases of person to person transmission in a handful of other countries have become a cause for concern . 
Last week , the organization said the virus was an emergency in China , but does not yet constitute an international public health emergency . 
Still , in daily situation reports , the WHO has listed its risk assessment as " very high in China , high at the regional level and high at the global level . " 
Ryan said that many countries are taking action at borders and around travel â€” and one advantage of declaring an emergency is the ability to better coordinate the global response .
