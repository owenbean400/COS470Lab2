The United States remains on target to have a Covid 19 vaccine available by the end of the year or early next year , US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said on Thursday . 
" FDA has given authorization to proceed with clinical trials for four separate vaccines and we 've seen a number of vaccine developers come forward -- double digit numbers -- so we have a lot of different , if you will , shots on goal with respect to vaccines . 
That 's good news , " Hahn told ABC 's Whit Johnson during an appearance on Good Morning America . 
Cautiously optimistic : " We expect two of these vaccines to go in the late stage of clinical trials , which are large clinical trials , in this month , " Hahn said . 
" We are on target to reach a vaccine by year 's end or early next year , so I 'm cautiously optimistic . 
Of course it depends upon the data that are generated from the trial . " 
Hahn added that FDA 's job is to assess the data and science from the trials to determine the safety and efficacy of that vaccine . 
According to the World Health Organization , there are 17 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation globally .
