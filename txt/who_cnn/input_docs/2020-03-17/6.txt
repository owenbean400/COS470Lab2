The details of a study that found the novel coronavirus could remain on contaminated plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine as a correspondence to the editor . 
The study — funded by the National Institutes of Health — was posted online last week . 
For the study , researchers compared the " surface stability " of the novel coronavirus with that of the SARS Co V 1 virus , which sparked the SARS epidemic that started in 2002 . 
The researchers found that the novel coronavirus could be detected on ... 
Copper for up to four hours Cardboard for up to 24 hours Plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours . 
Also , the coronavirus could linger in aerosols — the suspension of tiny particles or droplets in the air — for up to three hours , according to the study . 
SARS Co V 2 — the name of the novel coronavirus — and SARS Co V 1 " was similar to that of SARS Co V 1 under the experimental circumstances tested , " the researchers wrote in the study . 
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals . 
In rare cases , they are what scientists call zoonotic , meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans . 
Researchers have estimated that coronaviruses can linger on surfaces from just hours to more than a week . 
A study published last month in The Journal of Hospital Infection found that human coronaviruses , such as SARS , have been found to persist on inanimate surfaces — including metal , glass or plastic surfaces — for as long as nine days if that surface had not been disinfected . 
Researchers continue to investigate just how long the novel coronavirus can linger on surfaces and even in the air , Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , World Health Organization infectious disease epidemiologist , said during a media briefing on Monday .
