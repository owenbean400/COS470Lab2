A total of 101 coronavirus cases have been linked to a nightclub cluster in South Korea , Seoul Mayor Park Won soon said today . 
The cluster emerged in the capital 's Itaewon entertainment district over the past few days , raising fears of a second wave of infections . 
So far 7,272 people in Seoul have been tested in relation to the nightclub cluster , Park said . 
An estimated 10,905 people were in the vicinity of Itaewon clubs last week , according to phone signal tower records . 
The city sent a text message to all the numbers identified and asked them to be tested . 
The number of people getting tested doubled after officials began offering anonymous testing , Park said . 
The city also secured a list of nearly 500 people who were in the affected area through credit card records , and asked them to be tested and to self quarantine . 
Seoul is now conducting random checks of clubs , and entertainment venues to enforce a closure order , Park said . 
Second wave : South Korea has been heralded internationally as an example of a country that got its coronavirus response right , largely containing the outbreak through aggressive testing , quarantining , and contact tracing measures . 
But the World Health Organization warned yesterday that countries lifting restrictions , including South Korea , saw an uptick in new cases over the weekend .
