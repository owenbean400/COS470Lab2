Coronavirus will not go away by itself and rather it needs to be pushed down using public health care measures , said Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program . 
Everyone has talked about flatting the curve , Ryan said , but " the question is how do you go down ? 
And going down , is not just about a lockdown and let go . 
To get down from the numbers , not just stabilize , requires a re doubling of public health efforts , to push down . 
It wo not go down by itself , it will be pushed down . " 
Speaking on Monday , Ryan said lockdowns are essential , because it means fewer people will be exposed to the virus , " so there are less people at risk from any individual case . 
If you get those cases out of the community quickly , they ’ll expose even less people , and that ’s how you get ahead of an epidemic . " 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , World Health Organization infectious disease epidemiologist , added we need to focus on the now , " we need to focus on what must be done now to get us out of this . "
