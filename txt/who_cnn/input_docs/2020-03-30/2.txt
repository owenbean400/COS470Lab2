World Health Organization officials on Monday said they still recommend not to wear face masks unless you are sick with Covid 19 or caring for someone who is sick . 
" There also is the issue that we have a massive global shortage , " Ryan said about masks and other medical supplies . 
" Right now the people most at risk from this virus are frontline health workers who are exposed to the virus every second of every day . 
The thought of them not having masks is horrific . " 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO infectious disease epidemiologist , also said during Monday 's briefing that it is important " we prioritize the use of masks for those who need it most , " which would be frontline healthcare workers . 
" In the community , we do not recommend the use of wearing masks unless you yourself are sick and as a measure to prevent onward spread from you if you are ill , " Van Kerkhove said . 
" The masks that we recommend are for people who are at home and who are sick and for those individuals who are caring for those people who are home that are sick . "
