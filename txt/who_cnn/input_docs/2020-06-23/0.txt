The drug maker Sanofi does not expect to begin human trials for one of its Covid 19 vaccine candidates until September at the earliest , the company announced Tuesday . 
The Phase 1/2 study will test a vaccine approach that Sanofi has used previously to produce an influenza vaccine . 
Development of the vaccine has been expedited with more than $ 30 million in funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
Sanofi said it hopes to have full approval of the vaccine by the first half of 2021 and aims to produce 1 billion doses . 
The vaccine may require one or more booster doses , according to a presentation made to investors . 
Sanofi is also developing a second Covid 19 vaccine candidate . 
The company expects a human trial for that vaccine approach to start by the end of the year , with a goal of getting approval as early as the second half of 2021 . 
The company says it expects to be able to supply 90-360 million doses of that vaccine annually . 
Thirteen Covid 19 vaccine candidates are currently in human clinical trials , according to the World Health Organization .
