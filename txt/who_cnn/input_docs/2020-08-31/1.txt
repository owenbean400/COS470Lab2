A top World Health Organization official praised Sweden ’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Monday , saying its approach has been mischaracterized . 
Sweden ’s government has been widely criticized for seeking herd immunity by allowing the virus to burn through the population . 
But Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization ’s Health Emergencies Program , said it was not true that Sweden has not implemented control measures . 
This is based on historically very high levels of trust between the Swedish government and its people , Ryan said . 
" That is the way in which Swedish people , the Swedish government interact , " he said . 
" That is the social contract in Sweden . " 
He said that it is wrong to suggest that Sweden had an altogether different approach to Covid 19 than the rest of Europe and that it had an " approach of light touch regulation of the process . " 
Ryan singled out Anders Tegnell , an epidemiologist at Sweden ’s Public Health Agency , which advises the country ’s government on health matters . 
" I think even in Sweden , Anders Tegnell and the team there have done a good job , " Ryan said . 
" Each government has to find its way , with its population to control the disease and there are lessons to learn from every country and its approach , " he added . 
" No country has done perfectly . 
All countries have made mistakes , but all countries have done some things correctly , " he added .
