The World Health Organization warns that countries ' abilities to respond to the coronavirus outbreak are being compromised by shortages and other disruptions to the global supply of the personal protective equipment needed for health care workers . 
Tedros added that WHO predicts that each month , about 89 million medical masks , 76 million examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles will be required globally for health care workers to respond to the coronavirus outbreak . 
" Prices of surgical masks have increased six fold , N95 respirators have more than tripled , and gowns cost twice as much . 
Supplies can take months to deliver , market manipulation is widespread , and stocks are often sold to the highest bidder , " Tedros said . 
" WHO has shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries , but supplies are rapidly depleting . " 
WHO has guidelines available for countries to follow on how to rationalize the use of personal protective equipment — also called PPE — in health facilities and manage supply chains effectively . 
" We ’re also working with governments , manufacturers and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to boost production and secure supplies for critically affected and at risk countries , " Tedros said . 
" Globally , it is estimated that PPE supplies need to be increased by 40 % . "
