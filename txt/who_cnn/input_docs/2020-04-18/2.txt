The World Health Organization has warned there is no evidence to suggest the presence of antibodies in blood can determine whether someone has immunity to the coronavirus . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , the WHO â€™s executive director for health emergencies , said Friday there was no indication so far that a large proportion of the population had developed immunity . 
The number of recovered coronavirus patients who have retested positive for the virus has raised concerns about how antibodies work in response to Covid 19 . 
While scientists say there is no evidence yet that a person who has retested positive can spread the virus further , there have not been any conclusive studies to rule that out . 
Professor Chris Dye , of the Oxford Martin School at Britain 's University of Oxford , said substantial work to develop accurate antibody tests for coronavirus infection was ongoing . 
" The WHO are right to highlight that any antibody test , if we get one , wo not be able to definitely say whether someone is immune to the infection , because we just do not know enough yet about how immunity works with Covid 19 , " he told the Science Media Centre . 
Such tests would need to be sensitive enough to ensure that infections were not missed , and specific enough to be confident that a positive result is correct , he said . 
" Before an antibody test can be used to indicate that someone is immune to further infection , the level of protection must be demonstrated in experimental trials , " Dye added .
