A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expert said officials are " hopeful " coronavirus could be seasonal and decline in the warmer months — but they wo not know for sure until spring and summer come . 
The CDC ’s Dr . Nancy Messonnier was asked moments ago about President Trump 's optimism about coronavirus . 
Earlier today , he said of the novel coronavirus : " I think that ’s a problem that ’s going to go away . " 
Trump 's comments contradict public assessments by the CDC , the US Department of Health and Human Services , the World Health Organization and many others . 
" What information is your agency specifically giving the President and the White House about the current state of the coronavirus outbreak ? " 
CNN asked Messonnier today . 
Messonnier said her agency briefs the White House task force on coronavirus daily . 
" In terms of the course of this illness , we have , again , a team of mathematical modelers working with us to try to predict the trajectory , " Messonnier said . 
" One hypothesis is that we could be hopeful that this could potentially be seasonal . 
Other viral respiratory diseases are seasonal , including influenza – and in many viral respiratory diseases , we do see a decrease in disease in spring and summer . "
