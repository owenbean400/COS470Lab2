All 54 countries in Africa have expressed interest in a plan to guarantee fair and equitable access to Covid 19 vaccines , the World Health Organization â€™s Area Manager in Immunization and Vaccine Development , Dr . Richard Mihigo , says . 
The initial doses will cover 20 % of Africa 's population and prioritize frontline health care workers and vulnerable groups with pre existing conditions . 
Higher and middle income countries on the continent have agreed to self finance their doses , but the remaining countries will be eligible to receive financial support through the initiative . 
South Africa remains the only country on the continent currently running clinical trials for the Astra Zeneca and Novavax vaccines , but other countries including Uganda and Kenya have expressed interest in starting clinical trials , Mihigo added . 
" Whenever an effective and safe vaccine is available , it will be available to all the people of Africa at the same time as the developed world , " Mihigo said .
