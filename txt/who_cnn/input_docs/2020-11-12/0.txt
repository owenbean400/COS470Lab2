Clinical trials for Covid 19 vaccine candidates should not stop just because one or two are found to be effective , World Health Organization chief scientist Dr . Soumya Swaminathan said Wednesday . 
Swaminathan said that some vaccines may work better in different populations , e.g . : Some may work better in elderly people Some may be safer for use in pregnant women Some may provide longer protection than others . 
She added that it was good to see so many people volunteering to be part of the trials globally . 
" That ’s really altruistic of them to do that , " she said . 
Swaminathan said preventive measures against Covid 19 , such as mask use and social distancing , need to be kept up for a long time . 
" I think it ’s really good to keep our expectations also realistic , " she said . 
" While we hope we ’ll get more good news about vaccines , it ’s going to take time to scale up production to get them out to all the countries and then get enough people vaccinated so life goes back to pre Covid days . "
