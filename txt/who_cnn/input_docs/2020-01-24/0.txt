It is all but certain that there will be a confirmed case of the Wuhan coronavirus in the UK , a health expert told CNN . 
Mark Woolhouse , a professor of infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh , warned that previous experience shows that airport screening will not stop the spread of a virus . 
" Sooner or later we ’ll get a case in the UK , " said Woolhouse . 
He would not comment on any current suspected cases . 
There have been no confirmed cases in the UK so far . 
Woolhouse said that under World Health Organization ( WHO ) guidelines , anyone who experiences flu like symptoms and has been to Wuhan , or has even been in contact with someone who has been there , is being tested . 
As that is a " very broad category , " he said he ’s not surprised at the number of potential cases being tested in the UK . 
He cautioned about airport screenings , saying that research on previous outbreaks , such as SARS and swine flu , showed that this was not a very effective tool . 
" That does not mean we should not be doing it , but we absolutely ca not rely on it , " he said . 
So far , he said that the Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate appears to be " considerably lower " than for SARS . 
( Yesterday the World Health Organization estimated it to be 4 % . ) 
The virus does appear to be spreading more quickly than SARS , Woolhouse said , which had fewer than 10,000 cases worldwide after several months .
