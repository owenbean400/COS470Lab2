For the past week it 's been the question which has raged around the world -- where in Wuhan did the novel coronavirus originate ? 
The most common explanation is that the virus jumped from animals to humans in the Wuhan seafood market , where wild animals were being stored in unhygienic conditions alongside humans . 
But in the past week , the United States government , and especially allies of President Donald Trump , have been suggesting the virus escaped from either the Wuhan Institute of Virology or perhaps the nearby Chinese Centers for Disease Control laboratory where it was being studied . 
" I would just say , at this point , it 's inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural ( origin ) . 
But we do not know for certain , " Joint Chief of Staff Chairman Mark Milley told reporters on April 14 . 
The Chinese government has strongly denied the accusation . 
" The head of the World Health Organization has repeatedly stated that there has not been any evidence pointing to the virus being lab created , " Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on April 16 . 
CNN requested to visit the Institute of Virology lab or to speak to a spokesperson during our trip to Wuhan but were not given access .
