The world is " weeks to months " away from knowing what drugs will work to fight Covid 19 , said Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , the technical lead for the World Health Organization 's coronavirus response . 
The WHO is tracking a number of studies that are trying to determine exactly how many people have been infected around the world , Van Kerkhove said . 
According to one study in Germany , the number of people who have antibodies that show they 've had the coronavirus infection ranges from 2 % or 3 % up to 14 % of the population , she said during CNN 's coronavirus town hall earlier tonight . 
" What ’s interesting about this is that these numbers , this seroprevalence , is a lot lower than some of the earlier models had predicted that would have suggested that this virus was circulating a lot more , and that much more of the population was already infected . " 
Van Kerkhove said . 
" So these studies right now are not actually showing us that . " 
Seroprevalence is the number of people in a population who test positive for a disease . 
The WHO is also closely monitoring the hundreds of Covid 19 drug trials . 
It ’s critical that the studies are done and done well , Van Kerkhove said . 
" So we can get to the answer that everybody needs , " she said . 
The results , she added , " ca not come soon enough . " 
But the world is " weeks to months " from knowing what works .
