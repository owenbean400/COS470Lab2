The World Health Organization said Friday it will keep a close eye on the impact of Covid 19 during pregnancy , as some recent studies point to pregnant women with underlying health conditions being at higher risk of getting severely ill from the virus . 
Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO 's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit , said during a news briefing that pregnant women " do not seem to develop a different type of disease than women of the same age who are not pregnant . " 
In a recent report , the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said pregnant women who get infected with novel coronavirus are more likely to be hospitalized , admitted to an intensive care unit and put on a ventilator . 
While the CDC said the study included the largest cohort of pregnant women with lab confirmed coronavirus , it 's not clear whether the pregnant women who were hospitalized were in the hospital because of complications related to Covid 19 or for pregnancy related reasons . 
" We need to ensure that we keep a close eye on [ this ] and ensure that pregnant women have the right care throughout their pregnancy , " Van Kerkhove said at the briefing .
