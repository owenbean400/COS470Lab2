It is unlikely that the world can eradicate or eliminate coronavirus any time soon , a World Health Organization official said on Friday . 
" We ’ve seen countries who ’ve managed to get to zero or almost zero re import virus from outside . 
So there ’s always a risk — either from within or from bringing disease back in — and therefore , it is a given that there is always a risk of further cases , " Ryan said . 
" The transmission that occurs in that situation can be single , sporadic cases , which can be relatively easily isolated and quarantined . 
A more worrying pattern is large clusters of cases that could occur in association with super spreading events — events in which large crowds gather . " 
Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO 's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit , also said in Friday 's briefing that " this is something we all need to anticipate — that there 's the possibility that there could be a resurgence , there could be these small outbreaks . "
