The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board ( GPMB ) released its annual report Monday , noting that Covid 19 revealed the world ’s " collective failure " to prepare and calling for a renewed commitment to collaboration and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
GPMB is an independent body , convened by the WHO and the World Bank , to ensure preparedness for global health crises . 
In its 2019 report , the board noted that " a rapidly spreading pandemic due to a lethal respiratory pathogen " was a real threat , and that the world was not prepared , financially or structurally . 
Among the lessons learned from Covid 19 , the board notes that a pandemic can wreak havoc on social and economic systems , in addition to health . 
Political leadership matters , the report says , especially when leaders realize that they do not need to choose between protecting people or the economy . 
The board says it ’s worth investing in pandemic preparedness , noting : " It would take 500 years to spend as much on investing in preparedness as the world is losing due to COVID 19 . " 
The board calls for immediate action moving forward , including responsible leadership and ensuring fair access to vaccines . 
" Each country should get an initial allocation of vaccine sufficient to cover at least 2 % of its population , to cover frontline healthcare workers , " the report says . 
The board also calls on ordinary citizens to step up , by holding their governments accountable and taking health precautions to protect one another . 
The report notes that women in particular are bearing the brunt of the pandemic , while remaining inadequately involved in preparedness and response .
