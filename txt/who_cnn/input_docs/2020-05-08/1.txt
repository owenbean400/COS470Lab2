Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program , said the lives of people across the world could face " significant alteration " until a coronavirus vaccine is developed . 
Speaking on Friday during a briefing , Ryan said , " There is a path out , but we must remain ever vigilant . 
And we may have to have a significant alteration to our lifestyles , until we get to a point where we have an effective vaccine , or an effective treatments . " 
Ryan said the team at WHO feels the effects of physical distancing , just like the rest of the world . 
" We have not shaken hands or hugged our friends in 18 weeks either , " he said . 
To reopen , " many countries are taking a very careful stepwise approach , relying on the patience and perseverance of their citizens to continue to suffer what is a difficult process both socially psychologically and economically for many people , " he said . 
" I think everyone is doing that because we want to protect those we love . " 
Ryan sees the path out involving partial school openings , partial returns to workplaces and careful measures in place to those who work in high density areas . 
But for things like concerts and sports , he said , " it 's going to be much more difficult to make those perfectly safe . "
