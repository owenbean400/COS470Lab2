The World Health Organization said efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic need to go back to the basics . 
" We seem also to be avoiding the uncomfortable reality that we need to get back to public health surveillance , " Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program , said on Friday during a briefing . 
" We sometimes look for the answers where they are not . 
We need to go back to the basic principles of how we control this disease , a comprehensive strategy that matches basic public health surveillance . " he added . 
Ryan said there is a lot of other information and science out there , " but we need to stick to the core strategy , or else we really will risk looking for answers , where the answers are not . "
