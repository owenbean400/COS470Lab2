Donald Trump 's decision to pull funding to the World Health Organization will weaken the global effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic and damage all of the world 's countries , including the US itself , China has said . 
Trump announced on Tuesday that he was halting funding to the WHO , pending a review into the agency . 
He had previously accused the organization of being too " China centric . " 
" At present , the global pandemic situation is grim and is at a critical moment , " China 's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Wednesday , adding that Trump 's move would " weaken WHO â€™s abilities and undermine global cooperation on combating the pandemic . " 
" It will affect all countries in the world , including the United States -- especially those with vulnerable abilities , " he said . 
" We urge the US to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations , and support WHO to lead the international combat against the pandemic . " 
Lijian also praised the WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus 's handling of the pandemic , and said the organization has " actively performed its responsibilities and played a central coordination role in promoting international anti pandemic cooperation , which has been widely recognized and highly praised by the international community . " 
The US contributes $ 400 million to $ 500 million to the WHO each year , Trump said while announcing the move , noting that China " contributes roughly $ 40 million . " 
" Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China 's lack of transparency , the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death , " Trump said .
