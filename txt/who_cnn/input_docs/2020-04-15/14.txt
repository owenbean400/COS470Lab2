Amnesty International , a global human rights group , called on the US Congress to stop President Trump ’s plan to halt funding to the World Health Organization amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
Trump on Tuesday announced he was halting funding to WHO while a review is conducted over the agency ’s " role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus . " 
Guevara Rosas said this decision distracts " from criticisms of his own administration 's response " and undermines " global efforts to protect people from one of the worst health crises in over a century . " 
The novel coronavirus does not respect borders , she added , and " President Trump ’s proposal to slash [ WHO ’s ] resources at this moment of crisis will undermine efforts to save lives and halt the spread of the virus . "
