The coronavirus outbreak has reached the " highest level " of risk for the world , the World Health Organization announced today . 
" This thing can go in any direction . 
We ’re not undermining the risk , it ’s there . 
That ’s why today we said the global risk is very high . 
We increased it from high to very high , " Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said during a press briefing in Geneva on Friday . 
Remember : That risk assessment makes no " legal difference " in how countries should prepare for the outbreak , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the WHO ’s Health Emergencies Programme , said during today 's press briefing . 
Rather , " raising the risk to very high is essentially reflecting what ’s actually happening at a global level , " Ryan said , adding that this is a " reality check " for governments to prepare . 
" We are on the highest level of alert , on the highest level of risk assessment in terms of spread and in terms of impact , but that is not in order to alarm or scare people , " Ryan said . 
" We can avoid the worst of this but our level of concern is at its highest . "
