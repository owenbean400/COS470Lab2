World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO epidemiologists have been monitoring developments in global coronavirus cases and " we have now increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of Covid 19 to very high at a global level . " 
Most cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus can still be traced to known contacts or clusters of cases , he said , and WHO does not see evidence as of yet that the virus is spreading freely .
