A top Olympic official told reporters in Tokyo on Friday that the Summer Games remain " on track " despite the outbreak of novel coronavirus . 
Advice from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) indicates that " there ’s no case for any contingency plans of cancelling the Games or moving the Games , " said John Coates , chairman of the Coordination Commission for the Games of the XXXII Olympiad Tokyo . 
Asked by CNN ’s Matt Rivers if he had 100 % confidence that things would move forward smoothly and the Games would go ahead , Coates said , " yes I do . " 
" We continue to monitor particularly the Chinese that will be coming here , " Coates said , adding that " the Chinese team are mostly out of China now – the athletes and officials " for training and qualifying events . 
He said that any Chinese athletes or fans coming from China , particularly affected provinces , would have to adhere to any Japanese government protocols . 
Meetings over the past two days in Tokyo " reinforced our confidence " that the Japanese government is properly addressing the virus , he said . 
" We ’re going to be very reliant on the communications coming from the organizing committee , but also the national government . " 
Yoshiro Mori , president of Tokyo 2020 , said that the Japanese government had set up a headquarters to take " full and thorough measures " to address the outbreak , and " meetings have already been held and we are working to share information . "
