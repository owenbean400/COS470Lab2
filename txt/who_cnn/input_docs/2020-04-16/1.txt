Spain has doubled the number of daily coronavirus tests to 40,000 , resulting in an increase of figures since the start of the pandemic , said Fernando Simón , the country ’s director of health emergencies . 
Even though the total overall number is up because of expanded testing , Simón said , the number of active cases is in decline , at less than 1 % , Spain ’s Health Ministry records show . 
He said this is due " in part to increased testing , including the rapid tests that look for antibodies , and for the even more reliable PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) tests , which look for the virus itself . " 
Simon called the testing an " enormous effort across the nation to locate the virus . " 
Minister of Health Salvador Illa has said he wants to increase testing numbers to 50,000 a day . 
By the numbers : Spain continues to see a " progressive decline in the number of new hospitalized people and new intensive care admissions " Simon said , citing 1,003 new hospital admissions , " a 1.7 % increase with respect to the previous day . " 
Simon said 79 new cases were admitted into intensive care units , ICUs , " a 1.4 % increase with respect to the day before . " 
When asked why the large increase of deaths and infections reported by Catalan regional health authorities late Wednesday were not included in the national count , Simon defended the Spanish Health Ministry ’s figures , saying " we are counting all those infected who die and have a test in which coronavirus is detected . " 
Some context : The Spanish region of Catalonia may have twice the official number of deaths reported so far by the Spanish government , according to new data from the region ’s department of health . 
Spanish government health authorities have repeatedly said their counting methods are in line with international protocols , such as the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the European Center for Disease Control ( ECDC ) .
