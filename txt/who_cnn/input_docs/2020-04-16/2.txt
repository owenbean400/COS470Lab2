The World Health Organization is warning the global public that drinking alcohol does not protect you against Covid 19 or kill the virus , and excessive alcohol consumption can be harmful for your health –– even compromising the body 's immune system . 
WHO officials in a statement on Tuesday called for governments around the world to enforce the measures in place that limit alcohol consumption and to avoid any relaxation of regulations during the coronavirus pandemic . 
For instance , " alcohol is consumed in excessive quantities in the European Region , and leaves too many victims , " Carina Ferreira Borges , program manager for WHO Europe 's alcohol and illicit drugs program , said in the statement . 
WHO 's statement comes at a time when misinformation around Covid 19 continues to circulate online –– including the myth that consuming high strength ethyl alcohol or ethanol can kill the coronavirus . 
WHO said " it does not " and that alcohol , especially if it has been adulterated with methanol , could result in " severe health consequences " or death .
