There are now more than 100,000 cases of coronavirus across Africa , with the virus spreading to every country in the continent , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said on Friday . 
So far , 3,100 people in Africa have died from the virus . 
During a briefing on Friday , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the WHO 's health emergencies program , said , " On the one hand , good news â€” the disease has not taken off in a very fast trajectory , but a concern some countries are accelerating in the number of cases . " 
Ryan warned that within Africa , there are " many , many highly vulnerable groups " and the impact of coronavirus on those groups has yet to be seen . 
" We do not know what the impact of this will be in undernourished children with chronic malnutrition , we do not know what the impact of this will be in in overcrowded refugee camps . 
So , there 's a lot still to be learned , " he said .
