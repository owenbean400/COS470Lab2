Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , an infectious disease epidemiologist with the World Health Organization , called the coronavirus " a controllable virus " tonight at CNN 's town hall . 
Van Kerkhove spent two weeks in China working with Chinese health authorities to better understand what worked to limit the spread of the coronavirus . 
" Fundamental public health actions " worked , she said . 
Washing hands , social distancing , people staying home when they are sick , seeking treatment when necessary and tracing the contacts of the people who have tested positive for the virus are all ways to limit the spread of the disease , Van Kerkhove said . 
" Those lessons can be applied to all countries , " Van Kerkhove said . 
" We are seeing countries demonstrate that they can slow this virus down . "
