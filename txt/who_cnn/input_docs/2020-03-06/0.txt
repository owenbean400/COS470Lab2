Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization , has weighed in to offer advice to the public at CNN 's coronavirus town hall . 
" I want to emphasize for our viewers , we can look to doctors and government officials , but it is each of us , individuals all around the world , who are literally the front lines of this , " she added . 
" It 's washing your hands , not just for yourself , it 's for your fellow family members and fell low citizens . 
Each of us have a responsibility in this . " 
What she said people should be doing : Wash your hands : A basic measure that goes a long way when done properly with soap and water for 20 seconds , and frequently throughout the day . 
If you do not have access to that : Use alcohol gel or hand sanitizer . 
Respiratory etiquette : Sneeze or cough into your elbow or a tissue , and put it in a bin . 
Be informed : Use reliable sources like the WHO or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" Educate yourself , know what you can do , how you can protect yourself , how you can protect your family , " Kerkhove said .
