US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams confirmed during an appearance on Good Morning America today that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is " taking another look " at whether healthy people should wear masks to help prevent the spread of Covid 19 . 
" Initially , the CDC , the World Health Organization and my office recommended against the general public wearing masks based on the best available science at the time in terms of whether or not it prevented the wearer from catching coronavirus , " Adams told ABC ’s Robin Roberts . 
Last month , Adams urged Americans to stop buying masks , tweeting , " They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching # Coronavirus , but if healthcare providers ca not get them to care for sick patients , it puts them and our communities at risk ! " 
But today , Adams health officials have learned more about the virus , which could prompt them to change recommendations . 
He added : " The CDC is looking at whether or not we should be recommending more people wear masks when they go out , " Adams said , adding a final point , " If you ’re going to wear a face covering when you go out , please understand you still do not need a N95 mask and if you take one of those N95 masks you may be taking it out of the hands of a health care worker who desperately needs it to care for patients .
