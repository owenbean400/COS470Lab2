Dr . Mike Ryan , World Health Organization executive director of the health emergencies program , said Wednesday that the Americas have not reached their coronavirus peak . 
Particularly across Central and South America , Ryan said , " We 've seen a steady and worrying continuation of trend — with many countries experiencing between 25 % and 50 % rise in cases over the last week . " 
Ryan added many countries are still " suffering sustained community transmission . " 
Across the region , we will likely see a " sustained number of cases and continued deaths in the coming weeks , " he said . 
Though Ryan said there is no way to predict the numbers , at this point the epidemic is " still intense " across a range of countries . 
" I do not think anybody wants to go back to population wide , society wide lockdowns . 
But the only way , in some circumstances , to avoid that now is a very , very , very aggressive investment in our capacity to detect cases , confirm cases , quarantine contacts , and keep our communities onboard and willing — able without coercion — to support clear messaging and clear instructions and requests from government in a trusting environment , " Ryan said .
