The World Health Organization is urging women who have contracted -- or are suspected of contracting -- coronavirus to continue breastfeeding their babies or young children . 
In a scientific brief released Tuesday , the WHO said the benefits of breastfeeding " substantially outweigh the potential risks for transmission " of the coronavirus . 
How WHO came to its conclusion : The WHO said researchers reviewed studies that included mothers with suspected or confirmed Covid 19 and their babies or young children . 
A total of 153 cases of mothers with the virus were included in the review . 
The breast milk of 46 mothers was tested . 
All had Covid 19 and while 13 infants tested positive for the virus , the researchers were unable to determine conclusively how the babies contracted the virus . 
It was not clear if the breast milk was the source of the infection , or simply close contact with the infected mothers . 
Researchers said other infections that breastfeeding protects against pose a much bigger risk to babies and children than the coronavirus .
