The British government is exploring the possibility of clinical trials in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to coronavirus to test the effectiveness of vaccine candidates , the UK Department for Business , Energy , and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ) revealed Wednesday in a statement . 
In so called " challenge trials , " researchers give study subjects an experimental vaccine and then intentionally expose them to coronavirus to see if the vaccine works . 
Such trials were used in early research with smallpox , yellow fever and malaria . 
However , deliberately infecting study participants poses more risks and raises ethical concerns , compared to randomized controlled trials , where study subjects receive a vaccine or a placebo , and researchers monitor to see if they become ill as they go about their daily lives . 
The World Health Organization issued guidance in May saying challenge studies can be " substantially faster " and more effective than other methods , in part because fewer participants need to be exposed to experimental vaccines and because they can be used to compare potential vaccines . 
It also said controlled infection trials could be ethically acceptable if they met certain criteria . 
These include choosing young and healthy adults as participants , starting with low doses , ensuring public engagement , and providing high quality care and close monitoring . 
But in July , members of the US National Institutes of Health " Accelerating Covid 19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines " ( ACTIV ) Working Group said such trials would not hasten development of a vaccine .
