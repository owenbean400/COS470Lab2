" We need to highlight and support each other in sharing the stories of what has worked , " Van Kerhove added . 
She added that while many people may be " tired " of the pandemic , " we will get throught this . " 
" I think many people — individuals , governments — everyone is tired . 
And seeing resurgence in many places can be very difficult to handle — mentally , physically — but we will get through this , " she said .
