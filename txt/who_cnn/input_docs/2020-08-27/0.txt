The World Health Organization is " alarmed " by the rapid spread of Covid 19 in Libya , the organization said in a statement on Wednesday . 
In the past two weeks alone , the number of confirmed cases in the country has more than doubled , the statement said -- and since there are acute shortages of tests and laboratory capacity , the real number of cases is likely much higher . 
Libya has confirmed nearly 12,000 coronavirus cases , including more than 200 deaths , according to the latest data available from Johns Hopkins University . 
Worsening the problem is the fact that years of conflict in the region have damaged Libya 's healthcare system ; about half of all primary health care facilities are closed , the WHO statement said . 
" We are alarmed at the rapid spread of the virus in the country , " said Elizabeth Hoff , WHO Representative in Libya , in the statement . 
WHO added that it 's working with Libyan authorities and other international organizations like UNICEF to respond to the crisis , launch public awareness campaigns , and stepping up testing efforts .
