The high number of Covid 19 deaths in Africa is linked to patients who also suffered from non communicable diseases ( NCDs ) , such as diabetes and hypertension , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) says . 
WHO says around 50 % of Covid 19 deaths in Kenya and 85 % in the Democratic Republic of Congo were patients with such conditions . 
People with NCDs are more susceptible to contracting severe cases of Covid 19 and yet NCDs remains the most underfunded public health issue , according to Dr Moeti , WHO Regional Director for Africa . 
The issue is also raising mental health concerns among those who are not able to access appropriate care during the pandemic . 
Dr Moeti announced the launch of a network of laboratories to reinforce genome sequencing of the novel coronavirus in Africa WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" As we continue to tackle the Covid 19 pandemic in Africa , being able to not only track its evolution , but also assess the possible mutation of the virus is crucial to mounting an effective response , " said Dr Moeti .
