The coronavirus outbreak has turned a spotlight on the science of disease , raising the question : What exactly is a pandemic ? 
An outbreak is the occurrence of disease cases in excess of what 's normally expected , according to the World Health Organization . 
An epidemic is more than a normal number of cases of an illness , specific health related behavior or other health related events in a community or region . 
A pandemic is defined as the " worldwide spread " of a new disease . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said earlier this month that there is no actual scientific , definitive definition of what constitutes a pandemic . 
He added that there could be arguments on either side as to whether the coronavirus outbreak could be described as a pandemic . 
What the WHO says : In general , the WHO avoids declaring public health situations that are not flu pandemics as pandemics .
