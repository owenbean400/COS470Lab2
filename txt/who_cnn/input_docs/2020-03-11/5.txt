" The new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting Covid 19 cases , " the World Health Organization says . 
" Even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days ( depending on the type of surface ) , it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved , travelled , and exposed to different conditions and temperatures , " WHO said .

After touching it , clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . "
