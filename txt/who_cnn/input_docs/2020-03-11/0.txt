The World Health Organization just declared the novel coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic . 
The novel coronavirus outbreak is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday . 
" Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO â€™s assessment of the threat posed by this coronavirus . 
It does not change what WHO is doing , and it does not change what countries should do , " he added . 
Remember : CNN began calling the virus a pandemic earlier this week . 
The specific criteria for a pandemic are not universally defined , but there are three general criteria : a virus that can cause illness or death ; sustained person to person transmission of that virus ; and evidence of spread throughout the world .
