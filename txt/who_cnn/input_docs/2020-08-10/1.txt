Covid 19 is brutal in its simplicity and its cruelty , but there are things that can be done to outsmart it , according to World Health Organization officials . 
" When we talk about what is the virus trying to do and the virus being an enemy , the virus does not have a brain . 
We ’re the ones with the brains , " said Dr . Mike Ryan , director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Programme , during a news conference in Geneva on Monday . 
Ryan described the virus as a simple biologic entity that can enter a human cell and instruct that cell to make more viruses , which can at minimum infect someone else ; or in the worst case , kill the person . 
Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO ’s technical lead for coronavirus , elaborated on how this can be done , saying that the goal of the virus is to reproduce , find individuals to pass between but not kill too many , as it Is unable to pass to another person if it kills its host . 
" There ’s many , many things that we can do right now with the tools that we have right now , to outsmart this virus , " she said . 
While work on therapeutics and vaccines will continue , at this point chains of transmission can be broken , she said . 
These include social distancing , contact tracing , quarantining infected individuals , the use of masks when physical distancing is not possible , and hand washing . 
" If we do all of these things , we can outsmart the virus , and we can prevent this virus from passing from one individual to another , " she said , adding that everyone on the planet needs to understand that they have a role to play in breaking chain of transmission .
