The US Food and Drug Administration will not compromise on the safety of a Covid 19 vaccine , even with the speed with which it must evaluate vaccine candidates , FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn told American Medical Association President Dr . Susan Bailey in an online conversation Monday . 
Hahn acknowledged that because of the speed with which the agency is working , some experts have questioned if the FDA will compromise its scientific principles in reviewing clinical trial data . 
Hahn asked the doctors listening to the conversation to urge patients to take the vaccine once it is approved . 
He said that he has seen surveys that report a significant part of the public will be reluctant to get a Covid 19 vaccine . 
A CNN poll in May found one third of Americans said they would not try to get vaccinated against Covid 19 , even if the vaccine is widely available and low cost . 
" We hope that you will urge your patients to take an approved vaccine , so that we can seek to establish widespread immunity , " Hahn said . 
More context : There are 26 vaccines in human trials around the world with four in the United States . 
There are also 139 in preclinical trials around the world , according to the World Health Organization .
