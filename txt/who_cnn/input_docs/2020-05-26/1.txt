Three months ago , as the novel coronavirus began to gain a foothold in countries across Europe , officials in the UK said they were still confident that the risk to the British public remained low . 
By February 25 , the World Health Organization said the virus had already killed thousands in China and was spreading through northern Italy , but at the time there were just 13 confirmed cases -- and no deaths -- in the UK . 
While the government ordered hospitals to prepare for an influx of patients , its advice to some of the country 's most vulnerable people -- elderly residents of care or nursing homes -- was that they were " very unlikely " to be infected . 
That guidance would remain in place over the next two and a half weeks , as the number of coronavirus cases in the UK exploded . 
By the time the advice was withdrawn on March 13 and replaced with new guidance , there were 594 confirmed cases , and it was too late . 
By May 1 , of the 33,365 total confirmed deaths in England and Wales , at least 12,526 -- or 38 % -- were care home residents , according to the latest estimates from the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) . 
While the UK government has defended its handling of the issue , care home staff and experts placed at least some of the blame for Europe 's highest death toll on the prioritization of hospitals over these facilities . 
Others have blamed the slow rollout of testing , the government 's alleged pursuit of " herd immunity " ( which it denies seeking ) and its failure to order a lockdown early enough .

Many other nations were slow to respond to the threat at care home facilities , and the consequences have been devastating .
