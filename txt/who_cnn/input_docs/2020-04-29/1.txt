The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said it is aware of the United Kingdom report about a small number of children with the inflammatory response to Covid 19 . 
On Wednesday , Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO technical lead for the coronavirus response said , " We 're looking at this with our clinical network , and in fact our clinical network had a teleconference yesterday which discussed this . " 
" There are some recent rare descriptions of children in some European countries that have had this inflammatory syndrome , which is similar to the Kawasaki Syndrome , but it seems to be very rare , " Van Kerkhove said . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the WHO â€™s health emergencies program , said clinicians are looking into what is " causing the inflammation that attacks tissue , other than lung tissue . " 
" We 've seen this in the past with many emerging diseases . 
They do not necessarily only attack one type of tissue ; there can be multiple organs affected and many of you have seen the reports of other organs that have been affected with this disease , " Ryan said .
