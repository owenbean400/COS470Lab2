The cruise industry is " focused on protecting the health and safety of passengers and crew " amid the coronavirus outbreak , according to the industry ’s largest trade group . 
" The enhanced screening measures , the first of which were adopted within hours of the WHO declaring a global health emergency , do appear to be working and have enabled operations to continue as usual in many parts of the world , " said Bari Goin Blaugrund , senior director of strategic communications of Cruise Lines International Association , or CLIA . 
Goin Blaugrund also said that within the global CLIA fleet of 272 cruise ships , only one has experienced any cases of coronavirus on board . 
Passengers aboard that ship , the Diamond Princess in Japan , began disembarking Wednesday after a 14 day quarantine . 
A total of 624 cases of the virus are linked to the stricken ship . 
Analysts say the coronavirus could take a financial toll on the industry , especially in China . 
If operators cancel cruises through March , JP Morgan predicts revenue could fall as much at 15 % . 
Shares for two of the biggest cruise operators — Royal Caribbean and Carnival — are down more than 16 % and 14 % this year , respectively .
