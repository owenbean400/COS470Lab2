With many questions still remaining around the rapidly spreading coronavirus , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Tuesday for open sharing of research on the virus . 
" We hope that every country that has information , this includes China , will be completely open and transparent . 
It took us too long to get the medical experts into country , " Pompeo said at a joint news conference in Addis Ababa . 
The World Health Organization has praised the Chinese government for its actions to contain the epidemic but the US and China have at times clashed over how best to deal with the coronavirus . 
Speaking Tuesday , Pompeo said that the outbreak was now a problem " of global scale . " 
" We wish that ( information sharing ) could have happened more quickly . 
But we are hopeful that the Chinese government will increase its transparency , " he said .
