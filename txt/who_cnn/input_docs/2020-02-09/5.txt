More than 810 people have now died of the pneumonia like novel coronavirus , making it more deadly than the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak between 2002 and 2003 . 
But while it may have killed more people , the death rate of the novel coronavirus is much lower than SARS . 
According to the World Health Organization , the death rate for the SARS epidemic was 9.6 % -- so for every 10 people who got it , on average one would die . 
In comparison , the death rate for the coronavirus so far has appeared to be much lower . 
On current numbers , the death rate appears to be at 2.2 % globally , less than a quarter of SARS . 
However , the coronavirus also appears to be more contagious than SARS . 
While in total , SARS only had just over 8,000 confirmed cases , the current virus has already infected more than 37,000 people across the world .
