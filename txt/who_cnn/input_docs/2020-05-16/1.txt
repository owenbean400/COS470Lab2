The World Health Organization ( WHO ) on Friday released a scientific brief on the multisystem inflammatory syndrome seen in some children and teens with Covid 19 . 
The brief described how clusters of children with the condition have emerged in Europe and North America , but an " urgent need " remains to collect additional data on the syndrome 's clinical presentations , severity , outcomes and epidemiology . 
The brief also provided a preliminary case of definition for the condition , noting that it is typically seen in children up to 19 years old who have a fever for at least three days and who have some symptoms including rash , hypotension or shock , myocardial dysfunction , diarrhea , vomiting or elevated markers of inflammation . 
The brief also notes that cases would have no other microbial causes of inflammation , such as a bacterial infection , and that there would be evidence of Covid 19 or contact with someone with Covid 19 . 
WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on clinicians worldwide to " be on the alert and better understand this syndrome in children , " in a post on Twitter on Saturday , which shared a link to the scientific brief .
