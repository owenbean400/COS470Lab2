Public trust around coronavirus vaccines is dropping quickly , according to Dr . Seema Yasmin , a former CDC disease detective , who is tracking this in real time . 
" I have concerns about how the trials for vaccines are being communicated , " she said about her observations from her work on misinformation and disinformation particularly around vaccines . 
In a recent interview , Dr . Anthony Fauci said a Covid 19 vaccine could be available earlier than expected if ongoing clinical trials produce overwhelmingly positive results . 
Dr . Yasmin agrees , however , she points out that it will not lead to widespread usage if there is no public trust . 
" My concern is that dropping credibility in science and scientists , in the FDA , which already this year has fast tracked two emergency use authorizations and very questionably , " she added . 
Some background : Three Covid 19 vaccine candidates are in large scale US trials . 
British drugmaker Astra Zeneca said Monday it has started Phase 3 trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine in the US , becoming the third company to start late stage trials of a vaccine to prevent Covid 19 . 
The vaccine , developed in partnership with Oxford University , has the backing of the US federal government . 
Rivals Moderna and Pfizer/Bio NTec already have Phase 3 trials under way , also with federal government funding . 
The World Health Organization cautioned countries Monday against rushing to develop coronavirus vaccines and advised taking great care in granting emergency use authorization â€” a quicker route to getting a vaccine in wide use than full approval , which can take many months .
