Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said countries allowing the coronavirus to go " unchecked " are playing with fire . 
Tedros did not name any particular country , but said there will be further needless deaths and suffering , and there are a significant number of people who are experiencing long term effects of the virus . 
Health workers are facing extreme mental health pressure and cases are burdening health systems severely in too many countries , Tedros said . 
He said that health workers went into medicine to save lives , and they must not be put in a position where they have to make impossible choices about who to care for . 
" We need to do everything we can to support health workers , keep schools open , protect the vulnerable and safeguard the economy , " Tedros said . 
" There is no excuse for inaction . 
My message is very clear : act fast , act now , act decisively , " Tedros said . 
" A laissez faire attitude to the virus -- not using the full range of tools available -- leads to death , suffering and hurts livelihoods and economies . "
