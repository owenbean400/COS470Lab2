More than half of refugees and migrants surveyed reported increased " depression , anxiety , and loneliness " caused by Covid 19 , according to a survey from the World Health Organization that was put out on Friday . 
In addition , one in five refugees and migrants surveyed reported increased drug and alcohol use . 
The survey , compiled in a report titled Apart Together , was conducted by the WHO and a research consortium led by Ghent University and the University of Copenhagen . 
The survey accessed 30,000 migrants and refugees in almost every WHO member state . 
Refugees and migrants reported high compliance rates with some measures of virus prevention , like hand washing and wearing face coverings . 
However , nearly 20 % said they were unable to comply with stay at home measures , and more than 15 % were unable to avoid public transport . 
Twelve percent of those surveyed reported current symptoms they believed to be linked to Covid 19 . 
Of those who reported being unable to access medical care if they had symptoms , 35 % said they lacked the money to seek health care and 22 % said they feared deportation if they accessed medical care . 
" Access to care must not be linked to legal status , " WHO Director General Dr . Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing discussing the report ’s findings . 
" We call on all countries to remove financial and other barriers to care for migrants as part of their journey towards universal health coverage . 
Health for all means all – including migrants . "
