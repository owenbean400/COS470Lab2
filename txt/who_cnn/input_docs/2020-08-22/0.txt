An expert adviser to the UK government on the pandemic has warned that the coronavirus could remain active on a global scale indefinitely , adding that the world may need to undergo several rounds of vaccinations . 
" [ It ] almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations so , a bit like flu , people will need re vaccination at regular intervals . " 
Pressed on whether he agrees with projections from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , who said Friday that he hoped the pandemic would be over in under two years , Walport told the BBC that tackling the virus will depend on a successful vaccine . 
The government adviser also cautioned that the percentage of new cases in the UK is rising in some parts of the country , warning that " much more draconian measures " may need to be enforced if there is a significant rise in the infection rate . 
" Is there a situation where it could get out of control ? 
Well , obviously , that is possible and that is why it is so important that we all work together , " Walport said . 
" This infection is with us . 
We know that less than one in five people around the country have been infected , so 80 % of the population are still susceptible to the virus . "
