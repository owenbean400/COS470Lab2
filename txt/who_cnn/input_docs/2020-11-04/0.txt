As of November 1 , there have been 46 million coronavirus cases and 1.2 million deaths globally , according to the World Health Organization â€™s weekly Covid 19 update . 
An age and gender analysis shows younger people account for more coronavirus cases over the course of the pandemic , with the proportion of cases among 15 - to 24 year olds increasing from 4 % in the beginning stages of the pandemic to 14 % more recently , and from 50 % to 65 % among 25 - to 64 year olds . 
Among those 65 and older , the proportion of cases decreased from 40 % to 15 % . 
The WHO also notes increasing reports of long term effects of coronavirus , including among younger people . 
While the trend in cases is shifting among age groups , older people remain the most vulnerable to illness and death from Covid 19 .
