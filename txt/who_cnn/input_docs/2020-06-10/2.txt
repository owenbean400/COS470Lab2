The US government will fund and conduct key studies on three experimental coronavirus vaccines – those developed by Moderna , Oxford University/Astra Zeneca , and Johnson & Johnson , Dr . Anthony Fauci confirmed to CNN . 
Phase three trials , which typically involve tens of thousands of people and measure whether a vaccine is safe and effective , will begin with Moderna in July , then Oxford/Astra Zeneca in August and Johnson & Johnson in September . 
The funding and trial timing were first reported by the Wall Street Journal . 
Each phase three trial is expected to take place at more than 50 sites , mostly in the United States , but possibly in other countries , too . 
The trials , which are expected to include about 30,000 people , will begin only after there ’s enough evidence of safety and efficacy from earlier trial stages . 
The US government might also plan phase three trials for additional coronavirus vaccines currently in development . 
According to the World Health Organization , there are 10 vaccines currently in human trials and 126 more in development .
