Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious diseases expert , said the World Health Organization " was not correct " in suggesting Covid 19 transmission from an asymptomatic person to an uninfected person is very rare . 
Speaking on ABC 's " Good Morning America , Fauci weighed in on the comments from a WHO official who suggested asymptomatic people only rarely spread Covid 19 , contradicting guidance from public health organizations , including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
WHO tried to clarify the remarks the next day by saying asymptomatic spread is " a major unknown . " 
" And we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they 're without symptoms . 
So to make a statement , to say that 's a rare event , was not correct , " Fauci told ABC 's Robin Roberts .
