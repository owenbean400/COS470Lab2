National Institutes of Health Director Dr . Francis Collins told CNN that when the world eventually gets a coronavirus vaccine , it might require two doses to be fully effective . 
" Obviously that â€™s not our favorite . 
It would be much better if this could all be done with a single injection , " Collins said . 
Generally , with any vaccine , one dose is preferred for cost reasons , and also because people are less likely to show up twice to receive an injection . 
Collins said the large scale clinical trials of several experimental vaccines , expected to start next month , will reveal whether one or two doses will be necessary . 
The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) , a part of the Department of Health and Human Services , is currently funding research on five different experimental vaccines . 
Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Astra Zeneca are currently in clinical trials , testing the vaccines on humans . 
Johnson & Johnson , Sanofi , and Merck are developing a vaccine , but have not yet started clinical trials , according to the World Health Organization .
