National Institutes of Health Director Dr . Francis Collins said 100 million doses of coronavirus could " perhaps " be available by early next year . 
Asked when a coronavirus vaccine would be approved and available to the public , Collins said we could " perhaps have , if all goes well , maybe as many as 100 million doses by early 2021 . " 
That â€™s somewhat less optimistic than what Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Wednesday . 
Some context : The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , a part of the Department of Health and Human Services , is currently funding research on five different experimental vaccines . 
Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Astra Zeneca are currently in clinical trials , testing the vaccines on humans . 
Johnson & Johnson , Sanofi , and Merck are developing a vaccine , but have not yet started clinical trials , according to the World Health Organization . 
He said that large scale clinical trials of " several " vaccines will start in July . 
He said each vaccine would be testing in a phase three trial involving 30,000 people , some of them receiving a vaccine and some receiving a placebo , or a shot that does nothing . 
The study subjects will then go about their lives , and the researchers will tally up who contracts Covid 19 and who does not .
