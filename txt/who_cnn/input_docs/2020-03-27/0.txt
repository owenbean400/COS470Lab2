A study published earlier this month suggested that the coronavirus could linger in aerosols -- the suspension of tiny particles or droplets in the air -- for up to three hours . 
But this experiment does not reflect the situation in the real world , and so does not offer any evidence of airborne transmission , said the World Health Organization in its daily coronavirus report on Thursday . 
The findings " do not bring new evidence on airborne transmission " since it was already known that particles that contain the virus could spread during medical procedures that generate aerosols , WHO said . 
Here 's what we do know about how the virus spreads . 
The WHO said evidence shows that the coronavirus transmits through close contact with respiratory droplets , like when someone coughs . 
It is also transmitted by fomites , meaning materials that have been contaminated with droplets of the coronavirus . 
It spreads directly between people when coronavirus droplets reach the nose , mouth or eyes of an uninfected person . 
Since the droplets are too heavy to be airborne , they land on objects around that person . 
People can become infected by touching those contaminated objects and then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 
So is it airborne ? 
Not that we know of --- the one way airborne transmission may occur is through aerosol generating procedures used to help patients with coronavirus , said the WHO . 
It recommends health care workers wear medical masks for the regular care of patients and respirators for aerosol generating procedures .
