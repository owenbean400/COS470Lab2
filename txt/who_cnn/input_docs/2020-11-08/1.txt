Reports about a strain of coronavirus infecting mink in Denmark are " concerning , " but more studies are needed to determine if the strain is more dangerous in any way , the World Health Organization has said . 
While major mutations can affect the efficacy of vaccines and treatments , the WHO said scientists have not yet noted changes to the mink related strain that affect how well the virus transmits , the severity of disease or the risk of reinfection in people . 
At least 214 cases of Covid 19 have been linked with farmed minks in Denmark since June , the agency said . 
The WHO noted that the minks were infected following human exposure . 
The animals can act as a reservoir , " passing the virus between them , and pose a risk for virus spill over from mink to humans . " 
" WHO advises all countries to enhance surveillance for Covid 19 at the animal human interface where susceptible animal reservoirs are identified , including mink farms , " it added .
