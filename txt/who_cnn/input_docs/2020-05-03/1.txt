Almost everyone knows the lyrics to Queen 's " We Are the Champions . " 
Now , the band has turned the song on its head , as a tribute to workers on the frontline fighting coronavirus . 
Brian May , Roger Taylor and Adam Lambert teamed up to release " You Are The Champions " on Thursday , in a new version of the classic song . 
All proceeds made from the song will go towards the Covid 19 Solidarity Response Fund for The World Health Organization . 
Queen and Lambert were scheduled to be on the European leg of their Rhapsody tour , but the ongoing pandemic led the musicians to postpone the dates . 
This song , though , was recorded while May , Taylor and Lambert were all self isolating in separate cities .
