By the end of 2021 , the World Health Organization plans to deliver about 2 billion doses of a coronavirus vaccine to people across the globe , WHO officials announced during a virtual media briefing on Friday . 
One billion of those doses will be purchased for low - and middle income countries , according to WHO . 
This new goal is part of WHO 's Access to Covid 19 Tools Accelerator program , which launched in April to bring together governments , health groups , scientists , businesses and philanthropists to support efforts to end the coronavirus pandemic . 
The program has four pillars focused on Covid 19 tests , treatments , vaccines and health systems . 
WHO chief scientist Dr . Soumya Swaminathan said during Friday 's briefing that " the only way to prevent further spread and transmission " of the coronavirus would be to have an effective and safe vaccine . 
" The principle of equitable access is a simple thing to say , but a complicated thing to implement . 
It requires active collaboration between governments , industry , health organizations , civil society organizations and communities , " WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during Friday 's briefing . 
" Vaccines , diagnostics and therapeutics are vital tools â€” but to be truly effective , they must be administered with another essential ingredient , which is solidarity . " 
According to WHO , the ACT Accelerator initiative 's plans to deliver tests , therapeutics and a vaccine all over the world are estimated to cost about $ 31.3 billion in funding , of which $ 3.4 billion has so far been pledged .
