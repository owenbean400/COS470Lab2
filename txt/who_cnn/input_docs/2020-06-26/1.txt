Germany and France have pledged hundreds of millions in extra funding for the World Health Organization ( WHO ) just weeks after Donald Trump announced the US would terminate its relationship with the body . 
German Health Minister Jens Spahn announced at a press conference in Geneva on Thursday that his government was set to provide an extra € 266 million ( $ 298 million ) in funding to the WHO . 
" We ... are supporting WHO with an additional € 41 million for its core mandate until 2023 , " Spahn said Thursday . 
" Additional to this we are providing [ an ] additional € 25 million for the implementation for the strategic preparedness response plan . " 
" And due to the still remaining major funding gap to implement the strategic preparedness response plan until the end of this year , the German government has decided to provide [ an ] additional € 200 million to the WHO on top of the € 110 million ... which we have already pledged . " 
Spahn said the funding had not been approved by the German parliament but added that the government was " very confident " it would be approved . 
Germany will also provide medical masks and equipment , including ventilators , for countries in need . 
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter that the organization was " very grateful " for the country 's pledge . 
" All this with the previous pledge of € 110M brings [ Germany 's ] contribution to € 500 million in 2020 , its highest ever in a year , " he said . 
France will give € 90 million to a WHO center , a further € 50 million towards the WHO 's coronavirus response effort and € 100 million worth of masks . 
The funding effort comes after President Trump said he would end the US ' relationship with the international health organization on May 29 . 
The US was previously by far the agency 's largest donor ; in the two year funding cycle of 2018 to 2019 , it gave $ 893 million to WHO .
