Millions of people could die if the coronavirus pandemic sees a second wave of infections , a World Health Organization official warned Friday , adding that the deadly outbreak has so far unfolded much like officials at WHO had anticipated . 
" The comparison is with the Spanish Flu , which behaved exactly like Covid : it went down in the summer and fiercely resumed in September and October , creating 50 million deaths during the second wave , " Dr Ranieri Guerra , WHO assistant director general for strategic initiatives told Italy ’s Rai TV . 
Guerra ’s remarks come as several countries in Europe – and across the globe – begin to relax national confinement measures , originally introduced to limit the spread of coronavirus . 
EU officials today are set to decide which countries will be subject to travel restrictions after countries reopen their borders to international travel . 
With high rates of infection and mortality still being recorded in the US and parts of South America , it is expected that visitors from the region may still be subjected to travel restrictions in Europe .
