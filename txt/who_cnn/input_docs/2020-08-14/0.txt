The World Health Organization is signaling the importance of accessing internationally controlled medicines , such as sedatives and analgesics , for non Covid 19 patients . 
In a joint statement with The International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , WHO said even during a global pandemic , " Non Covid patients continue to require controlled medicines for the management of pain and palliative care , surgical care and anesthesia , mental health and neurological conditions , and for the treatment of drug use disorders . " 
WHO said even before Covid 19 , " patients faced barriers to accessing controlled medicines . " 
Now the problem is exacerbated : " The Covid 19 pandemic has further resulted in interruptions of the medicines supply chain , and it is critical that access to essential health services and medications not be forgotten or de prioritised during this pandemic . " 
The statement urges countries to take advantage of the " simplified control procedures " which were put in place during the pandemic , to export , transport and supply the drugs . 
WHO also lays out published toolkits and guidelines to help countries acquire the drugs .
