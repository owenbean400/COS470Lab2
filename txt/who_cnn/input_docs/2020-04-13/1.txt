Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization ’s health emergencies program , said as the world considers getting back to normal , it ’s important to remember that " masks are not an alternative to lockdown . " 
Ryan continued : " Everything we do in public health or in health and policy affects something else . 
So the pressures on people to go back to work are going to be very strong and very appropriate , but we do not want people having to make difficult choices — and in some ways think that putting a mask on — is the same as staying home and reporting the fact that you 're sick to authorities . " 
" There 's huge pressure on people to go back to work to go back to school to participate in daily life . 
I do not want to be the person at home with a fever , and with a job to go to where I can make a calculation that instead of picking up the phone and phoning my health provider or phoning the public health authorities and asking for a test and a diagnosis that I think that putting a mask on , is an adequate response to that situation . 
And that is something we really have to be careful about , " Ryan added .
