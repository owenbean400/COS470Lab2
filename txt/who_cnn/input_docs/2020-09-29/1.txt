Americans over the age of 30 have been drinking more during the coronavirus pandemic compared to this time last year , and there could be consequences to their physical and mental health , researchers reported Tuesday . 
Overall frequency of alcohol consumption increased by about 14 % from 2019 , the researchers reported in the journal JAMA Network Open . 
That increase averages out to about one additional drinking day per month by 75 % of adults . 
RAND Corporation sociologist Michael Pollard and colleagues analyzed a nationally representative sample of 1,540 people ages 30 to 80 . 
The participants completed a survey about their drinking habits between April 29 and June 9 of 2019 and then again between May 28 and June 16 of this year . 
The volunteers reported they drank alcohol on more days every week . 
They also reported increases in the number of drinks they had ; the number of heavy drinking days ; and the number of alcohol related problems over the last 30 days between 2019 and 2020 . 
Frequency of drinking increased by 17 % among women , 19 % among people ages 30 to 59 and by 10 % among White people . 
" At times of lockdown during the COVID 19 pandemic , alcohol consumption can exacerbate health vulnerability , risk taking behaviors , mental health issues and violence , " the World Health Organization said in April . 
The researchers say it â€™s important to watch for whether the increases in alcohol consumption persist over the pandemic , and whether there will be physical and mental health consequences as a result .
