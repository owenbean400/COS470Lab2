There 's still a lot we do not know about the novel coronavirus , officially called Covid 19 , and scientists around the world are racing to gather data and develop a treatment . 
Here 's what we can tell you so far : Is there a cure ? 
There 's no cure , but patients can be treated for symptoms and may recover . 
The US National Institutes of Health said it 's also working on a vaccine -- but it would take months for clinical trials to begin and more than a year until a vaccine might be available . 
What are the symptoms ? 
Coronavirus symptoms can look like the flu -- a runny nose , cough , sore throat , headache and maybe a fever . 
" It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties , " the World Health Organization says . 
How does the virus spread ? 
The virus is thought to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing . 
There 's also a possibility the virus can exist in and spread through contaminated fecal matter . 
There 's currently no evidence that the virus is airborne -- meaning , for instance , it does not travel across a large room . 
Who is at risk of infection ? 
People of all ages can be infected with the virus , but older people and those with pre existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable to severe complications . 
How can I protect myself ? 
Take the same precautionary measures you would during flu season . 
Wash your hands often with soap and water , cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough , avoid close contact with people or large gatherings , and wear a face mask .
