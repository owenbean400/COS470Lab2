Dr . Michael Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization ’s Health Emergencies Programme , said the organization is still not classifying the coronavirus outbreak a " pandemic . " 
" I think we need to be extremely cautious in using the term ‘ pandemic . ’ 
We had lots of controversies during the H1N1 situation , around when it was pandemic and when it was not pandemic , and I think we need to be careful , " Ryan said yesterday . 
Ryan continued : Dr . Sylvie Briand , director of WHO 's Infectious Hazards Management Department , agreed on the need to be cautious with wording . 
" The difficulty with certain words is that their interpretation varies , and for [ the ] general public , very often ‘ pandemic ’ is really the worst case scenario , " Briand said . 
" And so I think we need , before qualifying the event as the worst case scenario , we need a lot more evidence and a lot more data . 
And so that ’s why I think we need to be cautious , because it can really create panic unnecessarily . "
