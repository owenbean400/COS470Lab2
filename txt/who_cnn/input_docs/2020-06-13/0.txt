Florida researchers say experiments have shown the coronavirus has mutated in a way that makes it infect human cells more easily . 
Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute said the mutation affects the spike protein – a structure on the outside of the virus that it uses to get into cells . 
If the findings are confirmed , it would the first time someone has demonstrated the virus has changed in a significant way . 
" Viruses with this mutation were much more infectious than those without the mutation in the cell culture system we used , " Scripps Research virologist Hyeryun Choe , who helped lead the study , said in a statement . 
Choe and colleagues ran a series of experiments in lab dishes that show a mutation called D614G gives the virus many more spikes , which in turn make it easier for it to get into cells . 
They ’ve published their findings on a preprint server called Bio Rxiv – that means the work has not been reviewed by other experts in the field . 
They said more research is needed to show whether this changes how the virus infects people , and whether the change has affected the course of the pandemic . 
Just this week , the World Health Organization said coronavirus mutations seen so far had not made it more easily transmissible , nor had they made it more likely to cause serious illness .
