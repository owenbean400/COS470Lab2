Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , the technical lead for coronavirus response at the World Health Organization , has warned the virus is resurging in several parts of the world . 
Speaking during CNN 's ongoing town hall tonight , she said places that have seen some success in suppressing transmission are now experiencing a second wave of infection , pointing to South Korea , Singapore , and Wuhan -- the Chinese city at ground zero for the pandemic . 
There are different reasons we 're seeing a resurgence of the virus in these places , she said ; in South Korea , a new cluster in Seoul is linked to nightclubs , while Singapore 's outbreak is largely concentrated within migrant worker dormitories . 
" But what is really important is that in China , in Korea , in Singapore , they have systems in place to rapidly identify the virus again and rapidly start their contact tracing , " Van Kerkhove said . 
The US risks a second wave if it rushes into reopening : Though infection rates are slowing in the United States , individual states should conduct a thorough assessment before reopening , Van Kerkhove said . 
" What is the risk of resurgence ? 
Do we actually have this under control ? 
Are we looking hard enough ? 
Do we have surveillance in place ? 
Do we have contact tracers in place ? 
Do we have hospital beds ? 
If the answer is no , then you need to really consider , are we ready to open this up ? " she said .
