A newly identified condition called multi system inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS C ) is " a bit of a confused picture " right now , Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) technical lead on Covid 19 , said Friday . 
Van Kerkhove said WHO has put out a case definition , describing what symptoms may look like . 
" We need to have clinicians use this case definition to determine how many children fit that definition , and then we need specific data collected from each of those patients , " she said at a news briefing . 
It ’s not clear if the syndrome is what ’s called a post viral syndrome , or a direct result of infection , said Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Program . 
" What we do not know yet is whether those rare things that happen are associated directly with the virus — and the virus directly attacking the cells and those organs — or is what we are seeing also the result of the immune response to the virus ? " he said . 
Ryan likened this to what happens with the Ebola virus and bleeding : " It 's not the virus that causes the bleeding . it 's very often the immune response to the presence of the virus that depletes the capacity of the blood to clot . 
So when a person bleeds , the bleeding continues , " Ryan said . 
Ryan also said as the number of global coronavirus cases grows , " you start to potentially notice much more rarer syndromes . "
