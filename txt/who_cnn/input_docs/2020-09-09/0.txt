Preventable deaths in children under 5 were at the lowest number on record in 2019 , according to a new report by United Nations agencies and the World Bank , released on Tuesday . 
They found that there were just over 5 million preventable deaths last year , down from 12.5 million in 1990 . 
But the coronavirus pandemic is threatening to undermine those gains made in reducing deaths among children and young adolescents . 
The report on mortality estimates comes from UNICEF , the World Health Organization , the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the World Bank Group .
