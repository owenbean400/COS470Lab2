The World Health Organization called a coronavirus cluster of more than 100 cases in Beijing a " significant event . " 
Speaking during a news briefing on Monday , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the WHO ’s Health Emergencies Program , said , " In China , when you spend over 50 days without having any significant local transmission the cluster like this is a concern , and it needs to be investigated and controlled . " 
" We 're always concerned for clusters , " said Maria Van Kerkhove , a WHO infectious disease epidemiologist . 
Van Kerkhove said every single case needs to be addressed , " but clusters are a special condition , because in any country we need to understand why is there the clustering ? " 
Ryan said now is the time to investigate what ’s driving the new infections .
