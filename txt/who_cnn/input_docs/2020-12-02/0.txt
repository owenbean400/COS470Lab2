The World Health Organization updated its guidelines on wearing face masks , recommending that people 12 years and older who are living in areas where Covid 19 is spreading should wear masks in indoor or outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least 3 feet cannot be maintained . 
WHO also recommends that a mask should be worn when people visit your home if there 's not adequate ventilation , or the ability to keep a distance of 3 feet or more . 
Additionally , WHO suggests that people with higher risk of severe complications from the virus should wear medical masks when physical distancing of at least 3 feet cannot be maintained . 
They also advised " universal " wearing of medical masks in health care facilities , including when caring for other patients , as well as with visitors and when congregating in common areas such as cafeterias and staff rooms . 
For children , however , WHO advises that children up to age 5 should not wear masks for source control , and for children ages 6 to 11 , a risk based approach should be applied to the decision to use a mask . 
As for the use of non medical masks , WHO says homemade fabric masks should have a three layer structure ( based on the fabric used ) , while factory made fabric masks should meet the minimum thresholds related to three essential parameters : filtration , breathability and fit . 
Exhalation valves are discouraged because they bypass the filtration function of the fabric mask , rendering it unserviceable for source control . 
WHO also added that people doing vigorous physical activity should not wear masks , citing some associated risks , particularly for people with asthma .
