Governments are failing to keep accurate records of infections and deaths of nurses and health care workers treating coronavirus patients , the International Council of Nurses ( ICN ) , a federation representing nurses from 130 countries , claimed . 
As a result , the numbers are being " significantly " underestimated , the ICN said Monday . 
Data collected by the ICN from 30 countries suggests at least 90,000 health care workers have been infected and more than 260 nurses have died . 
ICN said this failure to record both infection rates and deaths among health care workers is putting more nurses and their patients in danger . 
It is calling for data on health care worker infections and deaths to be systematically collected by national governments and held centrally at the World Health Organization .
