Former British prime minister Theresa May has criticized world leaders for their " inability to forge a coherent international response " to the novel coronavirus pandemic , in an opinion piece for the Times of London on Wednesday . 
May , who was prime minister from 2016 until the summer of 2019 , said that though researchers and scientists across the world are working together , there is " little evidence of politicians doing so . " 
While acknowledging there are " real questions " about the initial response of the Chinese government , May said it would be a " mistake " to " allow this to become a fault line in international relations . " 
Amid ongoing questions of the World Health Organization and the US withdrawal in funding , May said frustrations should be " channeled into reforming " the organisation and " not denigrating the concept of international co operation . " 
This comes as the UK struggles to contain the virus . 
Yesterday the UK 's death toll surpassed Italy 's , making it the highest in Europe and second globally after the US .
