At CNN 's ongoing coronavirus town hall , a viewer asked : How many people worldwide have recovered from the coronavirus ? 
The quick answer is , at least 60,000 , said Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) -- citing a figure from earlier in the week . 
It has since risen ; 
China 's National Health Commission said yesterday that 62,793 patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital . 
Here 's a more detailed breakdown : There are more than 125,000 cases globally , according to the WHO . 
About 80 % of all patients in China had a " mild form of the disease , " said Van Kerkhove -- meaning they may feel unwell for a week or two . 
About 20 % will require advanced care in hospital , and may need more serious measures like respiratory support . 
Then , a small portion of people will die . 
According to a report in the medical journal JAMA , the fatality rate in China is about 2.3 % .
