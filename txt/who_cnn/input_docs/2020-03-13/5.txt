Just days after declaring the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic , the World Health Organization on Friday announced a new response fund that companies , philanthropies and people can donate to and help fight the spread of coronavirus , also known as or COVID 19 . 
" Funds raised will be used to coordinate the response , to buy masks , gloves , gowns and goggles for health workers , to buy diagnostic tests , to improve surveillance and to invest in research and development , " he added . 
The WHO is the public health agency of the United Nations , and the new fund will be hosted by both the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation . 
" This pandemic is growing faster than our resources to respond . 
WHO has outlined a $ 675 million funding need for its COVID 19 response through April of this year alone , " Kate Dodson , vice president for global health at the United Nations Foundation , said during a phone call with reporters this week . 
" We hope it will become the foremost way for individuals , businesses and philanthropies to get involved in this fight against this virus on a global scale , " Dodson said . 
" The funds will go to support the work of WHO and partners in solidarity with countries and communities around the world to track and understand the spread of the virus ; ensure patients get the care they need and frontline workers get additional supplies and information ; help ensure all countries can prepare , especially those with the weakest health systems ; and accelerate efforts to develop vaccines , tests and treatments .
