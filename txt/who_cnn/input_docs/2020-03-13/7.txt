There is a balance between making sure someone with coronavirus is quarantined but does not feel completely isolated , according to Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization . 
Van Kerkhove addressed this nuance tonight during CNN 's coronavirus town hall which was prompted by a question from Dr . Sanjay Gupta on how countries can strike a balance between protecting health and minimizing social disruption and respecting human rights . 
The first step , Van Kerkhove claims , is making sure all coronavirus cases are identified . 
The next , is simply caring for people , she said .
