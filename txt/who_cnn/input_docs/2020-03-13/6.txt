The World Health Organization is urging countries to act quickly and aggressively test to fight the novel coronavirus . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of health emergencies programme at the World Health Organization , recounted his past experience with Ebola outbreaks , with this advice : Ryan said being prepared is paramount to keeping the virus at bay , adding , " If you need to be right before you move , you will never win . " 
" Speed trumps perfection . 
And the problem we have with society at the moment is everyone is afraid of making a mistake . 
Everyone is afraid of the consequence of error . 
But the greatest error is not to move . 
The greatest error is to be paralyzed by the fear of error , " Ryan warned . 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , a WHO infectious disease epidemiologist , said if there are countries that are actively looking and doing aggressive contact finding and starting to report high numbers of cases , " they should not be punished from that . " 
" It ’s really important that we support countries in doing the right measures and sometimes that ’s going to mean that case numbers are going to increase , " she said . 
" In many countries , it ’s going to get worse before it gets better , " Van Kerkhove added . 
" Please look for cases , please do testing and find those cases so we can turn the tide . "
