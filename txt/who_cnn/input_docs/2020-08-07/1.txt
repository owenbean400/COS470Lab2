Covid 19 has been " a tragic reminder to the world of the insecurity and instability disease can cause , " and has shown how critical it is to invest in health , the World Health Organization 's director general said on Thursday . 
" The Covid 19 pandemic has changed our world . 
It has stress tested our political , economic , cultural and social infrastructure , " Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the Aspen Security Forum . 
The world has learned the lesson that it needs to invest in pandemic preparedness and climate crisis the hard way , Tedros said , and that unless this happens , " we leave ourselves open to enormous harm . " 
All countries have been hit hard , he said , high - and low income alike , with the Americas remaining as one of the epicenters of the virus . 
" No single country can fight this virus alone . 
Its existence anywhere puts lives and livelihoods at risk everywhere , " Tedros said . 
It is never too late to turn it around , though he said ; using " science solutions and solidarity " together it is possible to overcome the pandemic . 
The first coronavirus pandemic has shown how critical health investment is to national security , Tedros said , with universal health coverage being essential for global health security . 
WHO ’s highest priority is to support all countries in strengthening their health systems so that everyone can access quality services when they are needed , he said . 
Tedros finished by urging all leaders to choose the path of cooperation , and to act now to end the virus . 
" It ’s not just the smart choice , " he said , " It ’s the right choice , and it ’s the only choice we have . "
