China is donating an additional $ 30 million to the World Health Organization to support its flight against the coronavirus pandemic , according to a tweet from China 's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying Thursday . 
Last week , US President Trump announced he is halting funding to the WHO , saying it 's been a " role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus . " 
China contributed close to $ 86 million in assessed and voluntary contributions in the two year funding cycle from 2018 to 2019 . 
Recently , skepticism has been aimed toward the WHO 's relationship with China as critics have questioned whether the WHO is independent enough , pointing to the WHO 's effusive praise of China 's response to the coronavirus pandemic .
