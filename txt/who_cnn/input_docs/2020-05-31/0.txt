The World Health Organization on Saturday released new guidance for mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic , recommending a number of possible changes to large events -- once they ’re allowed to take place . 
Holding gatherings outdoors , limiting attendance to healthy people and staggering arrivals could all help limit the spread of the virus , according to the guidance . 
" In the context of Covid 19 , mass gatherings are events that could amplify the transmission of the virus and potentially disrupt the host country ’s response capacity , " the guidance said . 
But it said large events offered benefits , too , such as providing employment and boosting psychological well being . 
The WHO called on public health authorities and event organizers to perform a risk assessment before any gathering and listed a number of steps organizers could take if large events do occur , such as : Staggering arrivals Increasing the frequency of transport Designating seating Venue capacity could also be adjusted Events could be held virtually or outdoors Some recommendations focused on participants , reminding people to observe physical distancing , cough etiquette and hand hygiene practices . 
People at risk of developing severe illness – including those over the age of 65 or with pre existing medical conditions – could be advised to stay away , or special arrangements could be made for them . 
The WHO recommendations included a number of other measures as well , such as limiting the duration of events and providing on site isolation facilities for people who become sick .
