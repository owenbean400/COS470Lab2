It ’s hard to draw many conclusions at this point from the vaccine data published Monday by the University of Oxford , said Dr . Peter Hotez , professor and dean of Tropical Medicine at the US ' Baylor College of Medicine , during an interview with CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer . 
Hotez predicted it will take until the middle of next year to find out if the vaccine actually works . 
" Looking at the data coming out of the Astra Zeneca Oxford vaccine , in a single dose , the vaccine did not seem to do all that much . 
The levels of virus neutralizing antibody , which many think is a good indicator of whether the vaccines are going to work , were not very high , " Hotez said . 
" In two doses it seemed to be better , but there were only 10 patients who got the two doses . " 
" So , it 's really hard to conclude , very much from this , " he said . 
Hotez said the results suggest a larger trial is needed . 
" And that ’s the idea behind Operation Warp Speed . 
All of these vaccines will start entering phase 3 clinical trials at various times over the next year and then it ’ll take a year to accumulate all the data showing the vaccines actually work , as well as that they ’re safe ... 
But keep in mind the first vaccines may not be our best vaccines , added Hotez . 
" It ’s looking like many of them are just partially protective , potentially preventing people from getting very sick , but not interrupting transmission . 
So , even then we ’re still going to have to maintain ongoing public health control . " 
There are 23 Covid 19 vaccines currently in clinical trials globally , according to the World Health Organization .
