A renewed focus on the potential use of the malarial drug hydroxychloroquine is taking time and resources away from the search for something that actually does work to help coronavirus patients and may end up costing lives , two dozen Yale University researchers said Tuesday . 
Yale cancer epidemiologist Dr . Harvey Risch launched a new round of headlines when he wrote a commentary in Newsweek last month calling for renewed research on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus , despite multiple studies showing it does not help and might harm patients , and decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration , National Institutes of Health , and the World Health Organization to stop further testing . 
The White House , which had promoted the drug , was encouraged to renew its lobbying for the drug , even as coronavirus task force members , including Dr . Anthony Fauci , Dr . Deborah Birx and Adm . Brett Giroir , all said repeatedly the drug does not work and should be dropped . 
The Yale researchers said they all want the same thing : an effective treatment for coronavirus . 
But they said heavy pursuit of hydroxychloroquine took up resources that could be used elsewhere . 
" The continuing advocacy on behalf of HCQ distracts us from advancing the science on Covid 19 and seeking more effective interventions in a time when more than 1,000 people are dying per day of this disease , " they wrote .
