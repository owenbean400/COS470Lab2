A disease like Covid 19 exploits all the vulnerabilities that are present for individuals , communities and health systems , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization ’s health emergencies program , said during a media briefing in Geneva on Thursday . 
" A disease like this exploits all of the vulnerabilities – and the underlying vulnerabilities – that individuals , communities and health systems have . 
We ’ve seen that , " Ryan said . 
Ryan also said that there have been hospital systems that have collapsed and huge queues of people who have not been able to access health care . 
He described health as not a reward for development , but as a primary investment in the security of communities , states and economies . 
Epidemics , Ryan said , are a " massive stress test for the system . " 
In a short period of time , they place much of the system under stress . 
The ability of the system to absorb the stress determines the damage that is done . 
He compared this situation to building a house , saying that if you build a house well and with the view that a storm might come , it will be able to withstand the storm . 
" If the storm comes and your house is not prepared , then you may lose your house , " he said . 
" And I think that ’s what we ’re seeing in these situations in many , many countries . " 
Epidemics themselves cause a major impact , which is amplified by weaknesses in the underlying health infrastructure , Ryan said . 
" And we ’re paying a heavy price , again , for the lack of that investment . "
