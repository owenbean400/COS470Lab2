World Health Organization officials looked back on the global response to the Covid 19 pandemic during a news briefing in Geneva on Thursday , the six month mark of Covid 19 being declared a public health emergency of international concern . 
Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO ’s technical lead for Covid 19 , said that the global response can be characterized as mixed . 
Countries that have had previous experience with infectious diseases , such as SARS , avian influenza and MERS , " really saw the threat , really knew the threat of this , " she said . 
Countries that did not act as fast have also been able to turn things around , Van Kerkhove said , as have countries that had very difficult outbreaks , such as the Republic of Korea , Italy , Spain and Germany . 
These countries were able to implement the comprehensive approach to public health measures , where it was " all of government , all of society , engaging their public , informing their public " and using tools that are known to suppress transmission and save lives if they are implemented . 
" I think what we need to do going forward is look at how we can be more efficient in our response . 
How can everyone be more efficient in the tools that we apply , so that we do not have to go into large lockdown , or so called lockdown measures , " Van Kerkhove said . 
" That we can tailor the approach to the geographic area , and to the transmission area where it ’s needed . "
