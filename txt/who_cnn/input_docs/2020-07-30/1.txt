Coronavirus cases in African countries are much higher than official numbers suggest because of " lack of data due to a variety of factors , " the International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) warned Thursday . 
Inadequate data : The global humanitarian aid organization said the lack of data -- due to several factors including testing capacity , health infrastructure devastated by conflict , and stigma -- is " seriously impacting the ability to plan and execute an effective COVID response . " 
" Where testing is insufficient , we are fighting this disease in the dark . 
The doubling of confirmed COVID cases in July across African countries is alarming , but we are worried that this could be the tip of the iceberg , " said Stacey Mearns , senior technical advisor of emergency health at the IRC . 
" For all the countries where we work in the region , testing rates fall far below WHO guidelines . 
Without testing , there are indeed ' no cases ' -- but this does not mean the virus is not spreading unchecked , " Mearns added .
