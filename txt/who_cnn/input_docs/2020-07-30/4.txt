Younger people are at risk of severe disease from Covid 19 and need to be protecting themselves , World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in Geneva on Thursday . 
" Although older people are at a higher risk of severe disease , younger people are at risk too , " Tedros said . 
" One of the challenges we face is convincing younger people of this risk . " 
There is evidence , he said , that suggests spikes in cases in some countries are being driven partly by younger people letting their guard down . 
They should take the same precautions as everyone else to protect themselves and others . 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO technical lead for Covid 19 , reiterated that young people should be taking precautions and managing their own risk . 
" What we know about young people is that young people can infected , young people can transmit the virus to others , the majority of young people who are infected tend to have more mild disease , but that is not always consistent , " she said . 
" We know that young people can develop severe disease , we know that young people can end up in ICU and we know that young people can die . " 
She also said that they are learning more about the long term effects of the disease , even in people who had mild disease . 
A number of patient groups have formed with people who are having long term effects , including extreme fatigue or shortness of breath . 
WHO has reached out to some of these groups so they can hear about their experiences directly and use them for future planning around rehabilitation and longer term care .
