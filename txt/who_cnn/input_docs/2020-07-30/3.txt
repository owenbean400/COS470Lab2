With Africa approaching one million reported coronavirus infections , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on Thursday warned against the easing of restrictions across the continent as case numbers doubled over the past month . 
More than 20 countries across Africa have recorded a higher number of new cases than in the previous weeks , Moeti said , adding that only five countries account for 75 % of the total cases , with South Africa accounting for most . 
" In the past 25 days the cases have doubled [ in Africa ] with South Africa continuing to account for the majority of cases " , however , " fewer new cases have been reported in the past seven days " she added . 
Moeti said that underreporting of cases exists in Africa , but not enough to have a " huge underestimation . " 
" We do not think here are thousands of people dying undetected on the continent , " Moeti said , however — commenting on an increase in the number of natural deaths in South Africa compared to last year — she said that WHO recognizes " that there is underreporting of cases , and possibly underreporting of deaths as well . " 
" There is a question being raised on whether or not the discrepancy is linked with Covid 19 related deaths . 
This is something we ’re looking into , " Moeti added . 
Some countries are doing well including Uganda , Seychelles and Mauritius however there was an increase in new cases reported in Kenya , Madagascar , Nigeria , Zambia , Zimbabwe , she said . 
Moeti also said that some people in Africa with other diseases have been negatively affected by Covid 19 . 
" Other diseases and conditions are disadvantaged now , as people are afraid of getting treated and going to health units for medical assistance , due to the risks of Covid 19 , " she said . 
With almost 890,000 reported cases and 18,000 deaths , Africa is expected to cross the one million mark in the coming week , WHO said .
