Everyone must learn to live with Covid 19 while staying protected , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said during a briefing in Geneva on Thursday . 
While Tedros acknowledged this is not easy , he said it can be done . 
" The pandemic does not mean life has to stop , " Tedros said . 
He congratulated the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the steps that were put in place to make the Hajj as safe as possible this year , calling it a " powerful demonstration of the kinds of measures that countries can – and must – take to adapt to the new normal . " 
CNN previously reported that Saudi Arabia will limit the number of people who could take part in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca , and that it would be restricted to pilgrims of all nationalities who already reside in the country .
