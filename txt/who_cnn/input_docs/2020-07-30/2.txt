Today marks six months since Covid 19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said earlier this week . 
Previous health emergencies of this level of concern have included Ebola , Zika and H1N1 . 
Tedros said that nearly 16 million coronavirus cases and more than 640,000 deaths worldwide have been reported to WHO . 
" And the pandemic continues to accelerate , " he said . 
" In the past six weeks , the total number of cases has roughly doubled . " 
Tedros said Monday that he will reconvene WHO â€™s emergency committee , as required under International Health Regulations , later in the week to re evaluate the pandemic . 
He said that he was very proud of WHO , its people and their efforts , as they have " worked tirelessly to support countries to prepare for and respond to this virus " over the last six months . 
And there is still work to be done , Tedros said . 
" We have done an incredible amount , but we still have a long , hard road ahead of us , " Tedros said .
