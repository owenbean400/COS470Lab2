The World Health Organization has released a policy brief on preventing and managing Covid 19 in long term care facilities . 
Older people , especially those living in long term care facilities , are one of the groups that are at highest risk for Covid 19 . 
The policy brief lists key actions that must be taken by policymakers and national and local authorities to protect older people , Tedros said . 
They range from integrating long term care into national response , to providing support for family and voluntary caregivers . 
For each objective , there are actions that can be taken by the facilities themselves , and examples of actions that have been taken by countries across the world . 
" The brief also suggests ways to transform long term care services so that older people can receive quality of care that respects their rights , freedoms and dignity , " Tedros said . 
Tedros also acknowledged those who worked in long term care facilities across the world , " who are doing heroic work to save lives and protect those in their care , " he said . 
" I salute you . "
