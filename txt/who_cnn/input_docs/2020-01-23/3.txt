The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is holding a meeting today where it could decide whether the spread of the Wuhan virus constitutes " a public health emergency of international concern . " 
The WHO held a similar meeting yesterday but delayed its decision , due to a lack of information . 
" The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously , and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence , " WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters Wednesday . 
" Today , there was an excellent discussion during committee meeting but it was also clear that to proceed , we need more information , " he said . 
The WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as " an extraordinary event " that constitutes a " public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease " and " to potentially require a coordinated international response . " 
Previous emergencies have included Ebola , Zika and H1N1 .
