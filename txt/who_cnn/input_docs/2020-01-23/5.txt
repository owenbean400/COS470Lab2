The Wuhan coronavirus that has killed at least 17 people and infected more than 600 spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought , according to a World Health Organization ( WHO ) official . 
" We are now seeing second and third generation spread , " said Dr . David Heymann , the chairperson of a WHO committee that is gathering data on the virus . 
Third generation means that someone who became infected after handling animals at the market in Wuhan , China , spreads the virus to someone else , who then spreads it to a third person . 
The virus initially appeared to spread only by very close contact that would typically occur within a family , such as hugging , kissing , or sharing eating utensils , Heymann said . 
Now , he says evidence is accruing that shows more distant contact could spread the virus , such as if a sick person were to sneeze or cough near someone else â€™s face . 
He said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room , as happens with the flu or measles .
