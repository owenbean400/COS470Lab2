Woody Johnson , the US ambassador to the UK , has accused China of engaging in " blatant and dangerous propaganda " about the coronavirus , saying the world might have been spared the full impact had Chinese officials not suppressed facts early on . 
In an opinion piece published in Britain ’s The Times newspaper , Johnson says China failed in its obligation to the international community to share information about the outbreak transparently . 
He added that when the crisis abates , there will need to be an evaluation of the costs of the " breakdown in international collaboration " and China ’s actions early on . 
Some context : China has faced criticism both internationally and domestically for its handling of the outbreak in the first few weeks , when local officials in Wuhan detained and targeted doctors who tried to speak out about the emergence of a new virus . 
One of those doctors , Li Wenliang , later died of the virus , sparking fury and calls for freedom of speech on Chinese social media . 
Earlier this month , the Chinese government included Li in a list of of 506 healthcare and response workers who acted as " advanced individuals in the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in national health system . " 
WHO response : The World Health Organization has acknowledged " mistakes " made by China , but its officials have largely been positive about how the country has responded to the crisis .
