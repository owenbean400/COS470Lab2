Several countries in the Asia Pacific region have entered a " new phase of the pandemic , " World Health Organization officials said today . 
Kasai added that " the epidemic is changing . 
People in their 20s , 30s , and 40s , are increasingly driving its spread . " 
Patients in these age groups are more likely to have mild or even no symptoms -- a cause for concern , as the virus becomes harder to detect early enough to prevent its spread . 
" For example , in the Philippines and Victoria , Australia , more than half of the reported cases ( are ) people below the age of 40 , " said WHO official Dr . Tamano Matsui . 
" The same is true in Japan , where 65 % of the infections reported from July through August are among people aged 39 and below . " 
Return of surging cases : This new phase may see some countries experience surges that are even larger than their initial outbreaks , Kasai said -- but after months of practice , governments are more able now to minimize disruptions and respond to the health threat . 
He added that the rise of cases in younger age groups is because they are the most active members of society , and also due to better testing . 
He also noted that it 's " still an open question " on whether people who have tested positive can be reinfected . 
WHO still does not have any definitive evidence on immunity .
