Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization â€™s Health Emergencies Program , said they are " concerned that some countries are having difficulties in exiting the so called lockdowns as they 're seeing increases of cases again . " 
" First and foremost , most of the world right now is still very much in the throes of the first wave of this pandemic , " Ryan said during a briefing Friday , adding though that many countries have been able to flatten the curve and are slowly making their way out of lockdowns . 
" There must be an alternative to lockdown because in the absence of lockdown , the virus will tend to spread again . 
So the question is , what have you got to replace lockdown with ? " 
Ryan asked . 
He pointed countries towards a strong public health system , testing and tracking cases , and educating the population to help as lockdowns are lifted . 
" It 's very easy for me to sit here and say that that is difficult to achieve in any circumstance , " he said . 
" But it is the only way to sustain the next number of months while we wait for other interventions . 
And again we have to say that we really hope we have an effective vaccine in time , but there are no guarantees . " 
" We have to learn to live with the virus , " Ryan said .
