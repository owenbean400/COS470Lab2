New Zealand ’s early decision to ban travel from China and then Iran is why the country has been able to dramatically curb the spread of coronavirus , said the country ’s former Prime Minister Helen Clark . 
New Zealand instituted the measure despite the World Health Organization advising against travel bans . 
" I think the WHO ’s position is that it does not endorse or advocate travel bans , " Clark told BBC radio . 
" And that ’s got quite a lot to do with the murky geopolitical realm within which it operates . 
And also because it fears that if it were to support it , it might not get full cooperation from countries . 
" And I think New Zealanders will be pretty hesitant to see people just flying back in again . " 
Over the past few days , newly diagnosed infections have been in the single digits . 
And on Monday , New Zealand reported just one new case . 
Clark was Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1999 to 2008 . 
She later headed the UN ’s Development Programme for eight years .
