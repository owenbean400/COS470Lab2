World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency " can only give advice , but one thing should be clear -- we do not have any mandate to force countries to implement what we advise them . " 
On January 30 , the WHO declared the highest level of global emergency . 
" During that time , as you may remember , there were only 82 cases outside China , " he said . 
" The world should have listened to WHO then , carefully , " Tedros said . 
" Every country could have triggered all its public health measures possible . " 
At the time , the WHO advised the world to find , test , isolate and contract trace for each case .
