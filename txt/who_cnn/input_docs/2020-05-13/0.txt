Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization 's Health Emergencies Programme , said the world needs to reach " a point of very significant control over the virus " to no longer consider coronavirus a pandemic . 
Ryan said as countries try to find a path toward a new normal , " we 're going to be on that pathway for a long , long time . " 
He explained that the International Health Regulations only allows two choices : there is either a global public health emergency , or there is not . 
" We can obviously , as time goes on in our risk assessment , reduce the level of alert at national , regional and global levels , through our systematic risk assessment process , " Ryan said . 
" At the moment , we obviously consider the risks to still be high . " 
Ryan said as time goes on , WHO could consider moving the risk assessments for each country down , but " that is going to require us reaching a point of very significant control over the virus , very strong public health surveillance and stronger health systems in place to cope with any recurrent cases . " 
" I think we 're going to have to remain on alert , stay the course and ensure that we 're ready to respond , " he said .
