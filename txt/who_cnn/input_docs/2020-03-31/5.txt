Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said he would " lean towards " recommending that the general public wear face masks " if we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them . " 
During a taping for tomorrow ’s " Coronavirus : Fact vs . Fiction " podcast , Fauci told CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta that face masks would be a " subject of conversation " at a White House briefing later that day . 
Despite a lack of conclusive evidence that masks prevent transmission of respiratory diseases , some experts have argued that non medical fabric masks might make a dent in transmission risk . 
Throughout the pandemic so far , the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised against the general public 's use of masks unless they are already sick . 
" Something does not have to be 100 % effective to be beneficial , " Fauci said . 
At yesterday 's White House Task Force briefing , President Trump said , " We are not going to be wearing masks forever , but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear . 
I could see something like that happening for a period of time . "
