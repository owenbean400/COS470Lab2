It is " very important " to get quick results from coronavirus tests in order to implement the public health measures that are needed to control Covid 19 , World Health Organization officials said at a press conference in Geneva on Monday . 
" It ’s very important that when you have a test that is done , that you have the answers to that test quickly , " said Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO ’s technical lead for coronavirus . 
Unfortunately , she said , there are many parts of the world where it takes quite a long time to get test results back . 
Once someone has been confirmed to be infected with the virus , whether they have symptoms or not , they need to be isolated – and knowing that they are infected means that contact tracing can be carried out . 
" This is what breaks chains of transmission , " Van Kerkhove said . 
" If we have results back in four or five days , even longer , that is not going to help us . " 
Having rapid tests in development is a positive thing and will help control efforts , she said . 
Van Kerkhove also pointed out that WHO teams are working with their partners across the globe to quickly evaluate rapid tests to see how well they perform , and that they give accurate results . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Programme , reiterated the importance of quick test results . 
" Getting the time from testing to confirming the status of the patient is the single most important thing , " he said . 
" There ’s no point having a test result a week later , when the public health action is late . " 
In places where there is limited capacity in laboratories , Ryan said , " You must focus on trying to detect suspect cases , confirming those cases , isolating those cases , quarantining contacts , and … taking all of the measures necessary . " 
He called this the most efficient use of testing at the current time .
