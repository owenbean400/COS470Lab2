" I hope we will never see something like this again , " she said . 
" But we also must use this as an opportunity to build back stronger , to build back better . " 
Van Kerkhove said that Covid 19 should be used as an opportunity to enhance public health infrastructure , and to build it up in many places . 
That means having surveillance in place , having a public health workforce in place , having trained health workers – who have the right equipment and personal protective equipment – and ensuring that there is the supplies that protect frontline workers , who in turn protect everyone else . 
" Again , we need to use this as an opportunity to build back better , " she said .
