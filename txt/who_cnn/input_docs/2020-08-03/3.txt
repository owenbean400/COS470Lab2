The Covid 19 pandemic has disrupted health services around the world , according to officials at the World Health Organization . 
Ryan said that WHO is analyzing a recent survey that was completed by WHO member states . 
It shows that three quarters of member states reported partial or complete disruption of immunization services , rehabilitation services and dental services , he said . 
Two thirds have reported partial or complete disruption of non communicable disease , chronic diseases diagnosis and treatment , family planning and treatment of mental health disorders . 
More than half reported disruptions of malaria treatment campaigns , distribution of insecticide treated nets , antenatal care , cancer diagnosis and treatment , palliative care services , and services for sick children . 
" What we ’re seeing is a secondary effect , in terms of both provision and access of health care , " Ryan said . 
This secondary effect challenges and threatens the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals , he said . 
The economic impacts are also having direct impacts " on the loss of purchasing power for many people , in terms of accessing health services in countries where there are user fees , " Ryan said . 
" In this case , as health services become less and less accessible , as potential costs and user fees increase , and as people ’s disposable income decreases , we fear that people will be making unhealthy choices , or choices not to seek health care because the cost of doing so is so difficult for them and their family , " he said .
