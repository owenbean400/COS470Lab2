No further cases of the mutated strain of coronavirus have been found in Danish minks , leading scientists to believe that the strain has " most likely become extinct . " 
The Danish Health Ministry said that mink in seven municipalities have now been killed and temporary restrictions on people can be relaxed . 
The discovery of the virus in mink earlier this month prompted authorities to order all mink in Denmark to be culled . 
The Danish Medicines Agency said it is " unlikely " that the mutated form of coronavirus will have any significant impact on the efficacy of the first generation of vaccines . 
Danish officials had previously expressed concern that the outbreak in mink could pose a risk to vaccine efficacy . 
The World Health Organization â€™s Senior Emergency Officer in Europe , Catherine Smallwood , reiterated on Thursday that culling was an " appropriate measure . " 
However , the culling sparked a government backtrack after it discovered it had no legal authority to mandate the killing of mink of farms that did not have cases of coronavirus . 
Instead the government was only able to make a recommendation to farmers .
