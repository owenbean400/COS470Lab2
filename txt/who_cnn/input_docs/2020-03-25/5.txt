World Health Organization officials warned during a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday that globally there is a " significant shortage " of medical supplies , including personal protective gear or PPE . 
This issue is something that officials said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will be bringing up at the G20 summit on Thursday . 
All elements of the supply chain appear to be under " extreme strain , " Dr . Mike Ryan , WHO executive director of the health emergencies program , said during the briefing . 
" There are problems in the supply chain all along that chain . 
The simple issue is demand , " Ryan said . 
" There are shortages of PPE , shortages of ventilators and other products for the medical response to Covid . 
We also have to avoid shortages in other medical supplies , as supply chains come under strain . "
