The World Health Organization is warning that opening schools and businesses too early could cause a resurgence of coronavirus . 
" We understand that these countries are now trying to assess when and how they will be able to ease these measures . 
The answer depends on what countries do while these population wide measures are in place , " WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said . 
Speaking on Wednesday , Tedros said , " Asking people to stay at home and shutting down population movement is buying time and reducing the pressure on health systems . 
But on their own , these measures will not extinguish epidemics . "
