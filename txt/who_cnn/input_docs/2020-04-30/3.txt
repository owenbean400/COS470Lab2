Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for remdesivir soon to treat Covid 19 . 
Speaking Tuesday during an appearance on the Today show , Fauci said that while the FDA has not made a final decision yet , he projects " it â€™s going to be really quickly . " 
Fauci said he believes Gilead Sciences , the maker of remdesivir , is committed to make the treatment available " as much as they can , as quickly as they can . " 
" I 'm pretty confident that will be the case because I believe they 're committed to trying to get this out as quickly as possible , " Fauci told NBC 's Savannah Guthrie . 
What this is about : A trial of the experimental drug remdesivir showed it might help patients recover more quickly from the infection . 
Yesterday , Fauci was optimistic about the results , saying " The data shows that remdesivir has a clear cut , significant , positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery . " 
However the World Health Organization said it 's too early to comment on the remdesivir trial results released Wednesday .
