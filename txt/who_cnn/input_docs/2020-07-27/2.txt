The best way to deal with Covid 19 is to have a seamless relationship between national and local strategy , said Dr . Mike Ryan , the World Health Organization ’s health emergencies program ’s executive director . 
" It ’s striking that balance between what is national or federal strategy and what is local implementation , in the sense you fight what you see , and the only people who really see what ’s happening are at local , " he said . 
Reactions ca not only be based on what is seen locally though , he said ; they have to be guided by what is happening nationally . 
" In the most effective countries , what you see is a seamless relationship between a national strategy being implemented but with the local flexibility to be tactical in reaction to the disease , " said Ryan . 
He said that the right balance is national strategies that lay out , fund and support approaches , but give local authorities the ability to implement them appropriately based on what they see on the ground .
