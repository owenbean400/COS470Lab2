The coronavirus pandemic has shown what humans are capable of , both in a positive and negative way , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , said Monday at a press briefing in Geneva . 
" Covid 19 has changed our world . 
It has brought people , communities and nations together , and driven them apart , " he said . 
" It has shown what humans are capable of , both positively and negatively . " 
Tedros said that " we have learned an enormous amount , and we ’re still learning . " 
Although the world has changed , he said , the way to respond to Covid 19 and the basic measures to suppress transmission have not . 
These are political leadership and informing , engaging and listening , as well as wearing a mask where recommended , Tedros said . 
" Where these measures are followed , cases go down , " he said . 
" Where they ’re not , cases go up . " 
He gave examples of places that followed this advice " carefully and consistently " and were able to either prevent a large scale outbreak , such as New Zealand , or bring large outbreaks under control , such as Germany .
