And we may have to have a significant alteration to our lifestyles , until we get to a point where we have an effective vaccine , or an effective treatments , " Ryan said at a briefing Friday . 
To reopen , " many countries are taking a very careful step wise approach , relying on the patience and perseverance of their citizens to continue to suffer what is a difficult process both socially psychologically and economically for many people , " he said . 
" I think everyone is doing that because we want to protect those we love . " 
Ryan sees the path out involving partial school openings , partial returns to workplaces and careful measures in high density areas . 
But for events like concerts and sports , he said , " it 's going to be much more difficult to make those perfectly safe . "
