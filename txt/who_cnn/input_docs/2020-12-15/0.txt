Just over half of all planned doses of coronavirus vaccines have been bought up by high income countries such as the US , Japan and Australia , which means as much as a quarter of the world ’s population will be unable to get vaccinated until 2022 , researchers reported Tuesday . 
These rich countries have pre ordered close to 7.5 billion doses of Covid 19 vaccines , enough to vaccinate 3.76 billion people , Anthony So of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and colleagues found . 
" Just over half ( 51 % ) of these doses will go to high income countries , which represent 14 % of the world ’s population , " they wrote in their report , published in the BMJ . 
At the time the report was written , the US accounted for one fifth of all global Covid 19 cases but had reserved 800 million doses of vaccine . 
Japan , Australia , and accounted for fewer than 1 % of cases but had options on 1 billion doses . 
The researchers projected that the 13 major vaccine manufacturers working on coronavirus vaccines had the potential capacity for close to 6 billion courses of vaccine by the end of 2021 . 
" High income countries have reserved just over half of these vaccine doses from 13 leading vaccine manufacturers . 
Low and middle income countries have the remainder , despite these countries comprising more than 85 % of the world ’s population , " they wrote . 
There ’s one effort that is trying to get around this – COVAX , coordinated by the World Health Organization , global vaccines initiative Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) . 
The group is trying to build manufacturing capacity for 2 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine . 
" The COVAX Facility could play a key role in ensuring access to Covid 19 vaccines . 
However , its target of two billion doses by the end of 2021 is still short on premarket vaccine commitments and financing to deliver on this goal , " So ’s team noted .
