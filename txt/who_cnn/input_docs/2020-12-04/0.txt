World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained four key areas that countries need to invest in to help end the coronavirus pandemic . 
They are : " The pandemic has proven that a health crisis is not just a health crisis ; it is a social , economic , political and humanitarian crisis , " Tedros said during a special session of the United Nations on Friday . 
" If the world is to avoid another crisis on this scale , investments in basic public health functions — and especially primary health care — are essential . " 
Tedros called for national leaders to come together in solidarity . 
" The risks of under investment in health have wide ranging impacts , and so do the benefits of investing in health , " he said . 
" Health is an investment in successful societies . 
It enables individuals , families , communities and nations to flourish . 
The world spends $ 7.5 trillion on health every year — almost 10 % of global GDP . 
But most of this spending is in the richest countries , and is disproportionately directed to treating disease , rather than promoting and protecting health , " Tedros continued . 
" We need a radical rethink of the way we view and value health . "
