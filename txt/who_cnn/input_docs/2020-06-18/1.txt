If more people wore masks in the United States , that could be key in slowing the spread of Covid 19 , Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said during an appearance on " Morning Joe " Thursday . 
" Another study that came out recently , a mathematical modeling study , looked at the same question and found if you can get 50 % of people to wear effective masks , you would get the reproduction number under one , " Gottlieb continued . 
" Any mask is helpful , but the more protective the mask , the better . " 
Some background : Earlier this month , the World Health Organization recommended nations encourage the general public to wear masks in areas where there continues to be intense spread of the novel coronavirus — and for all health workers and caregivers to wear masks during their shifts . 
The new guidance recommends for a healthy person to wear fabric masks — which can be homemade — that are at least three layers : an inner layer of an absorbent material such as cotton ; a middle layer that acts like a filter or barrier , such as non woven material polypropylene ; and an outer layer of a non absorbent material , such as polyester or polyester blend . 
WHO currently recommends medical masks for health workers , anyone with symptoms , someone caring for someone who is sick , and people who are considered " at risk , " which includes adults 60 and older , and anyone with underlying health conditions .
