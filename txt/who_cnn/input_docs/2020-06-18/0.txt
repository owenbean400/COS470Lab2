Eight countries account for 84 % of the coronavirus cases across the African region , Dr . Matshidiso Moeti , World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa said during a Thursday briefing . 
Across the 47 countries in the Africa region , there are more than 265,000 cases and 7,000 people have died , Moeti said . 
" The majority of new cases are being reported in specific hotspot , provinces and districts in the countries concerned , " she said . 
Those countries include South Africa , Nigeria , Ghana , Côte d 'Ivoire and Cameroon . 
But other countries in the region are seeing little to no cases , Moeti said . 
" There is great disparity in the way that countries are affected by the pandemic . " 
" Seychelles , for example , has not reported a new case for more than 70 days — that ’s over a couple of months . 
Mauritius has not reported a new case in 10 days . 
And countries like Namibia and the Gambia are reporting very few new cases . " 
Moeti said a cluster of cases in refugee camps in South Sudan is " a matter of great concern . " 
" The situation in which people are living in refugee camps , the type of housing that they have , and the challenges that could arise then with interventions like social distancing " make refugee camps a top priority , she said . 
Moeti said WHO is " working on a global humanitarian response plan that was launched by the Secretary General , to mobilize the resources that are needed to make sure that the interventions that need to be put in place , are put in place in refugee camps first . "
