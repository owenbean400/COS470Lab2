Mothers infected with Covid 19 are unlikely to pass the infection to their newborns when appropriate health precautions are taken , according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health . 
Researchers reported no cases of viral transmission among 120 babies born to 116 Covid positive mothers , even when both shared a room and the mothers breastfed . 
Still , precautions were taken : Babies remained in enclosed cribs and six feet apart from their mothers , except while breastfeeding . 
Mothers were also required to wear surgical masks when handling their child and followed proper hand and breast washing procedures . 
All babies included in the study were tested for Covid 19 via a nasal swab within 24 hours after birth . 
After , researchers conducted follow up exams and tests . 
Of the original 120 babies , 82 completed a follow up five to seven days after birth . 
The majority , 68 babies , had roomed with their mothers and 64 were still breastfed . 
Seventy nine of these babies were tested again at five to seven days , and 72 were tested two weeks after birth . 
None of the results were positive , and none of the babies showed Covid 19 symptoms , the team at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian children ’s hospital reported . 
They noted that blood , fecal and urine Covid 19 tests had not been approved at the time of the study . 
If a baby was infected in the womb , the nasal swab test might not have detected the virus . 
The researchers also relied on what the mothers reported themselves about their hand hygiene and mask usage . 
Recommendations for mothers with Covid 19 and their newborns vary . 
The study affirms current guidance by the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics . 
The pediatricians ’ group updated its guidance Wednesday .
