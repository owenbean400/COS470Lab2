The World Health Organization said the downward trend of coronavirus cases did not occur naturally , and is warning countries not to become complacent . 
" Many countries have paid a heavy price in doing the measures that have needed to be done to suppress the transmission of this disease , and they deserve credit , " Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO ’s health emergencies program , said during a Monday briefing . 
Ryan said it ’s " worrisome " when people assume the downward trend occurred naturally . 
In reality , Ryan said , " that has occurred because of very , very , very tough public health measures that have been tough on the population . " 
Maria Van Kerkhove , a WHO infectious disease epidemiologist , said " there 's a certain predictability of this virus , " adding , " anytime you become complacent and you think you know , it will surprise you . " 
" I understand very well and I am in the same boat as you – we all want this to be over , but we have a long way to go , " Van Kerkhove said . 
Ryan said removing pressure on the virus at this point and assuming " the real next danger point is sometime in October or November " is a " dangerous assumption . " 
Van Kerkhove said it could get worse if we have " co infection or co circulation of influenza and Covid 19 . "
