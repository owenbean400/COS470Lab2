The World Health Organization has temporarily halted studying hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid 19 treatment in its Solidarity Trial due to safety concerns , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in Geneva on Monday . 
The decision was made after an observational study was published in the medical journal The Lancet on Friday , which described how seriously ill Covid 19 patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were more likely to die . 
Tedros said that an independent executive group is now reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine in WHO 's Solidarity Trial . 
The trial , which involves actively recruiting patients from more than 400 hospitals in 35 countries , is a global research effort to find safe and effective therapeutics for Covid 19 . 
" The Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial , representing 10 of the participating countries , met on Saturday and has agreed to review a comprehensive analysis and critical appraisal of all evidence available globally , " Tedros said on Monday . 
Tedros added that the other arms of the trial are continuing . 
" This concern relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in Covid 19 , " Tedros said . 
" I wish to reiterate that these drugs are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria . "
