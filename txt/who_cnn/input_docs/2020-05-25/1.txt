The World Health Organization is warning of a second peak – not necessarily a second wave – of coronavirus cases . 
During a media briefing on Monday , Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Programme , said right now , we are " right in the middle of the first wave , globally . " 
" We 're still very much in a phase where the disease is actually on the way up , " he added . 
Ryan warned that a second peak or wave could come during the normal influenza season , " which will greatly complicate things for disease control . " 
Maria Van Kerkhove , a WHO infectious disease epidemiologist , said " all countries need to remain on high alert here . 
All countries need to be ready to rapidly detect cases , even countries that have had success in suppression . 
… Even countries that have seen a decline in cases must remain ready . " 
Van Kerkhove said if given the opportunity , the virus will start an outbreak . 
" A hallmark of coronaviruses is its ability to amplify in certain settings , its ability to cause transmission – or super spreading events . 
And we are seeing in a number of situations in these closed settings . 
When the virus has an opportunity , it can transmit readily , " she said .
