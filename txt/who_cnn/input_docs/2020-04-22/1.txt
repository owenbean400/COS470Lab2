In what could be the first lawsuit filed by a state against China , Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the loss of life and economic consequences in Missouri from the coronavirus , according to a statement from Schmitt â€™s office . 
The lawsuit was filed against the Chinese government , Chinese Communist Party and other Chinese institutions accusing the government of suppressing information , arresting whistleblowers and denying the " contagious nature " of Covid 19 , leading to severe consequences in Missouri . 
The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and alleges " during the critical weeks of the initial outbreak , Chinese authorities deceived the public , suppressed crucial information , arrested whistleblowers , denied human to human transmission in the face of mounting evidence , destroyed critical medical research , permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus , and even hoarded personal protective equipment -- thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable . " 
The lawsuit alleges that Chinese officials did little to contain the spread of the virus despite having knowledge of the disease . 
It also alleges the government denied the potential of human to human transmission when it informed the World Health Organization about the outbreak , despite having evidence of such transmission . 
Missouri has at least 6,105 cases of the virus and at least 229 deaths related to it , according to numbers from Johns Hopkins University . 
CNN has reached out to the Chinese government for comment . 
Legal experts have said the lawsuit faces an uphill battle because China is protected by sovereign immunity .
