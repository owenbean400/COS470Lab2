The World Health Organization ( WHO ) Regional Office for Africa said they are " seeing some rapid increases " in cases during a press briefing on Thursday . 
Dr . Matshidiso Moeti , the WHO Regional Director for Africa said , " It took 36 days to reach 1,000 reported cases , and then 62 days to move to 100,000 cases . 
We are just above 100,000 now . " 
Moeti said it â€™s a mixed bag across the continent , " Compared to two weeks ago , reported cases have tripled in five countries and doubled in 10 countries , noting that most countries still have fewer than 1,000 reported cases . " 
Governments in each country have been working day and night to " procure and replenish essential supplies and equipment , " Moeti said and added that this remains one of the biggest challenges of the response . 
" With strong country leadership and implementation of public and social health measures , cases in Africa remain lower than in some other parts of the world . 
However , we are not letting our guard down and we cannot be complacent , " she said .
