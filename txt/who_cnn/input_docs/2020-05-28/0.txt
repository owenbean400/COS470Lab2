The Covid 19 outbreak has been responsible for 159,000 excess deaths in 24 European countries since early March , World Health Organization ( WHO ) Europe Director Hans Henri Kluge announced on Thursday . 
Excess deaths is a term used to define the number of deaths which occurred in a given crisis above and beyond what would have been expected under ‘ normal ’ conditions . 
The WHO lists 53 countries in its Europe region , including Russia and Turkey . 
According to Kluge , there have been over two million confirmed Covid 19 cases and over 175,000 confirmed deaths in the European region . 
Kluge said these death numbers are " above and beyond what we would have expected normally at this time of the year . " 
Case information reported to the WHO has revealed that 94 % of all Covid 19 deaths were people over the age of 60 years old , and 59 % of those deaths were men . 
From the total deaths , 97 % of the cases had at least one underlying health condition , with cardiovascular disease being the most common . 
Kluge also gave an update on the current spread of the virus in Europe , saying that in the past 14 days cumulative cases in the region have increased by 15 % , with the region still accounting for 38 % of cases and 50 % of deaths globally . 
Russia , the United Kingdom , Belarus , Turkey and Italy are the countries that have reported the highest cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in the last two weeks , Kluge said . 
Spain , Italy , the UK and France continue to account for 72 % of all European Covid 19 deaths , he added . 
As countries across the region continue to ease restrictions , Kluge stressed that " there can be no economic recovery without Covid 19 transmission under control . " 
He advised leaders to examine the lessons of the 2008 financial crash , where many countries cut spending on healthcare .
