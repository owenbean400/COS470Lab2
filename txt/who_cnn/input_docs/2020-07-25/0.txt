The first concern with a vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection will be safety , former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr . Thomas Frieden said Friday . 
" This is the first time we 've had an anti vaccine movement before we 've had the vaccine , " Frieden said in a podcast sponsored by the online news site Axios . 
That makes it important to be honest and open with people about the risks , he said . 
One concern is a potential immune reaction to vaccination , he said . 
" Because some of the adverse outcomes from Covid 19 are immune regulated , and that raises the theoretical concern that something like the Kawasaki like illness that you 're seeing in rare instances of childhood illness could be a rare adverse event of vaccination , " he said . 
Frieden said if a coronavirus vaccine is approved , he ’d get one . 
" If there ’s enough vaccine enough to provide for essential workers and particularly health care workers first and it 's demonstrated to be safe and effective , I 'd be delighted to get vaccinated , " Frieden said . 
" There are a lot of hurdles to get over before we actually have a vaccine available , proven to be effective , demonstrated to be safe and widely used , " he added . 
" First and foremost is safety and efficacy , " he said . 
" Does it work , how well , for whom , for how long and is it safe ? " 
So far 25 vaccines are in human trials around the world and 141 more are in preclinical trials , according to the World Health Organization . 
But a vaccine will not be the only solution to the pandemic . 
" I think what we have to get past is the idea that there is one thing that ’s going to make Covid go away , " Frieden said .
