Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday that if face masks were " considered to help , then I would do it . " 
When asked by a reporter why he does not wear a face mask and how that message would influence people , López Obrador said that it 's not " scientifically proven . " 
The World Health Organization and public health experts have emphasized masks are one of the most effective tools to help fight the pandemic . 
López Obrador said the country ’s health ministry , lead led by Dr . Jorge Alcocer and Dr . Hugo López Gatell , advised him not to wear a face mask . 
" The main point of all the campaign has been the ‘ safe distance , ’ and we 've taken care of this . 
Dr . Alcocer and López Gatell have told me that I do not need to wear a mask if I keep the distance , in the places where is necessary , I 'll wear it , " López Obrador said . 
Some context : Mexico 's health ministry reported 7,573 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Friday , bringing the country 's total to 378,285 . 
López Obrador has said that the high numbers are due to " increased testing and a delay of the information , " though Mexico has one of the lowest testing rates of any large country worldwide .
