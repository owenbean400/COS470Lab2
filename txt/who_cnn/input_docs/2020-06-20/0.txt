Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg has said the pandemic shows the world can act with " necessary force " when it wants to , while comparing the reaction to Covid 19 with efforts to fight climate change . 
Thunberg said people in positions of power in politics , business and finance had said " they will do whatever it takes , " during the pandemic as " you ca not put a price on a human life . " 
The activist said that when millions had died because of air pollution , those were lives " [ society ] can put a price on . " 
" Those words and this treatment of a crisis opens up a whole new dimension because you see every year at least 7 million people die from illnesses related to air pollution according to the WHO , " she said . 
" Those are apparently peoples whose lives we can put a price on . 
Since they died from the wrong causes and in the wrong parts of the world . " 
Thunberg inspired worldwide climate protests last year after staging weekly sit ins outside the Swedish Parliament on Fridays from August 2018 .
