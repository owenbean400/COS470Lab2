The World Health Organization announced an agreement to make rapid Covid 19 tests available to lower and middle income countries across the world . 
During a Monday news conference , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , WHO director general said , " a substantial proportion of this rapid tests — 120 million — will be made available to low and middle income countries . 
These tests provide reliable results in approximately 15 to 30 minutes , rather than hours or days , at a lower price , with less sophisticated equipment . " 
Tedros said these " vital " tests will help expand testing in remote areas , " that do not have lab facilities or enough trained health workers to carry out PCR tests . " 
Peter Sands , executive director of the Global Fund said , " Being able to deploy quality antigen RDTs , rapid diagnostic tests , will be a significant step forward in enabling countries to contain and combat Covid 19 . " 
The tests are " not a silver bullet , " Sands said . 
" But hugely valuable as a complement to PCR tests . " 
" Although they 're a bit less accurate — they 're much faster , cheaper , and do not require a lab , " he explained . 
Sands said these tests will help low and middle income countries to " close the dramatic gap in testing between rich and poor countries . " 
" Right now , high income countries are conducting 292 tests per day per 100,000 people . 
For upper middle income countries , that number is 77 . 
For lower middle income countries , 61 , and from low income countries , 14 , " Sands said , though he did not expand on where that data originates .
