Students over the age of 12 will be advised to use face coverings at schools in Scotland as part of new guidelines set to be issued by the Scottish government on Tuesday . 
Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland on Tuesday that " from August 31 young people over the age of 12 at secondary schools should be habitually wearing face coverings when they are moving around schools and corridors and in communal spaces . " 
This comes after an outbreak at a school in Dundee , eastern Scotland , which saw 22 people test positive for Covid 19 . 
Swinney said that the new guidelines were influenced by World Health Organization ( WHO ) updated guidance . 
On Monday , WHO and UNICEF released new mask guidance divided by age groups , and said children 12 and older should be treated like adults , and follow WHO or national mask guidance as such . 
Swinney said analysis from Scotland 's own scientific advisors had also concluded that there " was a place for the use of face coverings at different stages within the education system . " 
He said that what the Scottish government had done was " essentially strengthen " WHO guidelines by expanding them to include the use of face coverings in communal areas and on school transport . 
The Education Secretary stressed that it " is not a key and single measure that we are taking , " saying a range of mitigations were being put in place to facilitate a safe return to school . 
Whilst the new measures are not mandatory , Swinney said that when he spoke to Scottish principals last week " they were very clear with me that they felt this would be a beneficial move if this was undertaken . "
