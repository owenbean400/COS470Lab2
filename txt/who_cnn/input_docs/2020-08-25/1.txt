Wild polio may have been eradicated from the African continent , but vaccination will have to continue to keep the virus from coming back – and coronavirus is disrupting that effort , a top World Health Organization official said Tuesday . 
Teams fought conflict and struggled to reach displaced people to deliver the vaccines that eradicated the virus , Dr . Matshidiso Moeti , the World Health Organization ’s regional director for Africa , said during a live event on Tuesday . 
However , the battle is not over . 
The oral polio vaccine uses a weakened but not completely inactive strain of virus that , if it circulates among incompletely immunized people , can mutate into a pathogenic form . 
Vaccination must continue to keep this strain from causing outbreaks , Moeti said . 
The Covid 19 pandemic means that some immunization campaigns are being postponed in 16 countries that are experiencing this type of polio . 
" The eradication of wild polio virus from the African region reminds us of the importance of investing in universal health coverage , in preparedness and response to outbreaks , and in making our societies more equitable , particularly for the most vulnerable among us , " Moeti said .
