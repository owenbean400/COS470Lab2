World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the rest of the world — not China — is now " our greatest concern " when it comes to coronavirus . 
For the second day in a row , the number of new coronavirus cases reported outside of China today was larger than those reported inside China . 
Tedros said China had reported 48,630 cases with 2,747 deaths . 
Outside China , there are 3,474 cases in 44 countries with 54 deaths . 
In the last 24 hours , seven new countries have reported cases for the first time , Tedros said . 
This is now the time for each country to act to contain this virus . 
" If you act now , you can prevent this virus , you can prevent people from getting sick , you can save lives , " he said .
