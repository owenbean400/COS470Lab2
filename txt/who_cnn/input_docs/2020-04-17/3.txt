The British Government is reviewing its guidance on wearing masks for the general public , the UK 's chief scientific adviser said at a briefing on Friday . 
" The evidence is quite variable around masks . 
It ’s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it , and there are not very good trials of masks , " Patrick Vallance said , adding that the government was currently following World Health Organization guidelines by not recommending the usage of face masks by the general public . 
Vallance also suggested it was necessary to keep a steady supply to medical facilities . 
" It ’s absolutely crucial that masks are available in hospitals , " he said .
