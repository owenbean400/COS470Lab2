The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says it is constantly tracking symptoms and dynamics of Covid 19 to better understand this new disease . 
Speaking during a Wednesday briefing , Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO technical lead on Covid 19 , said a global network of clinicians hold weekly discussions on what they are seeing in their patients . 
WHO pools the information and comes up with clinical guidelines " to better understand how to care for people , and to ensure that the clinical pathway that someone goes on — or is part of — in terms of how we care for them is appropriate , " she said . 
Van Kerkhove said WHO plans to have an update on its clinical guidance by the end of the week . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Program , said it ’s important to carefully track three things in order to better understand the virus — and to help make a vaccine that is the most effective . 
" We need to track the infection — the virus itself as it spreads around the world ; we need to track its transmission dynamics to ensure that we understand how it 's transmitting , where it 's transmitted , " Ryan said . 
" We need to track the genetic sequences of the virus to ensure that the virus is not evolving , " he added . 
And lastly , Ryan said , " we also have to track the clinical syndrome , to be able to check whether any changes in the virus are resulting in any differences in the clinical attack rates or clinical fatality or clinical syndromes that are presenting . "
