The coronavirus variant reported in South Africa is different than the variant causing so much concern in the United Kingdom , the World Health Organization ’s technical lead for Covid 19 , Maria van Kerkhove , said Monday . 
She said that preliminary results by South African researchers have been shared with the WHO ’s virus evolution working group . 
" They 're currently growing the virus in South Africa so that more studies can be done similar to the studies that I just mentioned about the UK , so it does sound confusing that they 're the same virus , but these are actual different variants , " she said . 
Remember : There is no evidence the new coronavirus variants are any more virulent , meaning they do not cause more severe disease . 
They do not appear to impact the effects of treatments or the protection offered by vaccines Watch :
