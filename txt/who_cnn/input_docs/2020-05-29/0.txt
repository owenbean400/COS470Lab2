Earlier today , researchers in California and Taiwan suggested that six feet of distance may not be enough to protect people from being infected with Covid 19 . 
Maria Van Kerkhove , the technical lead for the Covid 19 response at the World Health Organization , and Leana Wen , an emergency physician , joined CNN 's ongoing town hall to explain what we know about transmission so far : What is the WHO 's recommendation for social distancing ? 
The organization recommends one meter ( about 3.3 feet ) or more . 
" The longer the distance , the better , " said Van Kerkhove . 
" If you can do more , you should do more . " 
Use common sense : The six feet measure is just a rule of thumb , said Wen . 
" It 's not as if you are five feet from someone , you will get coronavirus , and if you 're seven feet you are safe . 
I think it is important for us to use common sense . " 
How does the virus transmit ? 
It 's a respiratory virus , meaning the virus travels through droplets from our noses and mouths . 
The bigger droplets tend to fall straight to the ground , while smaller droplets can stay in the air for a little longer . 
If you cough , sneeze , or sing , the droplets are being projected out and can travel — but typically , the virus is not traveling long distances through the air . 
What exactly is " close contact " ? 
When authorities try to gauge who has been exposed to the virus , they have to consider not just physical distance , but time duration and the nature of contact . 
The WHO uses a guideline of 15 minutes — but that 's quite long , and someone in a high risk environment could get infected in less time than that , Van Kerkhove said .
