The World Health Organization ( WHO ) launched a global portal Friday to share Covid 19 information around therapeutics and vaccines . 
The Covid 19 Technology Access Pool ( C TAP ) " will provide a one stop shop for scientific knowledge , data and intellectual property to be shared equitably by the global community , " WHO said in a statement . 
The pool , first proposed in March by Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado , " will ensure the latest and best science benefits all of humanity — vaccines , tests , diagnostics , treatments and other key tools in the coronavirus response — must be made universally available as global public goods , " he said . 
Tedros said C TAP has five priorities : Public disclosure of gene sequencing research , public disclosure of all clinical trial results , encouraging governments and research funders to have equitable distribution of trial data , licensing therapeutics and vaccines to both large and small producers and promoting open technology that increases supply capacity . 
WHO is encouraging companies that develop an effective therapeutic to " contribute the patent to the medicines patent pool , which would then sublicense the pattern to generic manufacturers . " 
" Science is giving us solutions , but to make the solutions work for everyone - we need solidarity , " Tedros said .
