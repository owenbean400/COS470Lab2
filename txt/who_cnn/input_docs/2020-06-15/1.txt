The World Health Organization said today that " influenza surveillance has either been suspended or is declining in many countries " during the global coronavirus pandemic – and that could have dangerous repercussions . 
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that flu season has already begun in the Southern Hemisphere , and " co circulation of Covid 19 and influenza can worsen the impact on health care systems that are already overwhelmed . " 
Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO ’s Health Emergencies Program , said there must be a " balance to ensure that we 're also able to track influenza property during that same period . " 
" We 're now entering a period in the world , where we have to be able to track both Covid 19 and influenza , " he added .
