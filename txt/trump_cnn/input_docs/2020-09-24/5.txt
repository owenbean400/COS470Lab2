Once a fixture at the administration 's coronavirus briefings , Dr . Deborah Birx has confided to aides and friends that she has become so unhappy with what she sees as her diminished role as coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force that she is not certain how much longer she can serve in her position , sources familiar with her thinking tell CNN . 
Birx has told people around her that she is " distressed " with the direction of the task force , describing the situation inside the nation 's response to the coronavirus as nightmarish . 
According to people familiar with her thinking , Birx views Dr . Scott Atlas , a recent addition to the task force , as an unhealthy influence on President Donald Trump 's thinking when it comes to the virus . 
Birx believes Atlas is feeding the President misleading information about the efficacy of face masks for controlling the spread of the virus , the source said . 
Trump , whose rallies draw crowds of supporters who refuse to wear masks , has repeatedly mocked Democratic rival Joe Biden for using them . 
Speaking from the White House briefing room Wednesday evening , Atlas claimed there is not any bad blood between himself and Birx . 
" Dr . Birx speaks for herself but that 's a completely false story and she denied it today . 
It 's completely false , " Atlas said at a news conference . 
Birx has not yet responded to request for comment on the story , despite Atlas saying she had denied the report .
