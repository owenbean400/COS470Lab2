US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn on Thursday declined to comment on statements from President Trump that the White House could override the agency if it released tougher standards for the authorization of a Covid 19 vaccine candidate . 
Some background : The FDA is considering new guidelines for the authorization of a Covid 19 vaccine , according to three sources familiar with the situation . 
The rules would allow additional time to evaluate the safety of the vaccine . 
Calculations show the rules would push an emergency authorization of a vaccine beyond Election Day . 
The President said Wednesday , " We may or may not approve " the guidelines , casting them " as a political move more than anything else . " 
In explaining his reasoning , the President said , " I have tremendous trust in these massive companies . ... 
When they come back and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works , and they 're coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with , I do not see any reason why it should be delayed further . 
Because if they delay it a week or two weeks or three weeks , that 's a lot of lives you 're talking about . " 
The FDA on Wednesday told CNN it was " respectfully " declining to comment when asked about President Trump 's statement .
