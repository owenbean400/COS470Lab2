The decision to change the criteria under which a coronavirus vaccine would get approval or be given an emergency use authorization is , under normal circumstances , up to the US Food and Drug Administration . 
And while there might be some legitimate scientific considerations to override the FDA ’s proposal , any interference that comes from outside of science is " troublesome , " Dr . Anthony Fauci said Thursday during an online conversation with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta . 
Fauci was asked about President Trump trying to make an " end run " around an FDA ’s proposal to wait at least 60 days after at least 50 % of trial participants were vaccinated to evaluate any vaccine for safety . 
Most adverse events happen within that two month window . 
" But remember there is some degree of flexibility , " said Fauci . 
" The thing that could modify that , and modify it within the scientific realm of being scientifically justifiable , is that if the vaccine is so overwhelmingly effective that you would say the risk benefit of having adverse events override the benefit of getting a 98 % effective vaccine earlier rather than waiting 60 days . 
That 's something that even we scientists would say , ' You know , we should really take a look at that ; you might want to shorten that . ' " # # Vaccines
