In an interview Thursday on WPHT ’s The Rich Zeoli Show , US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn responded to questions about the agency considering new guidelines for the authorization of a Covid 19 vaccine . 
" We 're building upon our June 30 guidance . 
This is not really new information , per se , " said Hahn . 
" What it is , is providing clarity to the developers of vaccines about what are we going to need to see to have assurances around safety and effectiveness . " 
The FDA issued guidance on June 30 about the requirements for emergency use authorization of vaccines . 
Sources have told CNN that the updated guidance would likely push approval of a Covid 19 vaccine candidate Election Day . 
" We 're trying to give manufacturers a sense of what would need to be seen in order to assure our scientists and then the American people that the vaccine is safe and effective , " said Hahn . 
" This is evolving , " Hahn added . 
" We have not seen the data from the clinical trials , and we wo not until they come to us . " 
President Trump suggested Wednesday that the FDA may be politically motivated to delay the approval of a Covid 19 vaccine , and that the White House may not approve FDA ’s guidelines . 
When asked if politics will interfere in the vaccine development process , Hahn said that the FDA ’s conversations with vaccine manufacturers are not political . 
On Thursday , Hahn declined through an FDA spokesperson to comment to CNN about Trump ’s remarks .
