During an interview on NBC â€™s Today show Thursday , US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he believes politics will not play a role in the approval of a vaccine for Covid 19 . 
" There 's an independent data and safety monitoring board that will determine , even if we see data out of these trials , according to pre specified statistical plans . 
Then the drug companies will decide if the data meets their standards , because they have their own ethical obligations . 
Then the FDA has published public transparent guidance and the tough standards they 'll require for approval , " he continued . 
Additionally , when asked if there were any concerns about a second wave of the virus , Azar pointed out that it 's an ongoing situation . 
" You know , I do not think it 's useful to talk about the second wave . 
Listen , we 're in an enduring pandemic . 
And what 's really important is that we not let down our guard as individuals , practice the three Ws : Wash your hands , watch your distance , wear your face coverings when you ca not social distance , and stay out of settings where you ca not do those things , " Azar said .
