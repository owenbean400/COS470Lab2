Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , reiterated on Wednesday that " political motivations " wo not interfere with the authorization or approval of a potential Covid 19 vaccine . 
It â€™s impossible to bypass the rigorous process used to assure a vaccine is safe and effective , Fauci told an audience at an event sponsored by the Smithsonian Associates . 
" The fact is , we 're going to see the data , " Fauci said . 
" It 's going to be transparent . " 
Fauci has sought to reassure Americans before that politics wo not play a role in the vaccine development process , despite President Donald Trump repeatedly touting that he expected a Covid 19 vaccine before the Nov . 3 Election Day .
