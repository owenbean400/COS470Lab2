Crisscrossing the country : Giuliani was in Arizona Monday , meeting with some GOP members of the state 's legislature to discuss unsubstantiated allegations that the election was fraudulent . 
He traveled to Michigan on Wednesday for a state House committee hearing that lasted four and a half hours , during which he was maskless as he pushed misleading claims that the election was stolen from Trump . 
He was at the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta on Thursday to attend a Georgia state Senate hearing on the November election . 
During a break in the hearing , Giuliani removed the mask he was wearing to greet and take pictures with supporters . 
" Feeling good " : Giuliani was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital on Sunday , a source familiar confirmed to CNN Sunday . 
Giuliani tweeted Sunday night that he was " getting great care and feeling good , " in his first public comments since President Donald Trump announced on Twitter earlier Sunday that his personal attorney had tested positive for Covid 19 .
