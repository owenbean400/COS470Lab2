Trump administration officials denied Monday they turned down an opportunity to buy more doses of the Pfizer vaccine months ago . 
The New York Times reported Monday that Pfizer had made the offer to sell the US government additional doses in late summer , but the newspaper said the administration turned it down . 
Senior members of the Trump administration ’s Operation Warp Speed spoke about the issue on a background briefing call with reporters . 
One senior administration official who did not want to be identified said the administration is " in the middle of a negotiation right now " and ca not talk publicly about it . 
" But we feel absolutely confident " that there will be a " sufficient number of doses to vaccinate all Americans who desire one before the end of the second quarter of 2021 , " the official said . 
The initial US contract , an advanced purchase agreement with Pfizer , was signed on July 22 , the administration official said . 
That agreement was for 100 million doses with the option to purchase more . 
The 100 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 50 million people , because it ’s a two dose vaccine . 
The administration said it is continuing to negotiate with several companies working on Covid 19 vaccines . 
The US has the opportunity to purchase 3 billion doses of vaccine , among all the contracts the federal government currently has with various companies . 
That would in theory be enough to vaccinate the US population several times over .
