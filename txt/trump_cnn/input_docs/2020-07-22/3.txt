Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Wednesday that wearing masks is one of the most powerful tools to combat the spread of Covid 19 , and that Americans should embrace their " personal responsibility " by wearing one . 
Redfield said he does not think a mask mandate would work , adding that he 's focusing his efforts on letting people know " they could be part of making this get better before it gets worse by wearing a face covering . 
And that 's what I 'm going to continue to do . 
I think we have clear data now that face masks work and we really know â€” the key is now how to get everybody to embrace them . " 
Remember : President Trump said he would not consider a national mandate on mask wearing in a new interview with Fox airing Sunday . 
When asked by Fox News ' Chris Wallace whether he would consider instituting a mandate , Trump responded , " No , I want people to have a certain freedom , and I do not believe in that , no . " 
Surgeon General Jerome Adams has echoed Trump , saying he does not think a national mask mandate is necessary . 
At the same time he urged all Americans to continue to wear face coverings . 
Meanwhile , a growing number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public . 
See where your state stands here .
