President Trump said there were many causes for a spike in coronavirus cases in the US , but pointed to protests specifically , saying they " presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts . " 
" There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections cases , " Trump said at a news conference Wednesday . 
" Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations , which you know very well about , which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide . " 
It â€™s notable that Trump did not directly blame the protests , but said they " presumably " caused a relations in mitigation efforts . 
Several states were also in the process of reopening when protests started , many against guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" Maybe beaches , " he continued , " four or five different listed places , we have 12 that are listed on the guide , likely also contributed . 
We 're also sharing a 2000 mile border with Mexico as we know very well and cases are surging in Mexico . " 
He went on : " Unfortunately , I was with the president and it 's a big problem for Mexico , but cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere . " 
Trump then touted his border wall , saying that , " 257 miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great positive impact on people coming in , and we have record low numbers of people coming in illegally that 's helped greatly . 
It was really meant for a different purpose but it worked out very well for what we 're doing right now and for the pandemic . "
