President Trump said he was holding solo news conferences instead of joint briefings with White House coronavirus task force members because it is a more " concise way of doing it . " 
He went on to say that he had just spoken to Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , prior to the news conference and that he gets briefed by members of the coronavirus task force regularly . 
" They ’re briefing me . 
I ’m meeting them , " Trump said when asked why he was opting to give news conferences alone . 
" I just spoke to Dr . Fauci . 
Dr . [ Deborah ] Birx is right outside and they ’re giving me all of everything they know as of this point in time and I ’m giving the information to you and I think it ’s probably a very concise way of doing it . 
It seems to be working out very well , " he said . 
On the task force in general , Trump said they are " very much involved " and touted his relationship with all members of the task force as " very good . " 
" They ’re very much involved . 
They ’re very much — the relationships are all very good . 
The relationships that we have with the doctors with everybody working on the virus — has been I think extraordinary , " Trump said .
