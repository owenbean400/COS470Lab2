US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday responded to President Donald Trump 's briefing earlier in the day , in which he warned the pandemic would probably get worse before it gets better , saying he had realized his early actions and rhetoric were in error . 
" If he had said months ago ' let 's wear a mask , let 's socially distance ' instead of having rallies ... . then more people would have followed his lead , " Pelosi added . 
" He is the President of the United States . " 
In today 's briefing that lasted around 30 minutes , Trump again said he believed the virus would disappear and insisted the American response to the pandemic was " much better " than in other places . 
But he also offered more realistic projections that his advisers hope will make him appear like a sober minded leader . 
" It will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better , " Trump said , echoing a prediction he made at the start of April of a " rough " two weeks ahead . 
Pelosi suggested that Trump ought to have taken the tone he took today in March , instead of waiting until the virus surged across the country . 
" If it 's important to wear a mask now , it would have been important to wear it in March instead of telling us that by April , we would all be going to church together , " she said . 
" I wish that were the case . "
