In the midst of comments about the timeline of a Covid 19 vaccine from both sides of the aisle , Vermont Sen . 
Bernie Sanders says the process should not be politicized . 
" Let 's not politicize this thing . 
We have developed vaccines for decade after decade after decade . 
We have to give the resources to the doctors and the scientists to do their work , " Sanders told CNN on Monday . 
Some background : This comes after President Trump said there could be a coronavirus vaccine " before a very special date . " 
While Trump did not specially mention which date , he has previously suggested that a vaccine for coronavirus could be ready before Election Day . 
But , several officials have raised questions about Trump 's timeline . 
Moncef Slaoui , the chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , told NPR last week that it ’s " extremely unlikely , but not impossible " that a Covid 19 vaccine could be authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration before the end of October . 
Dr . Larry Corey , who ’s leading a group set up by the National Institutes of Health to work on coronavirus vaccines , told CNN he also said he does not think there will be a vaccine available by Election Day .
