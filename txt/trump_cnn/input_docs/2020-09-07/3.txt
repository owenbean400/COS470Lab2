President Trump said congressional Democrats do not want to make a stimulus deal because such a deal would be beneficial to him in the November election . 
" They think it 's good for politics if they do not make a deal , " Trump said at an ongoing Labor Day news conference " They do not want to make a deal because they know that 's good for the economy . 
And if they make deal that 's good for the economy — and therefore , it 's good for me for the election in November , Nov . 3 — and therefore , they 're not going to make a deal , " he added .
