With a US death toll of more than 188,000 , Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris attacked the Trump administration for " minimizing the seriousness " of the coronavirus outbreak and failing to do enough for millions of American struggling to make ends meet . 
The unemployment rate in the United States stands at 8.4 % , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday . 
That 's down from a high of 14.7 % in April , but still far from the pre pandemic unemployment rate of 3.5 % in February . 
Harris continued to say she would not trust Trump 's word alone on the safety and efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine , but said she " would trust the word of public health experts and scientists , " including Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Trump said Friday he believed a coronavirus vaccine could " probably " come sometime in the month of October , though experts agree it is more likely to come later . 
Asked whether she believes states should mandate a vaccine for public school students along with other vaccinations , Harris said she would listen to public health experts . 
Harris also declined to back a mask mandate on a federal level , instead calling for a " national standard . " 
" This is not about punishment . 
It 's not about big brother , " Harris said . 
" We have a President of the United States who made this a partisan issue , " she continued . 
" The virus could care less who you voted for in the last election or who you plan to vote for in the next election . 
We need leadership that appreciates that , on certain issues , they should not be partisan . 
Wearing a mask certainly should not be one of them . "
