US President Donald Trump has discussed the projected number of deaths from coronavirus , saying that " hopefully we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost . " 
Trump said Friday that thanks to the steps Americans have taken as part of the 30 days to slow the spread guidelines , " we have saved thousands and thousands of lives . 
I can even make that , if you want , hundreds of thousands of lives . " 
Trump said the 100,000 figure is a " horrible number nevertheless , " and added that coronavirus " should have been stopped at the source , but it was not . " 
The 100,000 predicted deaths is a higher number than Trump has used in recent weeks -- previously , he had been predicting up to 70,000 people dying from the virus .
