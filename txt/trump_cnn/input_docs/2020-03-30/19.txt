Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told reporters on Monday that it is likely there will be another coronavirus outbreak in the fall . 
President Trump said he hopes " it does not happen " when asked about a second outbreak . 
Trump said the administration was prepared in the event the virus returns after a period of fading over the summer , after social distancing measures . 
Fauci echoed that sentiment , saying if the virus returns " in the fall , it would be a totally different ball game . " 
He said the differences would include greater testing ability at the beginning of the outbreak as well as better contact tracing when individuals fall ill . 
Fauci said the administration ’s abilities would be " orders of magnitude better . " 
" We have a vaccine that ’s on track " for development on an accelerated timeline , Fauci noted .
