The United States could see 100,000 people die of Covid 19 -- and that would not be " surprising , " said Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
" If you look at seasonal flu , we had a bad season in 2017-18 , we lost over 60,000 people just in the seasonal flu , " Fauci said . 
" This is clearly worse than that . " 
On Sunday , President Trump said that , based on models , the coronavirus outbreak could bring 100,000 to 200,000 deaths in the United States . 
" If we can hold that number down ... to 100,000 , it ’s a horrible number , maybe even less ... we all , all together have done a very good job , " Trump said , citing worst case scenario modeling that suggested over 2 million deaths . 
Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious diseases expert , previously suggested Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union " that , based on models , he thought 100,000 or more Americans could die from coronavirus . 
Easing distancing guidelines the " wrong decision " : Easing distancing guidelines at the end of the original 15 day period not only would have been the " wrong decision " but could have accelerated the coronavirus crisis in the United States , Fauci said . 
" We felt that if we prematurely pulled back , we would only form an acceleration or a rebound of something , which would have put you behind where you were before -- and that 's the reason why we argued strongly with the President that he not withdraw those guidelines after 15 days , but that he extend them , and he did listen , " Fauci told CNN 's John Berman .
