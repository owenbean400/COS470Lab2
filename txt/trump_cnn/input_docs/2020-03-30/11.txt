New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo was just asked about President Trump 's suggestion that personal protective equipment , such as masks , could be " going out the back door . " 
Cuomo said New York City has a warehouse of supplies — and said the city is creating a " stockpile " for the " high point " of the coronavirus pandemic . 
" First , there is a warehouse and that is in New Jersey , it ’s the New York City warehouse . 
We are creating a stockpile . 
For someone to say , ' well the warehouse has equipment in it , you should be using that equipment today ' — that defies the basic concept of planning and the basic operation that we have to have working not just in this state but across the country , " Cuomo said . 
He added : Cuomo said he 's not sure what Trump meant by the suggestion . 
" In terms of a suggestion that the PPE equipment is not going to a correct place , I do not know what that means , I do not know what he ’s trying to say , if he wants to make an accusation , then let him make an accusation . 
But I do not know what he ’s trying to say by inference , " he said . 
What this is about : At a briefing last night , Trump appeared to suggest , without evidence , that hospitals in New York are somehow stealing masks . 
" Even though this is different , something is going on , and you ought to look into it as reporters . 
Where are the masks going ? 
Are they going out the back door ? 
How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000 ? " he asked .
