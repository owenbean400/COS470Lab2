The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with Covid 19 . 
The drugs -- which are used to treat malaria and other conditions -- have been called game changers by President Donald Trump . 
But thus far , there is little scientific evidence that chloroquine , or its closely related analogue hydroxychloroquine , are effective in treating Covid 19 . 
What happened ? 
The authorization came in a letter dated Saturday , but the US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) acknowledged the FDA ’s action in a Sunday news release . 
The FDA limited the scope of its authorization to drugs supplied from the Strategic National Stockpile . 
The HHS announced that two pharmaceutical companies -- Bayer and a division of Novartis -- had donated the drugs to the stockpile . 
Do the drugs work ? 
In its statement , HHS said : While there 's limited evidence on the efficacy of chloroquine , or hydroxychloroquine , the FDA said the drugs ’ benefits outweighed their risk . 
In its letter , the FDA encouraged randomized clinical trials that could assess the effectiveness of the drugs . 
It also noted that the known and potential benefits outweigh the risks . 
Who can the drugs be used to treat ? 
The authorization is limited to patients who are currently hospitalized and weigh at least 50kg , or about 110 pounds . 
Under the emergency use authorization , health care providers must contact their local or state health department to access the drugs .
