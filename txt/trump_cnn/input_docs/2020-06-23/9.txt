Dr . Julie Gerberding , former director of the US Centers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , on Tuesday called for " credible " and " apolitical " experts to oversee the safety of a potential Covid 19 vaccine in order to build the public 's trust . 
There needs to be " transparency about exactly what the safety assessments are , " she said , when asked during a Senate Health Committee hearing what specific commitments the Trump administration should make to build public confidence around a coronavirus vaccine . 
Gerberding said scientific organizations including the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration should have oversight of the process . 
She also recommended the National Academy of Medicine to monitor vaccine safety . 
" When I , for example , had responsibility for administering the smallpox vaccination program for first responders , it was the National Academy of Medicine that monitored the safety of that program and helped us identify very early that there was a safety signal , " Gerberding told the committee . 
" Involving the scientific community , credible experts , apolitical in orientation , is really going to be a very important part of building this trust , " Gerberding told the committee .
