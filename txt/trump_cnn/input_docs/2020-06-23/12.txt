Dr . Leana Wen says every time she gives advice about Covid 19 on CNN , she gets hate filled and racist messages . 
Wen , a practicing emergency room physician , said she has heard from fellow Asian medical professionals that they too have faced prejudice during the pandemic . 
Some doctors and nurses have told her that patients have spit on them or refused treatment . 
" Now all of us , as health professionals , we do our jobs . 
We move on . 
We do our best . 
We internalize this . 
We do not let this bother us , as much as we can , but I think , the fact is , this does not have to be this way , " Wen said . 
In recent months , US President Donald Trump has come under criticism for his remarks , calling Covid 19 " the Chinese plague " and " kung flu . " 
Wen said that other leaders have stepped up and spoken out against racism and xenophobia . 
" Really , the President of the United States should be doing the same , " Wen said . 
The President â€™s words matter , she said .
