A group of Democratic senators is asking Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Peter Gaynor whether the agency is shipping enough personal protective equipment to staff working at nursing homes , which are epicenters of coronavirus outbreaks in some states . 
" Recent data show that approximately 40 percent of all COVID 19 deaths in the United States are residents or workers at nursing homes and other longterm care facilities , " Sens . 
Maggie Hassan , Elizabeth Warren , Bob Casey and Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to Gaynor Tuesday . 
Some background : Earlier this month , nursing homes complained they were getting defective equipment , including gowns that look more like large tarps — with no holes for hands — and paper thin surgical masks . 
In late April , President Trump announced an effort to send more supplies to nursing homes , but providers say they have not always gotten what was promised . 
" Recent public reports also indicate that some of the PPE shipped through FEMA ’s recent initiative has been defective , inadequate , and unusable . " 
The senators asked Gaynor to answer questions , including : " Are the 14 day supply shipments that FEMA and the Supply Chain Stabilization Taskforce are sending to nursing homes a one time occurrence , or does FEMA have a long term plan to distribute PPE to these facilities ? "
