Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Tuesday that he is pleased President Trump has been seen wearing a mask , adding that it is a signal " from the top " that it is important to slow the spread of Covid 19 . 
But Fauci also added he does not think a federal mask mandate will be effective . 
He 's said this in the past , too . 
" I have trust in the American people that if we put a strong emphasis on the importance of wearing masks , that we will come around and do that and get that percentage up above the relatively low percentage of people that are using masks , " Fauci said .
