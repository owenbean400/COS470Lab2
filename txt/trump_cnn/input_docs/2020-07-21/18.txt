At Tuesday 's briefing , President Trump tried to shift blame for his administration ’s delayed response to the coronavirus pandemic on his predecessor , claiming once again that he inherited " very empty cupboards . " 
Facts First : The Strategic National Stockpile was not empty before the coronavirus pandemic . 
For example , the stockpile contains enough smallpox vaccines for every American , among other medical resources . 
And while the stockpile of some critical supplies that could be used to combat coronavirus was drained and not replenished , Trump had three years in office to build those depleted stockpiles back up . 
Trump has also previously claimed the US did not have any ventilators when he took office or when the coronavirus pandemic hit . 
However , a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to CNN in late June that there had been about 19,000 ventilators in the national stockpile for " many years , " including 16,660 ventilators that were ready for immediate use in March 2020 ; the spokesperson confirmed that none of those 16,660 were purchased by the Trump administration . 
Ultimately , Trump ignored the warnings of experts and failed to restock masks and prepare other supplies to fight a potential pandemic .
