The US needs to try to get children back in school , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation ’s leading infectious disease expert , told CNN ’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday . 
" This is obviously a very important problem , you know , in general , " Fauci said . 
Fauci said he has not specifically talked to President Trump or Education Secretary Betsy De Vos about reopening schools , but he said it has come up at the coronavirus task force meetings . 
" In general , when I think about that , I want to take a 40,000 foot look and say , as a fundamental principle , I do agree that we should try as best as I possibly can to get the children back to school because of the well documented , you know , secondary downstream ripple effects that are negative on parents and on the children when you keep them out of school , " Fauci said .
