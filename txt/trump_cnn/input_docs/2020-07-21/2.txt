Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Tuesday that he still has not heard from the White House on whether or not he will be part of today 's coronavirus briefing . 
Speaking during an interview on NPR 's Morning Edition , Fauci said his attendance at upcoming briefings is " up to the White House . " 
When asked if the briefings will help the American people gain trust in the federal government 's handling of the pandemic , Fauci said that press conferences have " the potential to do that . " 
" If we during those conferences come out and have consistent , clear , non contradictory messages , I believe it would be very helpful in getting people on the track of knowing the direction that we need to go to get this pandemic under control , " Fauci told NPR 's Rachel Martin . 
" I 'm hopeful that it will be value added to our effort , " Fauci added . 
About the briefings : President Trump announced he would soon resume regular public briefings after discontinuing them in April . 
But no task force members are currently expected to join Trump at today 's 5 p.m . ET news conference , a person familiar with the plan tells CNN , who cautioned that could change . 
Trump is expected to hold these briefings a few times a week but not on a daily basis like he was earlier in the pandemic .
