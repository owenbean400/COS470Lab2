" We got Veteran ’s Choice , nobody thought that would be possible that ’s been many decades they ’ve been trying to get veterans choice , " Trump said . 
Facts First : The Veterans Choice bill was a bipartisan initiative led by Sens . 
Bernie Sanders and the late John Mc Cain , which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014 .
