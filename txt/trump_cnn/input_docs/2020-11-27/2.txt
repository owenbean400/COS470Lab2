The US Food and Drug Administration intends to make a decision about authorizing Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine within a few weeks of a key meeting scheduled for Dec . 10 , according to an agency official . 
" I ca not give you an exact date that we 're going to have an emergency use authorization issued because we have to do it right . 
Obviously we 're going to be working to do it as quickly as we possibly can , " Marks added during the event sponsored by the group Vaccinate Your Family . 
The FDA ’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , a panel of independent experts , is scheduled to meet December 10 to discuss Pfizer ’s application for emergency use authorization . 
So far , Pfizer is the only company to apply for an EUA from the FDA . 
The submission to the FDA was based on results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of Pfizer 's vaccine , which began in the United States on July 27 and enrolled more than 43,000 volunteers . 
The final analysis from the trial found the coronavirus vaccine was 95 % effective in preventing infections , even in older adults , and caused no serious safety concerns , Pfizer and Bio NTech said . 
The vaccine cannot be shipped until the FDA issues an EUA , according to a presentation by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Marks ’s timeline varies from one offered Thursday by President Trump . 
" The vaccines are being delivered literally – they ’ll start in the next week or the week after , " Trump said in a virtual Thanksgiving address to US troops . 
Vaccinations will begin in the US " towards the latter part of December , " according to Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
