In a bold , emergency action to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic , the Federal Reserve on Sunday announced it would cut its target interest rate to zero . 
The last time the Fed cut rates to zero was during the global financial crisis just over a decade ago . President Donald Trump , who has been very critical of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , praised the move as " great for our country . " 
" That brings us in line with what other countries are , " Trump said . 
" They actually have negative rates , but look , we got it down to potentially zero , so that 's a big step and I 'm very happy they did it . "
