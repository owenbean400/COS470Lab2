Over the past several days and weeks , health care and consumer industry groups and even federal agencies have sounded the alarm that the US may face major problems in keeping basic medical , food and retail supplies available during the coronavirus pandemic . 
On Sunday , the group representing food and retail companies like Clorox , Procter & Gamble and Pepsi Co told the State Department and the US Trade Representative they fear other countries cutting off exports to the US , which could exacerbate the public health emergency . 
The group is particularly concerned about countries restricting chemicals , ingredients and products they manufacture from getting to the US . 
For instance , India , a major drug ingredient supplier , has already limited exports of medications like acetaminophen , a common painkiller used for flu like symptoms , and Germany has banned the export of protective equipment like masks , gloves and suits used by health care professionals . 
President Trump also planned to speak to grocery , food and beverage corporate leaders on Sunday about supply chain concerns , including the Consumer Brand Association 's head and major grocery chain CEOs .
