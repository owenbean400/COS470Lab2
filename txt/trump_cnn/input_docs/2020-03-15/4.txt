Illinois Governor JB Pritzker expressed strong dissatisfaction with federal authorities after American travelers returning to the country were forced to wait in long lines for hours to get through customs . 
Passengers at Chicago 's O 'Hare airport told CNN they had been waiting for up to five hours in line , with no hand sanitizers in sight . 
Photos from the airport show crowds jammed together as they wait , with only a few people wearing face masks . 
Tweeting directly at President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence , Gov . 
Pritzker said the crowds at O 'Hare were " unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately . " 
" To the frustrated people trying to get home , I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this , " Pritzker continued . 
" We will do everything within our power to get relief . 
The federal government needs to get its s@#t together . 
NOW . " 
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf acknowledged the problem in a tweet , saying , " DHS is aware of the long lines for passengers who are undergoing increased medical screening requirements . 
Right now we are working to add additional screening capacity and working with the airlines to expedite the process . " 
Some context : On Wednesday , Trump suspended travel from 26 European countries to the US , starting Friday . 
The announcement sparked chaos at European airports as Americans sought ways to return home before the ban went into effect . 
Yesterday , the Trump administration expanded restrictions to include the UK and Ireland . 
Like the previous restrictions , US citizens and their family members are exempt from the restrictions but are being subjected to enhanced medical screenings upon arrival .
