Nancy Shively , an Oklahoma teacher , voted for Trump in 2016 . 
Now , amid a heated debate on reopening schools and watching the President ’s response to the pandemic , she says she fears for her life . 
Teachers will " literally be risking their lives " if they are forced to return to work when schools reopen , she added . 
" It 's a cascading failure from the President down to Oklahoma 's governor , down to school boards , till it gets to the two groups of people who ca not pass the buck , and that 's teachers and children , " she told CNN ’s Jim Sciutto . 
The pandemic will fundamentally change the way teachers provide instructions , whether it ’s in person or online , Shively says . 
" I feel that we 're conducting this vast experiment at the cost of probably health and lives of teachers and children . " 
President Trump also threatened to cut off education funding for schools if they do not reopen . 
Shively calls the pressure " cruel . "
