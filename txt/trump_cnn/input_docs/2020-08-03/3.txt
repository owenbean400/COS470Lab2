House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats want to extend the federal $ 600 unemployment insurance provisions in the next stimulus bill , adding that she is not willing to negotiate on the amount . 
She criticized Republicans for pushing for cuts to the $ 600 amount in federal unemployment insurance . 
The federal unemployment benefits have lapsed for now even as unemployment in the US continues to remain high during the coronavirus pandemic . 
It can be revived through a new stimulus package but lawmakers and the White House are as far apart as they 've ever been in talks on the next emergency aid package , sources say . 
Pelosi said that it is " absolutely essential " to reach an agreement on additional coronavirus stimulus , ahead of a meeting between negotiators this afternoon . 
Pelosi also said she does not have confidence in Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House task force coordinator , because she has not always challenged President Trump ’s claims and public remarks about the virus . 
" I do not have confidence in anyone who stands there while the President says , ‘ Swallow Lysol , it ’s going to cure your virus , ’ " Pelosi said . 
She said Birx " has enabled " falsehoods from the President .
