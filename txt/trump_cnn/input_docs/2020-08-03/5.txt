President Trump said he ’s " totally involved " with coronavirus relief negotiations on Capitol Hill despite the fact that he has not been on the Hill for the talks . 
Asked why he was not involved with the negotiations , Trump said , " The fact I ’m not over there with crazy Nancy ? 
I 'm totally involved . 
Totally involved . " 
" We are going to be doing some things that are very good because we do not think that she — look . 
What Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second , they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period time nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus or whatever you want to call it , " he continued . 
CNN considers the term " China Virus " is derogatory and inaccurate . 
" They want bailout money , " Trump claimed . 
" A trillion dollars in bailout money and people do not want to do that . 
Because we do not think it 's right . 
The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very , very bad cities and a lot of people do not want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job . 
If you look at some of the states , I wo not insult anybody by naming those states but you know what they are . 
They want bailout money . 
They 're not interested in the people they ’re not interested in unemployment . 
They ’re not interested in evictions which is a big deal . 
The evictions . 
They want to evict a lot of people are going to be evicted but I ’m going to stop it . " 
The President has routinely blamed Democrats for the status of negotiations , but Republican lawmakers spent several weeks trying to get on the same page .
