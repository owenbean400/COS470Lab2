President Donald Trump keeps downplaying the coronavirus even after it killed more than 1 million people around the world and left him hospitalized for three days . 
He has now claimed Covid 19 is " in most populations far less lethal ! ! ! " than the flu . 
That 's not true . 
Here are the facts . 
In just eight months , Covid 19 has killed more Americans than the flu did during the last five flu seasons combined . 
The novel coronavirus is also much more contagious than the flu . 
While research shows that someone with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people , someone with Covid 19 infects an average of about 2 to 3 other people when mitigation efforts such as stay at home orders or masks are not in place . 
On top of that , the coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms . 
The incubation period for the flu is much shorter , meaning people are likely to start feeling sick earlier and avoid contact with others . 
There ’s also a vaccine available for the flu and experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got flu shots . 
Even Facebook has pushed back against the claim by removing a post from Trump about the flu , but it ’s unlikely that will have any effect on the President ’s approach . 
His advice to not let the coronavirus " dominate your life " has left loved ones of Covid 19 victims furious . 
The post was hidden by Twitter for violating its rules about " spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID 19 . " 
" It not only has dominated the lives of the people we 've lost . 
It 's dominated the families of those people . 
It ’s dominated , and it still does , the hospital , the health heroes that were working every day to save my husband , the doctors , and nurses ... it 's insulting , " Amanda Kloots , wife of Broadway star Nick Cordero , told CNN . 
Cordero fought the virus for 95 days and died . 
Cordero and Kloots have a 1 year old son together .
