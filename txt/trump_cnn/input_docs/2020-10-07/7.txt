In an unprecedented move , the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday published an editorial written by its editors condemning the Trump administration for its response to the Covid 19 pandemic â€” and calling for the current leadership in the United States to be voted out of office . 
" We rarely publish editorials signed by all the editors , " said Dr . Eric Rubin , editor in chief of the medical journal and an author of the new editorial . 
The editorial , which Rubin said was drafted in August , details how the United States leads the world in Covid 19 cases and deaths . 
So far , more than 7.5 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with Covid 19 and more than 211,000 people have died of the disease . 
" Anyone else who recklessly squandered lives and money in this way would be suffering legal consequences . 
Our leaders have largely claimed immunity for their actions . 
But this election gives us the power to render judgment , " the editorial says . 
" When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time , our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent . 
We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs . " 
The New England Journal of Medicine began publishing in 1812 . 
There have been only four previous editorials collectively signed by its editors in the recent past .
