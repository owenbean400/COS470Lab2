Stocks are set for a sharp rally on Monday after the Trump administration approved a potential Covid 19 treatment . 
With Wall Street in the green , both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite could reach new all time highs . 
The US Food and Drug Administration on Sunday issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma — blood plasma taken from coronavirus survivors — to treat the virus , saying the " known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . " 
Also boosting stocks , the Trump administration is reportedly considering fast tracking an Astra Zeneca Covid 19 vaccine prior to US election , according to the Financial Times . 
Although far from a certainty , investors were hopeful that a vaccine could come faster than many had expected . 
Astra Zeneca 's stock rose 3.6 % in premarket trading . 
After months of investors saying that only a vaccine or an effective treatment solution for the virus would help the economic recovery along , it 's not surprising that the news of the plasma treatment is making waves . 
Futures for all three main indexes are sharply higher : Dow futures were up 1 % , or about 280 points Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.9 % Nasdaq futures jumped 1.1 % higher Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished Friday at record levels , so any incremental increase during this session will push them to new all time highs . 
The Dow , meanwhile , remains more than 5 % below its February record level as of Friday 's close .
