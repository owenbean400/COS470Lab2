Oklahoma Gov . 
Kevin Stitt said in a news conference today that more than 1 million requests have been made to attend President Trump 's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday . 
Stitt will be at the White House on Thursday to meet with the President prior to the rally , he told reporters . 
" I have not decided if I â€™m going to wear a mask , " Stitt said when responding to a question regarding wearing a mask while at the White House . 
He went on to say that he wo not wear one when he introduces the President at the rally . 
Stitt acknowledged that Covid 19 is in Oklahoma and they would have to learn how best to live with that . 
Some context : A judge on Tuesday denied an emergency motion to stop Trump 's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday . 
The decision came after local lawyers asked the court to block the event unless organizers agreed to take steps to adhere to the administration 's own social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of coronavirus . 
Saturday 's rally is still scheduled to take place at BOK Center , but the campaign is exploring an additional venue designed to work as an overflow location to help accommodate the overwhelming response of supporters hoping to see the President speak . 
During an interview on Fox News , Vice President Mike Pence suggested that the additional venue could be outdoors . 
Oklahoma is among at least 21 states that are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next .
