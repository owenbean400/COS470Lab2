The nation ’s top infectious disease expert , Dr . Anthony Fauci , said he personally would not attend President Trump ’s upcoming campaign rally in Tulsa , Oklahoma , Saturday . 
" No , " he answered when asked whether he would attend the event during an interview Tuesday with the Daily Beast . 
When pressed about Trump ’s planned rallies amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , Fauci told the Daily Beast that " outside is better than inside , no crowd is better than crowd " and " crowd is better than big crowd . " 
Those attending the rally are not required to wear masks , and social distancing measures will be next to impossible in the arena setting . 
This as Tulsa announced its highest daily number of coronavirus infections Wednesday , and cases are rising across the state . 
Fauci warned in a CNN interview Friday that there ’s a risk of either " acquiring or spreading " the deadly coronavirus for those who attend the rally . 
" When you are in a large crowd , if you have the congregation of people that are much , much close to each other , you definitely increase the risk that you will either acquire or spread infections , " he told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer . 
Fauci said people are going to gather , despite the warnings . 
" But the issue is , if they do , please wear a mask , all the time , because the mask will give you some protection . 
The best thing to do is to avoid crowded areas , but if you 're not going to do that , please wear a mask . "
