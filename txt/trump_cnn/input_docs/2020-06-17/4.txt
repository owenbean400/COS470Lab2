Dr . Bruce Dart of the Tulsa Health Department issued a warning ahead of President Trump 's campaign rally on Saturday : " Anyone planning to attend a large scale gathering will face an increased risk of becoming infected with Covid 19 . " 
Dart said he shared the same concerns as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding large in person gatherings . 
The CDC warns that " the more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts , the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID 19 and COVID 19 spreading . " 
He went on to say that he supports the right to assemble but asked those who are part of a vulnerable population to stay at home and to seek other ways to participate in the event virtually . 
Dart also recommended that anyone attending the rally wear a mask covering correctly , covering your nose and mouth .
