Oklahoma Gov . 
Kevin Stitt is scheduled to visit the White House on Thursday , two sources familiar with the meeting tell CNN . 
The governor 's spokesperson described the meeting as a discussion on " how to continue to partner with the federal government to help Oklahoma ’s economy and get small businesses back on their feet . " 
Oklahoma small business owners will also be in attendance , according to a White House official . 
Some context : The meeting comes days ahead of President Trump 's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday — his first large scale event since the coronavirus pandemic brought American life to a standstill . 
The director of the Tulsa Health Department said he wishes Trump would postpone the rally , citing concerns about a recent increase in local cases of Covid 19 . 
But a judge on Tuesday denied an emergency motion to stop the rally . 
That lawsuit was filed on behalf of a series of community groups and two specific individuals , who the attorneys describe as particularly vulnerable to the spread of Covid 19 .
