The federal government is stuck with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine now that the US Food and Drug Administration has revoked permission for the drug to be distributed to treat coronavirus patients . 
The government started stockpiling hydroxychloroquine donated by pharmaceutical companies in late March , after President Trump touted it as " very encouraging " and " very powerful " and a " game changer . " 
But Monday , the FDA revoked its emergency use authorization to use the drug to treat Covid 19 , saying there was " no reason to believe " the drug was effective against the virus , and that it " increased the risk of side effects , including heart problems . " 
Before the FDA revoked its authorization , the stockpile had already distributed 31 million doses . 
That leaves the Strategic National Stockpile with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine , plus another 2 million doses of chloroquine , a related drug , according to Carol Danko , a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
" HHS is working with the companies that donated the product to determine the available options for the product that remains in the Strategic National Stockpile , " Danko wrote in a statement to CNN .
