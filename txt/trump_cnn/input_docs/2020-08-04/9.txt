President Trump told reporters that he is " looking at " possibly signing an executive action if no deal is made by the end of this week on unemployment benefits but said that " progress " is being made on the Hill . 
" We are looking at it . 
We ’re also looking at various other things I ’m allowed to do under the system , such as the payroll tax suspension . 
And so we ’re allowed to do things , " Trump said in the briefing room Tuesday . 
Trump also sounded more encouraged by discussions today on the Hill saying , " We ’re talking with the Democrats . 
They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems in some of the Democrat run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management . " 
" As far as the various things that I may or may not sign — I may not have to sign . 
Progress has been made as you know , very well on the Hill . 
We ’ll see what happens , including the payroll tax suspension , " Trump added . 
It remains unclear what , if any , legal authority the executive branch has to address those issues in a substantive manner . 
Congressional aides and lawmakers , who remain in the dark on the details , are skeptical the efforts have any validity .
