President Trump said the United States ' staggering death toll from coronavirus " is what it is " in a new interview , again giving his administration credit for its response despite ongoing surges in new cases and a human toll that far outpaces that of any other nation . 
When confronted with the US ' daily death toll and Trump 's messaging on the pandemic during an interview with Axios that aired Monday night , the President grew defensive and appeared frustrated by reporter Jonathan Swan 's questions about the crisis . 
" I 've gone to your rallies . 
I 've talked to your people . 
They love you . 
They listen to you . 
They listen to every word you say . 
They hang on your every word , " Swan said . 
" And so when they hear you say , ' everything 's under control . 
Do not worry about wearing masks , ' I mean , these are people — many of them are older people . " 
" Well , what 's your definition of control ? " 
Trump replied , adding : " I think it 's under control . " 
" How ? 
A thousand Americans are dying a day , " Swan said . 
" They are dying . 
That 's true . 
And you — it is what it is , " Trump said emphatically . 
" But that does not mean we are not doing everything we can . 
It 's under control as much as you can control it . " 
Trump has frequently defended his administration 's performance to the pandemic but rarely expresses grief for the victims . 
When the US surged past 100,000 confirmed deaths in late May — after weeks of Trump projecting a toll well short of that mark — the President declined to make a public statement until the next day , tweeting about the victims amid a morning tweetstorm of insults and grievances .
