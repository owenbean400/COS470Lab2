A White House official said aides are eyeing various proposals for President Trump to take executive action in order to provide relief to US workers , should both sides in Congress fail to reach an agreement on a new coronavirus aid package . 
It remains unclear what , if any , legal authority the executive branch has to address those issues in a substantive manner . 
Congressional aides and lawmakers , who remain in the dark on the details , are skeptical the efforts have any validity . 
Where things stand : House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that she still wants a sweeping stimulus deal this week — but she made it clear she is not budging on the price tag put forward by House Democrats , reflecting how far apart the two sides are despite days of talks . 
Asked if she has an idea on the price tag she 's willing to settle for , Pelosi told CNN bluntly : " Yeah , $ 3.4 trillion . " 
That price tag has been rejected by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , who last week put forward the Senate GOP plan that would cost roughly $ 1 trillion and has attacked House Democrats ' $ 3 trillion plus bill that passed their chamber more than two months ago . 
And even some centrist House and Senate Democrats are squeamish about backing such an eye popping price tag proposed by the speaker . 
Pelosi , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have already met six times behind closed doors — and are not near an agreement on range of issues , including expiring jobless benefits and extending the expired federal eviction moratorium , according to both sides .
