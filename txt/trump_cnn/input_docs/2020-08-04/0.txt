US President Donald Trump criticized Dr . Deborah Birx in a Monday tweet after she warned the pandemic is " extraordinarily widespread " in the US . 
While Trump and other top White House officials have publicly attacked Dr . Anthony Fauci , the tweet marked the first time Birx , the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force , publicly drew Trump 's ire . 
The dust up comes as the country continues to be ravaged by coronavirus , with more than 155,000 US citizens dead and more than 4.7 million cases . 
Trump has consistently lied and misled mostly in attempts to downplay concerns about the virus as he presses for schools and businesses to reopen . 
When Trump was asked what he meant in his tweet , the President sidestepped the question . 
" Well , I think that we 're doing very well and we have done as well as any nation , " he told reporters at a press briefing Monday afternoon . 
" I told Dr . Birx I think we 're doing very well . 
She was in my office a little while ago . She 's a person I have a lot of respect for .

" And I 'm just referring to the fact that I thought that , really , they should say the job we 've done ... 
I think we 're just doing very well . " 
Birx sounded the alarms during an appearance on CNN Sunday , telling CNN 's Dana Bash on " State of the Union " that the pandemic has reached a new phase . 
She did not reject a warning by former Federal Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Scott Gottlieb that there could be 300,000 coronavirus deaths by the end of the year , saying , " Anything is possible . "
