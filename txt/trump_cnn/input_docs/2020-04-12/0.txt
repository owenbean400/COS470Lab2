An administration official told CNN that the United States government 's top public health experts agreed in the third week of February on the need to begin moving away from a containment strategy and toward a mitigation strategy that would involve aggressive social distancing measures . 
The agreement among the health officials came after they held a tabletop exercise to game out the potential for a full blown pandemic , the official told CNN . 
The public health officials had planned to urge US President Donald Trump to move toward a mitigation strategy after he returned from a trip to India , the administration official said , but that meeting was scrapped after Trump returned to Washington infuriated by a plunging stock market and CDC official Dr .
