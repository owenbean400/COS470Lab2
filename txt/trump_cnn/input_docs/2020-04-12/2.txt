Dr . Anthony Fauci said some lives would have been saved if mitigation efforts to control the coronavirus pandemic had been instituted earlier . 
Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious doctor , was responding to a question after reports that he and other federal health officials were recommending mitigation efforts like social distancing to President Trump as early as mid February . 
When asked why the President did not recommend social distancing guidelines until mid March – about three weeks after the nation ’s top health experts wanted to recommend they be put in place – Fauci said , " We look at it from a pure health standpoint . 
We make a recommendation . 
Often , the recommendation is taken . 
Sometimes it ’s not . 
But we – it is what it is . 
We are where we are right now . "
