Another 803,000 Americans filed for first time unemployment benefits last week on a seasonally adjusted basis , the Labor Department said Wednesday . 
That was a drop off from the week before but still a high number and yet another sign that the US job recovery has run into serious trouble . 
On top of that , 397,511 workers filed for benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program , which provides aid to groups that are not usually eligible for jobless benefits , such as the self employed . 
That number is not adjusted for seasonal swings . 
Added together , 1.3 million Americans filed initial jobless claims last week on an unadjusted basis . 
Continued claims , which count workers who have applied for benefits for at least two weeks in a row , stood at 5.3 million , up from the prior week . 
Congress agreed on a new round of stimulus to combat the fallout from the pandemic over the weekend . 
It would include an extension of the unemployment benefits that millions of Americans need to make ends meet . 
However , President Trump 's complaints about the bill , delivered on video via Twitter on Tuesday , raised the risk of more economic turmoil , not to mention a government shutdown . 
Trump asked Congress to amend the bill and up the amounts paid in stimulus checks .
