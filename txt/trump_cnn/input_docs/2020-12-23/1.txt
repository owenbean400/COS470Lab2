Like many of his own aides , Republicans on Capitol Hill were not given a heads up that US President Donald Trump was going to rail against the stimulus bill tonight on Twitter . 
A Republican leadership aide told CNN " no " when asked if this was expected . 
The aide pointed out that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had negotiated this bill . 
He was the White House ’s voice in the room , everyone assumed . 
Another aide said Trump seemed to be " coming unhinged . " 
The President is upset about several provisions that were actually in the omnibus spending bill , not the Covid relief bill . 
The omnibus spending bill that appropriates money for all the federal agencies for the rest of the fiscal year was combined with the stimulus bill , meaning there are numerous provisions unrelated to the pandemic relief that has also been voted on by Congress . 
Multiple sources in Congress told CNN the President 's threats would not lead to a renegotiation , given the measure was passed with big veto proof majorities . 
How this plays out is uncertain . 
It ’s possible Trump could veto the bill , but if he waits the full 10 days , it could push it into the new Congress when the Democratic majority is smaller in the House . 
The bill has not even been sent to the White House yet for his signature . 
At the moment , the hope on the Hill is he does not veto the bill since he never explicitly said he will . 
Some opposition lawmakers reacted approvingly to Trump 's calls for greater stimulus checks , and House Democrats will try to pass by unanimous consent on Thursday a bill to increase direct payments , though any one member can scuttle that effort . 
It ’s unclear what will happen when or if such a bill is blocked . 
Government funding runs out on December 28 .
