US President Donald Trump signaled he will not sign the coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress unless it amends the massive spending legislation . 
The extraordinary message came after Trump largely left negotiations over the measure to lawmakers and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin . 
It leaves the future of the $ 900 billion stimulus package and its accompanying government funding measure in question . 
Trump did not explicitly threaten to veto the bill , but said he was dissatisfied with its final state . 
The statement was filmed by the White House and was not open to the media . 
Reporters did not have a chance to ask the President questions . 
It â€™s unclear when the message was recorded . 
The President has in the past said he would sign the bill , and earlier Tuesday the White House publicly defended the proposal . 
But many of his allies have spoken out against the agreement passed by Congress .
