China 's exports ticked up 3.5 % in April compared to a year earlier in US dollar terms , according to customs data released by Beijing on Thursday . 
That was much stronger than expected : Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a 15.7 % decline . 
The increase also reversed March 's 6.6 % drop . 
Last month 's boost might have been aided by a backlog of orders that were cleared as factories reopened from coronavirus lockdown measures , according to Julian Evans Pritchard , senior China economist for Capital Economics . 
Business was shut down for a significant chunk of the first quarter as the virus forced China 's economy to a near halt . 
Evans Pritchard warned in a Thursday research note , though , that the uptick likely wo not last . 
Imports for April , meanwhile , were weak as the rest of the world contended with the pandemic . 
Data showed Thursday that imports fell 14.2 % in April , worse than the 11.2 % decline that analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected . 
Imports fell 0.9 % in March . 
The sharp deterioration in activity among China â€™s key trade partners will probably result in much weaker exports in May , according to Evans Pritchard . 
Meanwhile , the threat of additional US tariffs on Chinese goods should not be ignored , he said . 
Trade tensions are once again brewing : US President Donald Trump hinted late last week that the United States could punish China with new tariffs because of the coronavirus outbreak .
