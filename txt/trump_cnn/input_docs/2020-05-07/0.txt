US President Donald Trump has again leveled accusations that China could have stopped the global coronavirus pandemic , calling the spread " the worst attack we 've ever had on our country . " 
Speaking from the Oval Office today , the President went on to say , " This is worse than Pearl Harbor . 
This is worse than the World Trade Center . " 
What we know : So far , more than 73,000 people in America have died from coronavirus . 
In comparison , more than 2,000 Americans were killed in the Pearl Harbor bombings during World War II . 
On September 11 , 2001 , a total of 2,977 people were killed in New York City , Washington , DC and outside of Shanksville , Pennsylvania . 
But while Pearl Harbor and 9/11 were direct and targeted attacks on the United States , the coronavirus pandemic is impacting countries all over the world , including China . 
As of today , Johns Hopkins University puts China 's death toll from the virus at 4,637 . 
In recent days , Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have doubled down on the assertion that the virus originated from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan , where the outbreak was first detected last December . 
The claim has unsurprisingly drawn fierce rebuttal from the Chinese government , which described the accusation as a " smear " intended to bolster Trump 's reelection chances .
