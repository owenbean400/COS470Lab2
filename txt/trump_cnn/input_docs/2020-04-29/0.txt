President Trump has signed an executive order that mandates meat processing plants must stay open , an official said . 
Aides said the order would fall under the Defense Production Act . 
Trump had highlighted the order during an Oval Office meeting with Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis that was opened up to reporters . 
" We 're going to sign an executive order today , I believe , and that 'll solve any liability problems , " Trump said on Tuesday . 
The President signed the order after some companies , such as Tyson Foods , were considering only keeping 20 % of their facilities open . 
The vast majority of processing plants could have shut down â€” which would have reduced processing capacity in the country by as much as 80 % , an official familiar with the order told CNN . 
By signing the order , Trump has declared these plants as a part of critical infrastructure in the US . 
The administration is also working with the Department of Labor on issuing guidance about which employees who work at these meat processing facilities should remain home , including workers who are part of populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus .
