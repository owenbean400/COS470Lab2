US officials were part of the World Health Organization delegation that traveled to China in the early weeks of the Covid 19 outbreak , but they were not part of the group that traveled to Wuhan , a State Department spokesperson said . 
It is unclear why the US officials did not travel to the city at the center of the outbreak . 
CNN has reached out to the State Department for clarity . 
While in Wuhan , the WHO delegation visited the airport , a hospital , and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , including one of their labs . 
They did not visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology , according to a WHO visit summary . 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in mid April that " we still have not had Western access to that facility so that we can properly evaluate what really has taken off all across the world and how that began . " 
Although the State Department acknowledged that Americans were part of the WHO delegation , Pompeo has repeatedly called out China for denying requests from the Trump administration to allow American scientists on the ground . 
" This President and this administration worked diligently to work to get Americans on the ground there in China , to help the World Health Organization try to get in there as well . 
We were rebuffed , " Pompeo said on Thursday . 
" The Chinese government would not let it happen , indeed just the opposite of transparency . "
