President Trump outlined Monday an executive order he signed that will prohibit hoarding of medical equipment and supplies used for treating and preventing coronavirus . 
The order will " prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies , such as hand sanitizers , face masks , and personal protective equipment , " he said at the coronavirus task force briefing . 
The executive order is also meant at preventing price gouging on critical health and medical resources . 
Trump said that the Health and Human Services Department will designate certain items as " scarce " and it will be a crime to stockpile those items . 
Attorney General William Barr said the Department of Justice has seen some evidence of hoarding and price gouging on health and medical resources that were authorized under the Defense Production Act . 
Barr said the new executive order provides , " the authority to address , if it becomes necessary , hoarding that threatens the supply of those necessary health and medical resources . " 
He also said this wo not affect Americans who have stocked on toilet paper and other necessities . 
" I want to stress that we 're not talking about consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations , " he said at the briefing . 
" We 're talking about people hoarding these goods and materials on an industrial scale for the purpose of manipulating the market and ultimately deriving windfall profits . 
If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house , this is not something you have to worry about . "
