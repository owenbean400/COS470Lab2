Another week of self isolating — or , for many Americans , mandatory lockdowns — will raise more questions for President Trump on how long the coronavirus mitigation measures will last and whether they are worth the economic pain . 
Aides say Trump is itching for the guidelines to be eased at the end of the 15 day period , but realistically there are few health experts who think that ’s enough time to know whether the measures he announced last week will suffice . 
The dynamic has led to a robust internal debate over how best to balance the actual health of the country — with potentially hundreds of thousands of lives at stake — with its economic health . 
Some of Trump ’s allies have continued to publicly suggest the measures announced by the White House last week were too stringent and have caused unnecessary economic pain . 
Many of his conservative allies circulated a Wall Street Journal editorial from last week , which questioned whether the shutdown was worth the trade off of a shuttered economy . 
That has helped fuel growing opposition among some of Trump ’s advisers to an extended lockdown . 
Officials are not sure where Trump will ultimately land after 15 days — and Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious disease specialist , will continue to act as a critical voice behind the scenes . 
Trump was initially resistant to Fauci ’s recommendations that he take steps to encourage social distancing during the first go around , people familiar with the deliberations said . 
The President remains unconvinced it was the fight decision . 
And there are people around him who are not exactly reinforcing Fauci ’s message , including some of his economic advisers . 
An open question is whether Trump is willing to blow off Fauci once the economic picture becomes clearer . 
Meanwhile , Fauci has been vocal in his disagreements with Trump — Including interviews openly discussing his role in correcting the president ’s false or misleading statements .
