Vice President Mike Pence said the Food and Drug Administration has approved self collected samples for Covid 19 testing , which he said would reduce the strain on medical supplies and professionals . 
Pence said he and President Trump had asked the FDA to pursue " less invasive methods of testing " after they both endured their own tests , which require deep nasal swabs . 
He said asking doctors to perform the swabs creates a " drain on personal protective equipment . " 
Medical professionals will still perform the actual tests on the swabs that patients take and hand in at health care facilities .
