President Trump was pressed Monday about whether any of the doctors on the coronavirus task force have endorsed easing the federal guidelines . 
Trump said the doctors had " not endorsed , but we talk together and I think they ’re OK with it and I ’m OK with it . " 
" But this could be a much bigger problem . 
This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you start off with , " he added . 
Trump went on to repeat what he said earlier in the briefing that " we can do both " as in easing federal guidelines in some places to boost the economy , but still focus on certain hotspots .
