Dr . Anthony Facui , the United States ' leading expert on infectious diseases , advised people during a recent interview that they should " always tell the truth , " even if it ’s something others do not want to hear or it could cost you your job . 
" At least you maintain your integrity , " said Fauci , who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Fauci also is a member of the White House 's coronavirus task force . 
The comments come as Fauci has found himself on the receiving end of public and private criticism by US President Donald Trump . 
Fauci never mentioned Trump by name and used himself as a leading scientist as an example of how he views leadership , but his comments follow Trump ’s recent derogatory remarks about him . 
" The one thing that is so clear when you 're , you ’re a leader , you 've got to first of all be very consistent , " Fauci said in response to a question about his leadership and past role models .
