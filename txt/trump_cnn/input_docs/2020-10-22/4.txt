The United States should have a viable vaccine against the coronavirus in the " next couple of months , " Dr . Francis Collins , the director of the National Institutes of Health , said Wednesday . 
Collins said it â€™s " truly breathtaking " that a Covid 19 vaccine will have been developed in under a year given that it can take a decade to create a successful vaccine . 
Collins told the Milken panel that the development of therapeutics for Covid 19 is also moving along . 
Some of those include the antiviral drugs remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone , both of which were used to treat President Donald Trump after he was diagnosed with Covid 19 .
