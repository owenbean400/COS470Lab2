It became clear to the White House late last week that convening an in person G7 economic summit on US soil would likely be impossible by the end of June , particularly with the addition of several other countries President Trump wants to include in the meeting , people familiar with the matter told CNN . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s announcement that she would not be able to participate due to concerns over coronavirus helped cement the decision , those people said . 
In a phone call with Trump on Saturday , French President Emmanuel Macron argued that in order to convene in person , the entire group needed to be present , one western official familiar with the matter said . 
Macron and Merkel have been tightly aligned at past G7 meetings in representing European interests . 
The G7 brings together annually brings together the leaders of seven of the world ’s leading economies .
