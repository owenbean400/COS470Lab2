President Trump tweeted this morning that his son Donald Trump Jr . is doing " very well " after he tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the week . 
The President 's tweet comes after Trump Jr . posted a video on his Instagram account on Friday evening updating his followers after his positive coronavirus diagnosis . 
Trump Jr . said he has been " totally asymptomatic , " but is self isolating and following the " regular protocols . " 
He told followers he found out he was positive for the virus after getting tested ahead of a planned trip with his son . 
He later speculated that maybe the test he took was a " false positive , " adding that he would continue to follow safety protocols for now and " maybe get another couple tests " to see if he will be able to spend the holidays with his family . 
" You know take it seriously , " he said , speaking about the precautions he was taking . 
" No reason to do anything otherwise , but again totally asymptomatic , which is what â€™s weird about it . " 
Remember : Trump Jr . has spread a significant amount of misinformation about the coronavirus , including on his Instagram account . 
Late last month , he told Fox News that the number of deaths from Covid 19 is " almost nothing " at a time when 228,000 plus Americans had succumbed to the virus .
