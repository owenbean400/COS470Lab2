Despite social distancing guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say people in large gatherings should wear face masks and attempt to stay at least six feet apart , there are hundreds of black plastic folding seats linked together with plastic ties at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial amphitheater , where President Trump is expected to attend , speak and view a fireworks show tonight . 
A majority of the attendees at the venue arriving so far have not been wearing face coverings . 
There is also bleacher seating in the venue which means many spectators at the event will not have to sit in seats that are linked together . 
Some background : The 7,500 tickets for the event are lower than the typical visitor flow during the busy summer season . 
On normal days , 28,000 to 32,000 visitors come to Mount Rushmore during a 10 hour period . 
Amid the pandemic , the park never closed but visitation has been down to around 20,000 people , said Maureen Mc Gee Ballinger , Mount Rushmore 's chief of interpretation and education . 
Coronavirus cases in South Dakota currently remain stable , according to data from Johns Hopkins University , with 6,893 confirmed cases and 97 deaths as of Thursday â€” but it remains to be seen how many attendees will travel from other states . 
Thirty six states are currently experiencing a rise in new cases .
