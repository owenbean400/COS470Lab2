US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams on Friday did not directly answer when pressed on whether he thinks people should attend large gatherings during Fourth of July celebrations , such as those hosted by President Trump in Washington , DC , and at Mount Rushmore . 
" The most important thing I would say to people is if you do go out to a gathering or in public , please , wear a face covering , " Adams told NBC 's Craig Melvin . 
Adams explained wearing a face covering will actually give people more freedom because it will allow more places to stay open . 
" We 'll have less spread of the disease , " he said . 
Adams said he â€™s not opposed to mask mandates : " I think the most important thing from a health communications point of view is helping people understand how they benefit and why they should do this . "
