President Trump is set to hold a Fourth of July event at Mount Rushmore with 7,500 people and no social distancing in place tonight , which CNN medical analyst Dr . Celine Gounder calls " beyond irresponsible . " 
Trump continues to assert that coronavirus cases are rising in the US only because of increased testing . 
" This is gaslighting on an enormous scale , and it means until people eventually get sick or their family members get sick â€¦ they wo not believe it , and by then it will be too late , " Gounder said .
