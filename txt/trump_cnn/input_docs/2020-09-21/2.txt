Moncef Slaoui , head of the US government 's effort to develop a vaccine against Covid 19 , said that " we are pretty close " to having a vaccine for Covid 19 . 
In the United States , there are three vaccines in phase three trials , and a fourth one is scheduled to start imminently , Slaoui said . 
Two of the phase three trials in the US have almost fully recruited the numbers laid out in their original plans . 
" Really , the readout of these phase three trials is 50 % of the answer to the question . 
When we read out efficacy , that is going to happen somewhere between October and December , January . 
The longer we wait , the more likely , " he said . 
The reason it is not known and ca not be predicted is because it depends on the number of cases in the study , he said . 
The other 50 % of what is really important to define when the vaccine will be available is manufacturing and availability of vaccine doses , he said – something which Slaoui said is also progressing well . 
The US is investing in up to 25 different manufacturing facilities in the United States to help manufacture the six vaccines that are being supported by Operation Warp Speed . 
Small numbers of the vaccine doses are already being stockpiled that will be readily available in November and December . 
" If approval is granted around that time – or authorization – we may be able , for instance , to immunize the most susceptible populations in the US by December of 2020 , " he said . 
" Most of the elderly population and first line workers in January of 2021 , and the rest of the US population progressively in the month of February , March and April . "
