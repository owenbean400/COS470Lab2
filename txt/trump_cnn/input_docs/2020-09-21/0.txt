President Trump once again gave himself an A + in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic , despite the death toll in the United States expected to hit 200,000 Monday . 
This weekend CNN obtained audio recordings from a conversation Bob Woodward had with Trump in July in which Trump gave himself an A on his handling of the pandemic . 
Trump then claimed that if democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was in charge he would have " ran this like he did the swine flu " and " 2 to 2.5 million people would die . " 
Meanwhile , here 's a look at the latest on the pandemic in the US : Nearly 200,000 dead : The United States is closing in on the somber milestone of 200,000 deaths , according to the latest tally from Johns Hopkins University . 
The US has reported more than 6.8 million cases since the pandemic began . 
Where cases are rising : More than half of US states are reporting a rise in cases . 
Among the states reporting more new cases in the last seven days are Wisconsin , Idaho , South Dakota , Iowa and Kansas , all of which are also reporting test positivity rates above 15 % . 
The vaccine timeline : Trump claimed there will be enough vaccines for all Americans by April . 
That contradicts the CDC director 's timeline . 
Last week , he said the American public could expect to start seeing results from widespread vaccination in the second or third quarter of 2021 .
