Ohio Gov . 
Mike De Wine said his state does not have enough N95 masks to meet the demand of health care workers and first responders . 
Many people who need the masks are using them longer than they would normally use them , De Wine said . 
De Wine said he is hoping the Food and Drug Administration will give a full approval for the use of a mask cleaning machine produced by Battelle . 
The governor said he called President Donald Trump Sunday morning to express how urgently the approval is needed and said the President told him he would do all he could to get the approval . 
Trump took to Twitter to express " hope " that the " FDA can approve Mask Sterilization equipment ASAP . " 
" As per Governor @ Mike De Wine , there is a company in Ohio , @ Batelle , which has equipment that can sterilize masks quickly , " the President 's tweet continued . 
Battelle 's machine is capable of sanitizing 80,000 N95 masks a day for reuse , De Wine said .
