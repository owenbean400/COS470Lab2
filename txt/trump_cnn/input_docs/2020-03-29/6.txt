House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Sunday told CNN â€™s Jake Tapper that President Donald Trump 's " denial at the beginning " of the coronavirus outbreak cost American lives . 
She also accused Trump of fiddling in his response to the crisis . 
While Trump downplayed the extent of the outbreak , the White House coronavirus task force has in recent weeks stepped up the response including measures to get equipment to states and hospitals that need it . 
" We really want to work in a unifying way to get the job done here , but we cannot continue to allow ( Trump ) to continue to make these underestimates of what is actually happening here , " Pelosi said . 
" This is such a tragedy , we do not even know the magnitude of it because we do not have the adequate testing . "
