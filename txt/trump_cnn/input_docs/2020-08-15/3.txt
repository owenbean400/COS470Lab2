President Donald Trump once again called for college football to " come back " during a news conference at his golf club in New Jersey on Saturday . 
Trump again mentioned that he spoke to Clemson University quarterback Trevor Lawrence . who has been vocal about wanting to play this fall . 
He congratulated the SEC , ACC and Big 12 athletic conferences for planning to play this fall and said he wished the Big Ten and Pac 12 would come back as well . 
The Big Ten and the Pac 12 each voted earlier this week to postpone college football and all their other fall sports seasons . 
The five conferences , known collectively as the Power Five , generate the most revenue in the NCAA .
