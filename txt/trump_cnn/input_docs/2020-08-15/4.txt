President Donald Trump said Saturday that he disagreed with CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield 's warning that this fall could be one of the worst in US history from a public health perspective . 
Redfield reiterated a warning this week that if Americans do not follow coronavirus prevention guidelines , like wearing masks and avoiding crowds , the country could be in store for " the worst fall , from a public health perspective , we 've ever had . " 
Redfield noted that the coronavirus pandemic has been the worst public health crisis in a century and said Americans could prepare for fall by getting a flu vaccine . 
The President then praised Americans for taking the mitigation steps the CDC recommends , including wearing masks , though pointing out that views on masks changed during the pandemic . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation â€™s leading infectious diseases expert , and Redfield both changed their guidance on the importance of regularly wearing face masks as new evidence emerged .
