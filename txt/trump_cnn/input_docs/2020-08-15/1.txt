House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues on Saturday regarding the ongoing issues over the stimulus bill . 
In the letter , Pelosi criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , who recently adjourned his chamber for recess without passing a stimulus bill after negotiations between the Trump administration and Democrats broke down with both sides trillions of dollars apart on a topline cost and blaming one another for the stalemate . 
Some context : Both the House and the Senate are now in recess until September . 
If there is a deal on the stimulus , members will have 24 hours notice to return for votes . 
Pelosi also outlined Democratic priorities for a coronavirus relief bill , including funding for states and for schools , as well as for the US Post Office . 
" In the time of pandemic , the Postal System is Election Central . 
All patriots , Democrats , Independents or Republicans , should reject the President â€™s assault on the Postal System in this election season , " Pelosi wrote .
