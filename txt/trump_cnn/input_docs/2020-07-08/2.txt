The surge in coronavirus cases in Florida is creating fresh headaches for Republicans who are scrambling to raise money and quickly organize a political convention in the state after President Donald Trump abandoned plans to accept his party 's nomination in Charlotte , North Carolina . 
Florida , the site of next month 's scaled down convention , is now one of the nation 's hotspots for the virus , raising concerns about how many Republicans will travel to Jacksonville and risk transmission to witness Trump 's acceptance speech inside the city 's 15,000 seat Vy Star Veterans Memorial Arena . 
The quadrennial political conventions typically are splashy , made for TV affairs that require years of planning and tens of millions of dollars to stage . 
But the pandemic has upended plans for both political parties . 
The Democratic National Convention Committee has scaled back its August convention considerably and advised state delegates not to plan to travel to the convention site in Milwaukee . 
On the Republican side , three GOP senators -- Iowa 's Chuck Grassley , Tennessee 's Lamar Alexander and Maine 's Susan Collins -- said this week that they would skip the events in Jacksonville . 
Grassley , who at 86 is the oldest Republican in the US Senate , specifically cited concerns about Covid 19 . 
Convention organizers announced Monday they would test Jacksonville attendees daily for the coronavirus but did not provide details about the testing protocols . 
The gathering is slated for August 24-27 , with Trump likely to deliver his acceptance speech on the last day if organizers stick to the original convention schedule .
