People living in states with coronavirus surges should return to the White House 's original " phase one " recommendations on gatherings , Dr . Deborah Birx said on Wednesday . 
Citing guidelines like wearing face masks and avoiding bars and indoor events , Birx said those steps should be resumed in order to bring cases back under control . 
She said they are " asking the American people in those counties and in those states to not only use those face coverings , not going to bars , not going to indoor dining , but really not gathering in homes either . 
And decreasing those gatherings back down to our phase one recommendation , which was 10 or less . " 
Birx touted the importance of mask wearing and said " any kind of indoor gathering " should be avoided in places experiencing a spike in cases . 
President Trump has repeatedly said the economy should not be shut down again , even as cases increase .
