President Donald Trump 's new push to open schools shows he 's learned nothing from calamities sparked by his demands for premature state openings . 
The coronavirus pandemic is again rearing out of control , rising in a majority of states as a new warning comes that more than 200,000 Americans could be dead by Election Day . 
But Trump barreled forward anyway , failing to offer detailed proposals for how schools could open safely next month even as he admitted he planned to crank up pressure on governors to do what he wants . 
He also delivered a fresh rebuke to his government 's top infectious disease specialist , Dr . Anthony Fauci , who had dismissed the President 's discredited claims that the US has the world 's lowest mortality rate . 
And Trump conjured another wishful prediction : that the worsening battle against the virus , which has already killed 130,000 Americans and infected 3 million , would be far less serious within weeks . 
Schools : Trump 's self serving implication that his opponents want to keep schools closed to hurt him politically ignores the complicated concerns that administrators , teachers and parents harbor over the prospect of schools staying closed -- and the dangers that are inherent in getting classes up and running again . 
Economy : The US economy is now threatened by a second slump if the virus gets so bad that states and cities are forced back into lockdown . 
Trump 's administration falls short on all those key strategies and even now is ignoring best practices and the evidence of what worked elsewhere in a bid to crank up the economy , deemed vital to the President 's reelection hopes .
