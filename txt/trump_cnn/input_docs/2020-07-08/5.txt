The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue new guidance on reopening schools next week after President Trump dismissed their current recommendations as " very tough & expensive . " 
Speaking at a briefing by the White House coronavirus task force , Vice President Mike Pence said the new guidance would be " part of a five part series of recommendations that will give all new tools to our schools . " 
" We ’re absolutely determined to work in partnership with our states to give the guidance for states and communities to be able to safely reopen our schools , " Pence said . 
Still , he repeated a statement made a day earlier by the CDC 's director that the agency 's guidelines should not act as a barrier to reopening schools . 
" As the President made clear yesterday it 's time . 
It 's time for us to get our kids back to school , " Pence said . 
Some context : Earlier Wednesday , Trump accused the CDC of producing " very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools , " saying he disagreed with the health agency ’s recommendations .

" I will be meeting with them ! ! ! "
