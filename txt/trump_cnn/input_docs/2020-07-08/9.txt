The White House will be " very respectful " of states and local communities who determine they cannot fully reopen schools , Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday . 
Despite President Trump 's insistence that all schools reopen , and his vow to pressure governors to do that , Pence acknowledged there could be places where case counts prevent a full return to classrooms . 
" I think we would account for the fact that while we hope every school in America is able to open this fall , there may be some states and local communities that given cases or positivity in that community may adjust to either a certain set of days or certain limitations , " Pence said . 
He said the federal government would work with localities where outbreaks prevent a full return to in person schooling . 
Asked about Trump 's threat earlier Wednesday to withhold funding to schools that do not reopen , Pence noted that most education funding comes from states but said that in discussions with Congress about new funding , " we â€™re going to be looking for a way to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back to school .
