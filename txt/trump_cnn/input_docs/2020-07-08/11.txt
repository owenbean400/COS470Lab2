Dr . Bruce Dart , executive director of the Tulsa Health Department , said that there was a 20 % decline in new Covid 19 cases the week of June 28 through July 4 . 
However , he said there are high numbers being reported this week — nearly 500 new cases in two days — and the trends are showing that those numbers will increase . 
Tulsa Health Department reported 266 new cases today , bringing the total number in the county to at least 4,571 . 
When asked if the cases are going up due to the rally President Trump held on June 20 , Dart said that there were several large events a little over two weeks ago , which is about right . 
" I guess we just connect the dots . " 
Mayor G.T . Bynum said the rally along with the large " serious seven " events — such as weddings , religious events and more — informed an executive order that goes into effect tomorrow requiring events with more than 500 people to receive guidance from the health department to evaluate safety plans . 
Event organizers and health officials will work on a case by case bases to make safe decisions in relation to the event , according to the executive order .
