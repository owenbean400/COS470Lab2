New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo brushed off President Trump ’s " threat " about defunding states if governors do not reopen schools . 
" You ’re not going to bully New Yorkers . 
That ’s not going to happen , right ? " he said . 
The state spends about $ 70 billion on education each year and only $ 3 billion comes from the federal government . 
Those federal funds go to the students most in need , according to Jim Malatras , president of the State University of New York ’s Empire State College and working on the governor ’s task force for reopening . 
Expanding on potential schools reopening in the fall , Cuomo said specific district plans can be denied , accepted or districts can be asked for alterations . 
Following those decisions , the state will make a global decision as to whether any school district can reopen . 
He said it ’s possible to have a regional reopening and he acknowledged concerns about teachers ’ safety . 
Responding to a reporter ’s question about greenlighting the proposed New York City plan for reopening , Cuomo said ideally you would make the decision the night before . 
" I do not have the luxury of waiting for the night before . 
Our institutional , systemic drop dead date is the first week in August , " he said .
