The American Apparel & Footwear Association sent a letter to President Trump requesting that the administration institute federal face mask guidelines to assist retail stores as the country continues efforts to safely reopen . 
The organization , which represents hundreds of clothing and footwear companies and their suppliers , added that " with differing standards throughout the country , out members are facing situations where their employees need to educate customers on what is required to enter their stores , or even turn customers away . 
One simple , consistent standard at the federal level , mandated and enforced at the state and local level , would go a long way in addressing this confusion and keeping the economy open . " 
Versions of the letter were also sent to the heads of the National Governors Association , National Association of Counties , and the US Conference of Mayors .
