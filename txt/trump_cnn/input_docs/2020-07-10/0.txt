Dr . Robert Redfield , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , discussed tonight guidelines schools around the country should consider before reopening during the pandemic . 
These guidelines received added attention recently after President Trump , against the advice of some of the nation 's top health officials , called for schools to reopen as coronavirus cases surge across the country . 
Redfield said the guidelines " are to provide a variety of different strategies for schools to use to help facilitate the reopening of schools , " he said tonight during CNN 's global coronavirus town hall . 
The CDC guidelines for schools to reopen contain steps to keep children safe , including keeping desks to be placed six feet apart and for children to use cloth face coverings . 
The CDC suggests the closing of communal areas like dining rooms and playgrounds and the installation of physical barriers like sneeze guards where necessary . 
Redfield said that each school district should read the guidelines and see " how they can incorporate those guidances to make their school in a situation where they can reopen safely . " 
Earlier today : Redfield said schools must reopen because if they were to stay closed , it would be a " greater public health threat . " 
" I cannot overstate how important I think it is now to get our schools in this nation reopened , " Redfield said during a virtual summit hosted by the Hill . 
" The reason I push it is because I truly believe it â€™s the public health benefit of these kids . " 
The virus is not much of a threat to most children , Redfield said .
