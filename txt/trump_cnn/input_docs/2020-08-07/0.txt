A three hour meeting between senior administration officials and Democratic leaders yielded little progress tonight as both sides seemed resigned to the likelihood that Congress wo not reach a major stimulus deal amid an economic crisis . 
Both sides emerged trading blame for the sputtering talks -- and the administration officials warned that US President Donald Trump would take executive action if no deal is reached by Friday . 
It â€™s unclear if the two sides will meet on Friday . 
" We had a consequential meeting that was one way we could see the difference in values that we bring to the table , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said . 
Pelosi said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows slammed his hand on the table and stormed out of the room at one point , something that Meadows denied . 
The differences remain as they have been : Democrats want to do " something big , " in the words of Pelosi , and the Trump administration wants a " skinny bill , " in the words of Meadows . 
One of the biggest sticking points : Aid to state and local governments . 
Schumer said , " We are very disappointed in the meeting . . . They were unwilling to meet in the middle . " 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Meadows indicated they are " very far apart " on some major issues . 
" I think there 's a lot of issues we are close to a compromise position on and I think there 's a handful of very big issues that we are still very far apart , " Mnuchin said . 
Trump called the two officials three times during the meeting and urged them to continue negotiating , Meadows said . 
Mnuchin said that if " they could conclude tomorrow without a deal , " Trump will take executive action .
