It is " highly unlikely " a Covid 19 vaccine would be ready by election day , a senior administration official close to the coronavirus task force told CNN . 
The official added there is reason to be hopeful for a vaccine in the coming months as progress continues to be made . 
" There will be lots to talk about , for sure , " the official continued . 
" The trials are going very well . " 
A vaccine could come in early 2021 , around inauguration day in January , said the official who also described that timeline as " optimistic . " 
More about vaccine timing : Last week , Dr . Anthony Fauci said he is cautiously optimistic that human trials of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Moderna might show whether it ’s both safe and effective by late fall or early winter . 
Fauci — who as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases helps lead federal vaccine development efforts — has repeatedly said he hoped the vaccine could start to be available by early next year , and then widely available in the spring and summer of next year if things go well . 
President Trump on Thursday suggested a vaccine could be available by Election Day , saying he is " optimistic that it ’ll be probably around that date . "
