We 've done a great job . 
And I 'm not talking about me , I am talking about Mike Pence , the task force , I am talking about FEMA . " 
He added that he would not talk to governors if they " do not treat you right . "

I tell him , I mean I 'm a different type of person . 
I say Mike , do not call the governor of Washington , you 're wasting your time with him . 
Do not call the woman in Michigan . 
Does not make any difference what happens . 
You know what I say , if they do not treat you right , I do not call . 
He 's a different type of person . 
He will call quietly anyway , okay . 
But he 's done a great job . 
He should be appreciated for the job he 's done . "
