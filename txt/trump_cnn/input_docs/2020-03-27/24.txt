President Trump says he â€™ll hear recommendations from his team early next week on new national coronavirus guidelines as he works to reopen parts of the country . 
Trump acknowledged that places with serious outbreaks , like New York , would be unlikely to reopen anytime soon . 
But he said he would be discussing " possibly other parts of the country that really are not affected . " 
Trump suggested that the health experts on his team may not suggest any easing from the current guidelines . 
" Maybe at the advice of a lot of very talented people that do this for a living , they wo not want to do that , " he said . 
" We want to flatten the curve , " Trump said , adding : " I certainly want to get it open as soon as possible . "
