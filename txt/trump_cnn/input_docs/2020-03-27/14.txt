President Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act for the first time , requiring General Motors to supply ventilators . 
Some context : US automakers have come to the rescue when the nation has faced supply shortages during wartime in the past . 
Ford built heavy bomber airplanes and GM built amphibious assault craft , among other things . 
So it seems only natural that , in the rush to address the critical shortage of ventilators in the US due to the coronavirus pandemic , automakers would again be among the first to answer the call to help . 
Last week , Trump tweeted that automakers have the green light to make ventilators , although he stopped short of issuing formal orders to do so under the Defense Production Act at that time . 
Nevertheless , Ford , GM , Toyota and Tesla , which have all temporarily shut down their factories in recent weeks , have pledged to help . 
But switching from cars to ventilators is not so easy . 
Ventilators are complex machines that use sophisticated software and specialized parts , and companies that seek to manufacture them face several hurdles â€” including intellectual property rights , the need for specially trained workers , regulatory approvals and safety considerations .
