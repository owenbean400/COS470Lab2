As America became the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic , President Donald Trump downplayed the escalating national crisis . 
His comments at Thursday 's afternoon briefing underscored the growing duality of the fight : While the President is telling a tale of great successes , front line health care workers are facing grim scenes in hospitals in a growing number of hot spots . 
All the evidence of the virus 's advance suggests the situation is getting worse and that normal life could be weeks or months away . 
Once , Trump minimized the looming impact of the crisis . 
Now his assessments conflict with the reality of its deadly march . 
Massive jump in cases : A week ago , there were a total of 8,800 confirmed infections in the United States and 149 deaths . 
On Thursday , that figure reached more than 82,000 with nearly 1,200 deaths . 
Were those figures the result of a hurricane or a terrorist attack , their human toll would be more obvious , and it would be more difficult for the President to spin the situation . 
But as people die unseen in hospital wards and emergency rooms , the emotional impact of the accelerating tragedy is less obvious than it would be during a natural disaster . 
Trump 's contradicting message : On Thursday , a day that saw more reported deaths from Covid 19 than ever before in the United States -- Trump bizarrely turned the focus to what he said was a far lower mortality rate than he had expected . 
And despite the clearly widening spread of the pandemic , Trump intensified a push to reopen the economy , saying he would issue a relaxation of some social distancing guidelines next week . 
Any president and any administration would have been battered by combating a virulent " invisible enemy , " as Trump calls it . 
But it 's unlikely any other modern administration would spend so much time praising its own performance -- even as the crisis magnifies by the day .
