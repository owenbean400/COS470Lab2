President Trump said his administration would procure 100,000 ventilators in the next 100 days , amid fears that parts of the US are facing a looming shortage of the life saving devices . 
The President said the administration would facilitate the production or acquisition through other means of " 100,000 additional units " of ventilators over that 100 day period . 
Some context : Speaking to CNN â€™s Shimon Prokupecz on Friday , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo disputed the suggestion by Trump that the ventilators were sitting in storage needlessly . 
" So the point is , ' well they 're in a stockpile , you must not need them ' is just ignorant -- of course you do not need them today ! " 
Cuomo told CNN . 
" You need them when you hit the apex , which is 30,000 . 
We 're not there yet . " 
Earlier Friday , the President had tweeted : " Thousand of Federal Government ( delivered ) Ventilators found in New York storage . 
N.Y . must distribute NOW ! "
