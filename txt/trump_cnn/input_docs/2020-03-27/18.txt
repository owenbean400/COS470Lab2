What is happening in New York : Democratic New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo slammed Trump for his call to distribute federal ventilators the state had in storage as the two leaders ' war of words over the coronavirus pandemic escalates . 
Cuomo argued that the ventilators were stored in preparation for when New York hospitals exceed their capacity as the state has become the epicenter of the American coronavirus outbreak . 
Cuomo told CNN on Friday that Trump 's assessment of the situation " incorrect and grossly uninformed . " 
Cuomo added that his office was planning for a peak in cases " in about 21 days — that 's when we need the 30,000 ventilators , not today . " 
Trump had earlier tweeted that New York should distribute the ventilators immediately . 
That statement came hours after Trump said in a Fox News interview that he doubted states calling for tens of thousands of ventilators would need them . 
" Thousand of Federal Government ( delivered ) Ventilators found in New York storage , " Trump tweeted Friday . 
" N.Y . must distribute NOW ! "
