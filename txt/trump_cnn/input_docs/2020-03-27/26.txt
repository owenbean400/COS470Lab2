When asked whether every person who needs a ventilator could get one , President Trump did not directly respond . 
He expressed concern that ventilators could be distributed to states that do not need them and then the federal government would have a hard time trying to get those ventilators back . 
Trump once again attacked previous administrations for not having the amount of personal protective equipment now needed saying he " took over an empty box . " 
Trump did say that there are " 10,000 ventilators in stockpile . 
We are ready to go with those ventilators . "
