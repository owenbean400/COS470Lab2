Cruise line operators Carnival , Royal Caribbean and Norwegian have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic . 
But the three companies are not getting any help from Washington , D.C . , as of now . 
Shares of all three stocks plunged between 12 % and 20 % Friday after the Senate and House passed a more than $ 2 trillion coronavirus aid package that did not include any money for them . 
The reason ? 
The cruise lines all have headquarters in Miami , but none of them is legally based in the United States — which allows them to pay fewer taxes . 
Carnival is incorporated in Panama , while Royal Caribbean is headquartered in Liberia . 
Norwegian is incorporated in Bermuda . 
Republican US Sen . 
Josh Hawley of Missouri noted that fact in a tweet earlier this week , urging them to move to America in order to qualify for aid . 
President Trump said in a news briefing Thursday that " it ’s very hard to make a loan to a company when they ’re based in a different country . " 
But he also noted the cruise companies employ thousands in the United States and that " we ’re going to try and work something out . " 
Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said in an interview on the " Axios on HBO " show that the company is not looking for a government bailout . 
But Donald acknowledged that " capital markets are constrained right now . "
