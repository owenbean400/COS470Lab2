President Trump discussed invoking the Defense Production Act against General Motors during an Oval Office signing ceremony for the $ 2 trillion economic stimulus bill . 
Trump said he " did activate it with respect to General Motors and hopefully , maybe we wo not even need the full activation . 
We will find out , but we need the ventilators . " 
Trump said he has " enacted the act , and we â€™ve used it 3 or 4 times , I pulled it back 3 times because the companies came through in the end . " 
The President said a deal was in place with GM but said when that fell apart he decided to invoke the DPA . 
An earlier statement from the White House said , " Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive , but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give and take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course . " 
It continued : " GM was wasting time . 
Today 's action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives . "
