After repeatedly suggesting that social distancing guidelines could be lifted – at least in some places – in time for Easter Sunday , the Trump administration appears to have backed off that timeline . 
During a town hall interview with Fox News and subsequent one on one interview with Fox ’s Bill Hemmer , Trump raised the prospect , at one point saying there would be " packed churches all over our country . " 
Trump again floated the idea during Tuesday ’s press briefing . 
The idea was widely criticized and was not supported by any prominent politician or doctor . 
CNN 's Jim Acosta reported Tuesday that the coronavirus task force received plenty of feedback from public health experts sounding the alarm over easing the social distancing guidelines next week , a source familiar with the matter said . 
Although Trump has talked about reopening the country by Easter , the source said , the President has not reached a final decision on exactly when the government ’s guidelines would be relaxed to get the economy back up and running . 
When Trump talked up the idea of packing churches on Easter , the source continued , the president knew it was more wishful thinking than a realistic goal . 
" He was being himself , " the source said . 
On Wednesday , Trump ’s language softened : " I would say by Easter we 'll have a recommendation , and maybe before Easter , " he said at the briefing . 
By Thursday , Trump did not reference the Easter timeline at all – neither during the briefing nor his interview with Fox ’s Sean Hannity . 
Thursday night , Dr . Anthony Fauci told CNN Trump provided an " aspirational projection to give people some hope . " 
And Friday morning , Vice President Mike Pence called it an " aspirational goal " during an interview with CNBC .
