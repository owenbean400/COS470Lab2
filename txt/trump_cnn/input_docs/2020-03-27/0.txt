The Trump administration ’s Environmental Protection Agency is indefinitely dialing back enforcement of regulations and fines for companies during the coronavirus pandemic . 
The EPA announced the policy Thursday , citing worker shortages , social distancing needs and travel restrictions for both agency employees and contractors as a result of the pandemic . 
While pulling back from enforcement , EPA says it expects public water systems not to relax their standards . 
Environmental groups , who have been fighting EPA pollution regulation rollbacks since Trump took office , objected to Thursday ’s announcement . 
The administration , Mc Carthy said , " is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health . " 
The move , which is retroactive to March 13 , " does not provide leniency for intentional criminal violations , " EPA says , and does not apply to Superfund and other hazardous and solid waste management .
