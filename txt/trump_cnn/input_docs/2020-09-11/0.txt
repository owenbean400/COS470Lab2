Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , reiterated Thursday that it 's " very unlikely " a coronavirus vaccine will be made available by Election Day . 
" In fact , I would say these trials are more rigorous than ever been done for vaccines . 
Will we be likely to have results before November 3rd ? 
All of us looking at those timetables say that 's very unlikely . 
But much more likely we 'll have a readout on one of more of these , maybe in December , possibly in November . 
But late October seems beyond the likelihood that we could predict . " 
For context : President Trump told reporters Monday , " We ’re going to have a vaccine very soon , maybe even before a very special date . 
You know what date I ’m talking about . " 
Watch :
