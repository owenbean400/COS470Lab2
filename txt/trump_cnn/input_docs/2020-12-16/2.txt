President Trump wo not be administered the coronavirus vaccine until it is recommended by the White House medical team , a White House official told CNN . 
The official said Trump is still receiving the benefits of the monoclonal antibody cocktail he was given during his recovery from Covid 19 . 
Once Trump moves into a timing window to receive vaccination , he is likely to get his shot at that point , the official added . 
Trump 's situation differs from that of Vice President Mike Pence , who is set to receive his vaccination in the coming days , the official noted . 
Pence has not contracted the virus , the official pointed out , meaning his need for vaccination is more pressing . 
Pence 's vaccination is expected to be made public , the official said . 
The official went on to say Trump continues to be open to getting vaccinated . 
But the official cautioned Trump also wants to make sure frontline medical workers receive the vaccine first .
