On a conference call on Wednesday , Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell suggested that votes on final passage of a stimulus deal could slip into the weekend , and he prepared his members to be ready for that possibility . 
If votes do extend into the weekend , it 's possible there could be a temporary government shutdown until final passage of a bill since government funding runs out Friday night . 
Congress may have to pass a short term stop gap measure to prevent that from happening , but they are planning on tying a second Covid 19 relief package to the funding bill . 
Mc Connell walked his members through the outlines of the deal , indicating that direct payments would likely be included in the final proposal . 
He indicated that President Trump has been strongly advocating for direct checks . 
The struggle to get the stimulus package done also looms over the Georgia Senate runoff races that will determine which party controls the chamber next Congress . 
During the call with GOP senators , Mc Connell noted that direct payments for individuals and families have become a major issue in the race . 
" Kelly and David are getting hammered " on the issue , he said , according to a source who heard his remarks .
