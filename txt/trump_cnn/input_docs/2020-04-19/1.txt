President Donald Trump said Saturday that there " could be a difference " in how authorities enforce social distancing guidelines at mosques versus how they do at churches . 
This was in a response to a question regarding a post by conservative author and political commentator Paul E . Sperry he retweeted today . 
Trump said that he spoke with both imams and rabbis but claims that " politicians treat different faiths differently . " 
Farhana Khera , executive director of Muslim Advocates , called Trump ’s remarks " insulting and frustrating on the eve of Ramadan … our president chooses to use his energy and platform to amplify the hateful words " of the original tweet . " 
" As is often the case , the President is yet again stoking anti Muslim hate and sowing division at a time when he is failing to do his job , " Khera said . 
Asked if he thought mosques might not follow the social distancing guidelines , Trump responded , " I do not think that at all . 
I 'm somebody who believes in faith . 
It matters not what your faith is . 
But politicians treat different faiths differently . 
I do not know what happened with our country . 
But the Christian faith is treated much differently than it was , and I think it 's treated unfairly . " 
The retweet ignores the fact that President Trump is pushing for states to ease social distancing guidelines if they are ready to do so , and for weeks has been pushing for some of those restrictions to be lifted by May 1 . 
Ramadan will be observed between April 23 and May 23 this year .
