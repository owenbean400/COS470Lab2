The US needs to conduct at least 500,000 tests for Covid 19 a day to safely open the economy and stay open , according to three Harvard researchers . 
Currently , about 150,000 tests per day are completed , and about 20 % of those have been positive . 
More testing is necessary to properly understand who is infected and might put others at risk , researchers said . 
The current percentage of tests that come back positive in the US is too high , researchers said . 
The World Health Organization has suggested that the positive test rate should be between 3 % and 12 % , while the US rate is around 20 % . 
To achieve a 10 % test positivity rate by May 1 , about 580,000 people per day would need to be tested , research shows . 
The researchers include : Dr . Ashish Jha , faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute Dr . Thomas Tsai , a surgeon at Brigham and Women â€™s Hospital in Boston and researcher at the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health Benjamin Jacobson , research assistant at the Harvard Global Health Institute Jha wrote in an email to CNN that a formal write up of their research will be available soon . 
" If we ca not be doing at least 500,000 tests a day by May 1 , it is hard to see any way we can remain open , " the researchers wrote . 
President Donald Trump told reporters the US has conducted more than 3.78 million coronavirus tests to date at a Friday White House briefing .
