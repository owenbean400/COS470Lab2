President elect Joe Biden said " there 's a lot more that has to be done " when it comes to distributing any possible coronavirus vaccine . 
The Trump administration has " clued us in on their planning on how they plan to distribute the vaccine to the various states , " Biden said . 
" But there is no detailed plan that we 've seen , anyway , as to how you get the vaccine out of a container into an injection syringe into somebody 's arm . 
It 's going to be very difficult for that to be done and it 's a very expensive proposition . " 
Biden said he agrees with prioritizing first responders , nursing home residents and health care workers , but there also " has to be some equity in the way this is distributed . " 
Biden called Covid 19 ’s effects on Black and Latino populations a " mass casualty event . " 
He said delivering the vaccine to " major drug chains does not get you into a lot of these neighborhoods , and it does not guarantee that it gets around , so we ’ve got a lot of work to do . "
