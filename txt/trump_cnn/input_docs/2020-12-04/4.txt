An update from an influential University of Washington model paints a staggering picture of Covid deaths in the coming months -- and suggests that even a rapid vaccine rollout wo not reduce that number by much . 
The update from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) Friday morning projects 538,893 Americans could die from coronavirus by April 1 . 
The model suggests daily deaths will peak in the range of 3,000 in mid January before gradually falling . 
How vaccine developments could affect that : The data suggest that a " rapid vaccine rollout " would still mean about 527,704 deaths by April 1 -- a reduction of only about 11,000 . 
The model covers primarily the period before vaccines are expected to be widely available to the public . 
Why masks are still so vital : Far more impactful , the model suggests , would be universal mask wearing . 
The model argues that over 66,000 American lives could be saved . 
On the other end of the spectrum , the modeling shows deaths by April would soar to 717,229 if safety mandates are dropped and not renewed as cases rise . 
US President elect Joe Biden told CNN 's Jake Tapper on Thursday that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office -- in marked departure from President Donald Trump 's approach to the pandemic . 
Despite the continued spread of Covid 19 in the US , there continues to be resistance to wearing masks . 
At an Oval Office ceremony on Thursday , few people were wearing them , according to reporters who were in the room .
