Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that household gatherings have become a " major vector " of coronavirus spread . 
At last night ’s debate , President Trump again said the US is " rounding the turn " in the coronavirus pandemic . 
Thursday was the highest day for new infections since late July . 
Azar said the President is " trying to give people hope " while acknowledging " we are in a very serious moment . " 
Azar was pressed if the administration could take a more aggressive approach to the virus and why Trump continues to hold rallies without social distancing . 
" In public health , we focus on mitigation fatigue , " Azar said . 
"… When you look back , we actually hit that curve at just about the right point to achieve the core strategic objective , which was to flatten and delay that curve . 
… We 're seeing the impacts here and in Europe from mitigation fatigue . "
