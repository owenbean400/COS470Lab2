President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said during an Oval Office meeting on Friday that some significant differences between the Trump administration and Democrats still need to be resolved before reaching a stimulus deal . 
Asked for an update on the stimulus talks , Mnuchin told reporters , " The President ’s been very clear in his instructions to me . 
That if we can get the right deal we ’re going to do that . " 
The President , speaking from the Resolute Desk for an announcement on the normalization in relations between Israel and Sudan , claimed that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi " wants to bail out poorly run Democrat states . " 
" We just do not want that . 
We want Covid related , " Trump said , later adding , " We do not want to reward areas of our country who have not done a good job . " 
The President also asserted that Pelosi wants to wait until after the election to strike a stimulus deal . 
" I do not think she wants the people to get the money before the election , " Trump said . 
Meanwhile , Pelosi on Friday continued to express optimism about a potential coronavirus stimulus package , saying negotiators " could be very close . " 
" We ’re writing the bill , and hopefully we ’ll be able to resolve some of the differences , " she said during an interview on MSNBC . 
" I think the President wants a bill . 
I really do , " she said , adding that it ’s still possible lawmakers could approve the legislation before the election , depending on how the GOP Senate reacts . 
" We could be very close , " Pelosi said . 
" As I say , we ’re close enough to put pen to paper . "
