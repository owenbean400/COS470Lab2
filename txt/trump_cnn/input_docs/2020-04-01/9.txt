House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Democrats are aiming to pass a fourth coronavirus response bill when — " God willing , coronavirus willing " — Congress returns at the end of April . 
Pelosi and other Democratic leaders said Wednesday that they want a potential fourth coronavirus response bill to include their infrastructure framework , which would cost $ 760 billion over five years . 
This money would go to community health centers , clean water upgrades , expanded broadband access , roads and bridges , and rail and other forms of public transit . 
" We must take bold action to renew America ’s infrastructure , " Pelosi said . 
" We need to invest in our infrastructure to address some of the critical impacts and vulnerabilities in America that have been laid bare by the coronavirus . " 
Democrats said they are especially concerned about rural , low income areas that may be hit hard by the pandemic and economic fallout . 
Rep . 
Jim Clyburn , the Democratic Whip , said that Covid 19 has " exposed some significant faults , " like how many Americans do not have access to internet , which many kids need to continue their studies during the pandemic . 
President Trump has recently called for a $ 2 trillion infrastructure package to boost the economy , a move Democrats have praised as they seek to craft the next pandemic related infrastructure package . 
" Actually , he ’s right , " Rep . 
Peter De Fazio , who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure committee , said of Trump ’s comments . 
" For once I agree with him on a step he wants to take . "
