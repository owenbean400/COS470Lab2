House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell " should not try to hide behind an excuse " in response to the suggestion from both the President and the Kentucky Republican that impeachment distracted the US government from the growing coronavirus crisis . 
" We have a life and death situation in our country and they should not try to hide behind an excuse for why they did not take action , but it does admit that they did not take action , " Pelosi said , adding , " Right now we have to work together to get the job done . " 
Some context : In an interview on Tuesday with radio host Hugh Hewitt , Mc Connell said that the crisis " came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial . 
And I think it diverted the attention of the government , because everything , every day was all about impeachment . " 
During a press briefing on Tuesday , Trump echoed that argument , saying that impeachment " probably did " distract him from responding to the coronavirus outbreak . 
" I think I handled it very well , but I guess it probably did ( distract me ) , " Trump said . 
" I mean , I got impeached . 
I think , you know , I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it . "
