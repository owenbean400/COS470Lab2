President Trump said he wo not issue a national stay at home order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases . 
The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states depending on how bad individual states situations might be . 
" You have to look â€” you have to give a little flexibility . 
If you have a state in the Midwest , or if Alaska for example does not have a problem , it 's awfully tough to say close it down . 
We have to have a little bit of flexibility , " Trump said . 
Some context : Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the 30 days to slow the spread guidelines should be viewed as a national stay at home order on Wednesday morning . 
" My advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay at home order . 
There are guidelines that say , look , the more we social distance , the more we stay at home , the less spread of disease there will be , " Adams said .
