President Trump said learning about the " severity " of the novel coronavirus led to his recent shift in tone away from comparing the virus to the flu as he did in the early days of the pandemic . 
The President was asked about the unnamed friend whose struggle with the virus Trump has cited at least twice in previous briefings . 
Trump has said this friend slipped into a coma . 
" Also the violence of it — if it hits the right person , and you know what those stats are , if it hits the right person that persons in deep trouble . 
And my friend was the right person , " Trump said . 
The President stopped short of saying his friend ’s condition was a turning point in his view of the virus , saying his view shifted due to the data he was presented . 
" But it hit him very hard . 
He ’s strong , very strong kind of a guy , but he ’s older , he ’s heavier and he ’s sort of central casting for what we ’re talking about , " Trump said .
