The Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships are expected to arrive and remain off the coast of Florida early Thursday while they wait for clearance from US authorities , according to a statement from Holland America . 
The company made a plea to President Trump , Florida authorities and the public to be allowed to arrive to Florida . 
The cruise line called the status on the ships a " humanitarian situation . " 
Four people on the ship have died and at least eight people have tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Since March 22 , 97 guests ( 83 on Zaandam and 14 on Rotterdam ) and 136 crew on the Zaandam have exhibited flu like symptoms , according to the statement . 
About 45 guests have mild illness and are unfit to travel . 
These passengers would stay isolated on board until they recover , per the press release . 
Holland America says less than 10 people need immediate critical care onshore and it has secured a local health system to treat them . 
" This small number is the only group that will require any support from medical resources in Broward County and is necessary to prevent further harm to their health , " Holland America said in a statement
