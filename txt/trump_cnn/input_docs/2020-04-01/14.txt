When asked if the US Strategic National Stockpile is nearly depleted , President Trump told reporters " It is . 
We are sending it directly to hospitals . " 
Trump went on to echo statements he made yesterday that the federal government wants supplies to be directly shipped where they are needed , rather than sitting in a warehouse . 
Some context : The Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory , depleting the bulk of its protective gear , a source familiar told CNN earlier today . 
The official added that the stockpile was never meant to serve as the only source of protective gear for the entire coronavirus response and they said the states would need to get more supply from the private market .
