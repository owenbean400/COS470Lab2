After President Trump toured the headquarters of Puritan Medical Products in Guilford , Maine , on Friday , the facility discarded the swabs it produced during his visit , according to a company statement issued Tuesday . 
This decision was made in advance , the company said , due to the number of individuals who would be present , including government officials , security and the media . 
The company added that it " conducted the type of full facility cleaning that was necessary " after the visit , and that all swabs it produces for Covid 19 testing purposes are also sterilized post production . 
Puritan said it also decided in advance that it would shift Friday ’s production schedule to the weekend , " which allowed for no production loss . " 
Puritan Medical Products has not responded to CNN 's multiple requests for comment . 
The White House declined CNN 's request for comment . 
In his remarks Friday , Trump recounted how in April the administration dedicated $ 75 million in Defense Production Act funding to boost the company ’s output . 
Because of this , Trump said the company " will soon double " the number of foam tip swabs it manufactures to 40 million per month , and down the line that figure is expected to reach 60 million .
