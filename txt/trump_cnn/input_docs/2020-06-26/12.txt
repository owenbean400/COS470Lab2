Contrasting some of the optimistic messaging coming out of the Trump administration in recent days , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said it may be time to " drop back a few yards " to think about the original reopening guidelines . 
He had a stark message for anyone comfortable with the risks of Covid 19 : " A risk for you is not just isolated to you because if you get infected , you are part , innocently or inadvertently , of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic . " 
Fauci began his comments at the White House coronavirus task force briefing by admitting that some states may have opened too soon . 
" So , we 're not going to say blame we 're not going to try and analyze it , " he continued , " but there is something that 's very important about it , that I 'd like to get a message to the country in general . " 
Fauci said it may be necessary to think about the original guidelines from the task force about reopening the country , some of which were ignored by the states . 
" When the vice president went back , pulling back a couple of months ago , when we showed about the guidelines to safely reopen the country , we 've got to make sure we drop back a few yards and think about that , that this is part of a process that we can be either part of the solution or part of the problem . " 
" We need to take that into account because we are all in it together , " he said . 
" And the only way we 're going to end it is by ending it together . "
