The White House announced Thursday that US Vice President Mike Pence would lead a public coronavirus task force briefing Friday morning , the first public meeting in almost two months . 
The announcement comes as many states are seeing a resurgence in cases of Covid 19 , as others like Oklahoma and Texas are seeing fresh spikes . 
The briefing will take place at the Department of Health and Human Services , according to the schedule released by the White House . 
US President Donald Trump has tried to declare that the pandemic is " over , " despite the rising numbers and has instead focused his administration 's energy on reopening the economy . 
He has also resumed campaign rallies , despite warnings by health experts on his own task force that the events could be super spreaders of the virus . 
At his Tulsa , Oklahoma rally Saturday , eight members of Trump 's advance staff tested positive for the virus , and since then the Secret Service has announced that agents who attended the rally will be quarantining for the next two weeks . 
Campaign staffers who attended the rally are also quarantining .
