Vice President Mike Pence said it 's up to state and local governments to issue guidance and orders on face masks . 
Asked if he had a message to Americans about the importance of wearing masks , Pence said " people ought to listen to their state and local authorities . " 
While a handful of states require people to wear masks in public , many others have not issued any guidance . 
Some individual cities and counties have also issued orders to require facial coverings . 
Pence said he 's in contact with many state and local leaders , and said he 's assured them that he will urge Americans to follow local directives . 
" In some cases , there 's statewide guidance with regard to facial coverings and with regard to events and gatherings . 
In other cases , there 's specific county wide or city wide directives , and we just believe that what 's most important here is that people listen to the leadership in their state , the leadership in their local community , and adhere to that guidance , " Pence said . 
Face masks — which has been proven to be an effective way to stop person to person spread of coronavirus — has become a contentious topic .
