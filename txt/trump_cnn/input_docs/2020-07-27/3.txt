Vice President Mike Pence assured that any coronavirus vaccine that makes it to market will be safe — but he did not detail how the administration plans to convince the American public of that . 
He added that the Food and Drug Administration is applying the " highest standards to the development of this medicine . " 
" As we go through the trials , as we see the results of this and other versions of the vaccine , the American people will see the carefulness with which we are approaching this , " Pence said . 
Pence was asked during a news conference at the University of Miami about recent polls that suggest some Americans would not get a Covid 19 vaccine because they do not trust it , and his answer did little to address how the administration plans to change that . 
FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn went on to detail how the FDA is speeding up development of a vaccine without compromising safety . 
" I think it ’s important to understand that the reduction in time with respect to the development has a couple of different aspects to it , " Hahn said , explaining how the vaccine trials had been compressed . 
He also said that FDA is doing a " real time review . 
We ’re not just waiting for the end of the trial , we ’re reviewing in real time so that we can look at the data in real time and then come to a quicker decision at the end of the trial . " 
Hahn said the FDA was also " maintaining regulatory independence " from President Trump 's Operation Warp Speed . 
" One thing I can promise you is the great scientists at FDA , incredible expertise they have , they will call the balls and strikes on this one and they will do it based upon our gold standard of efficacy and safety , and they will do it to the benefit of the American people , " Hahn said .
