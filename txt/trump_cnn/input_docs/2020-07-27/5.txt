President Trump is touring a Fujifilm vaccine lab facility in North Carolina and is wearing a mask , which are required at the facility . 
As CNN has reported , Trump recently shifted to encouraging mask wearing after months of refusing to be seen doing so in public during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Earlier this month , Trump tweeted an image of himself wearing a face mask and indirectly called the act " patriotic . " 
The move to publicly wear a mask has been primarily motivated by floundering poll numbers , a source familiar with the President 's thinking told CNN .
