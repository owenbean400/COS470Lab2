More than 3,700 people are stuck in Yokohama , Japan , on a cruise ship that became a floating quarantine zone after dozens of people onboard tested positive for the coronavirus . 
Among them is Spencer Fehrenbacher , an American citizen and masters degree student in Tianjin , China , who wanted to celebrate the Lunar New Year with his friends on the ship . 
Now , he 's confined to his cabin , spending his time reading and watching TV . 
Passengers in interior cabins are allowed out for about an hour and a half , but have to wear masks at all times and stay one meter away from each other , he said . 
Then Fehrenbacher learned an additional 41 people were diagnosed with coronavirus . 
Eventually , 70 people total on the ship would test positive . 
Newlyweds Milena Basso and Gaetano Cerullo are also on the ship . 
But instead of enjoying the honeymoon they 'd saved up for over two years , they 're worried about staying healthy and being trapped for longer than 14 days . 
" We just do not feel like we 're safe , " Basso told CNN . 
" We should be quarantined in a sanitary environment that 's safe , not on a cruise ship that 's already infected . " 
" Donald Trump , save us , " Basso said . 
" Get us a government based airplane . 
Get us off the ship . "
