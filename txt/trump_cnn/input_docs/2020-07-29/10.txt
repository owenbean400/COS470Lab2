After President Trump reiterated his demand today for money for a new FBI building , and criticized GOP opposition to it , Senate Majority Whip John Thune , a Republican from South Dakota , told CNN 's Manu Raju : " They ’d have to make a better argument than what I 've seen so far . 
I do not think there 's a lot of support from our members . " 
Trump told reporters as he left the White House earlier on Wednesday that a new FBI building has been in the works " for many years , " and that he thought the funding should stay in the stimulus bill . 
Pressed by CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins on the fact that Republicans do not want it in the bill , Trump said , " Then Republicans should go back to school and learn . 
We need a new building . " 
Some background : Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell made it clear on Tuesday that he opposes including the funding for a new FBI building in any final negotiated product for the next coronavirus stimulus . 
That 's despite the fact that the Senate GOP stimulus proposal formally unveiled Monday includes funds for a new FBI headquarters at the request of the Trump administration . 
The bill includes $ 1.75 billion " for the design and construction of a Washington , D.C . headquarters facility for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , " according to the text . 
Pressed by a reporter on Tuesday over the funding , Mc Connell responded by saying that he 's against " non germane " provisions in the next stimulus . 
The Senate majority leader indicated that he hopes that anything not directly related to Covid 19 will be stripped out before a new relief measure is enacted .
