AFL CIO President Richard Trumka decried the Republican stimulus bill proposal , as benefits for millions of Americans are set to expire Friday . 
The AFL CIO is the largest federation of unions in the US , representing about 12.5 million workers . 
Trumka said that he sees no evidence of unemployed Americans taking advantage of the $ 600 benefit to not find jobs instead . 
GOP senators slammed the administration for including $ 1.75 billion in the bill to build a new FBI building . 
Trumka also said that Trump is pressuring workers to return to potentially unsafe conditions . 
" What the Republicans do in this bill is they do not give a standard . 
That means essential workers are going to continue to get infected and continue to die . 
â€¦ It 's the absolute wrong thing to do in a pandemic , " he said . 
Trumka also alleged the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of being absent during the pandemic , saying that there have been 6,000 complaints but only two violations since February .
