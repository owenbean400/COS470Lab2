President Trump signaled he may be interested in a short term bill as negotiations on Capitol Hill have largely stalled . 
Trump said the negotiation team is working to extend the eviction moratorium . 
" We want to work on the evictions , so people do not get evicted . 
We work on the payments to the people . 
And the rest of it we ’re so far apart , we do not care . 
We really do not care . 
We want to take care of the people . 
The Democrats are not taking care of the people . 
The payments are not enough , " Trump said . 
Mnuchin said they are going to wait until Friday regarding the possibility of a short term bill , and that Trump is focused on evictions and unemployment insurance . 
" We want to take care of them now , the rest we can discuss later , " Trump added . 
Trump defends FBI building money : Trump was asked about a $ 1.75 billion provision in the bill for a new FBI building . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell and other Republicans have voiced opposition to the measure . 
Trump said that a new FBI building has been in the works " for many years , " and he thought it was " crazy " that they would consider moving it to the suburbs of Virginia or Maryland . 
" I ’m very good at real estate , so I said we ’ll build a new FBI building , either a renovation of the existing or even better , we ’ll get a new building . 
So we have that in the bill , it should stay , " Trump said . 
Pressed by CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins on the fact that Republicans do not want it in the bill , Trump said , " Then Republicans should go back to school and learn . 
We need a new building . "
