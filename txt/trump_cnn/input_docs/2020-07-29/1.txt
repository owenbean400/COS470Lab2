US President Donald Trump says his relationship with Dr . Anthony Fauci is " very good " but wonders why the doctor 's approval rating is so high when his is so low . 
Speaking a day after he retweeted a message claiming Fauci had misled the public , Trump chalked up his own sinking numbers to his personality . 
But he said Fauci 's broad respect should transfer to the Trump administration -- for whom Fauci works . 
" I get along with him very well and I agree with a lot of what he ’s said , " Trump insisted . 
Trump continued : " And he ’s got this high approval rating . 
So why do not I have a high approval rating with respect -- and the administration -- with respect to the virus ? 
We should have it very high . " 
" So it sort of is curious , " Trump said , " a man works for us , with us , very closely , Dr . Fauci and Dr . Birx also , very highly thought of -- and yet , they ’re highly thought of , but nobody likes me ? " 
" It can only be my personality , that ’s all , " he concluded .
