US President Donald Trump defended his tweets in support of hydroxychloroquine saying that the drug is still " very positive " and called a doctor who was spreading conspiracy theories on Covid 19 in a now deleted video " very impressive . " 
When discussing the video that he retweeted Monday night featuring a group of doctors making false claims related to coronavirus , Trump said the thought were " very respected doctors . " 
The video , published by the right wing media outlet Breitbart News , featured a group of people wearing white lab coats calling themselves " America 's Frontline Doctors " staging a news conference in which one speaker who identifies herself as a doctor makes a number of dubious claims , including that " you do not need masks " to prevent the spread of coronavirus , and that recent studies showing hydroxychloroquine is ineffective for the treatment of Covid 19 are " fake science " sponsored by " fake pharma companies . " 
Trump shared multiple versions of the video -- which was deleted by Twitter , Facebook and You Tube -- with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night despite the claims running counter to his own administration ’s health experts . 
When pressed by Collins on this fact , Trump abruptly ended the news conference . 
But Trump once again stuck by his defense of hydroxychloroquine , telling reporters about his tweet : " I was not making claims . 
It ’s recommendations of many other people including doctors . " 
A study found that neither hydroxychloroquine alone nor hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin appeared to affect the condition of patients at the 15 day mark . 
Additionally , unusual heart rhythms and elevated liver enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin , according to the study .
