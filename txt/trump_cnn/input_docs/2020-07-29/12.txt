The US could see coronavirus related deaths skyrocket " well into the multiple hundreds of thousands " if there is not a course correction , according to a warning from the Association of American Medical Colleges . 
" We ’re not on a good path at present , " AAMC chief scientific officer Dr . Ross Mc Kinney Jr . told CNN ’s Brianna Keilar . 
Mc Kinney also said that the crisis is putting a strain on hospitals , especially those in virus hotspots like Arizona , Florida and Texas . 
The AAMC is calling for an increase in critical supplies , as well as improving testing , reopening schools safely , expanding health insurance and developing a vaccination distribution protocol . 
The association is urging the Trump administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to address supply shortages . 
" Essentially everywhere is short of the critical supplies and we as a country have not attempted , systematically , to upgrade our production of either PPE or of the supplies that are needed by the laboratories in order to meet the demands we have for testing . 
The demands we have for PPE , " Mc Kinney said . 
Mc Kinney added , that the AAMC is calling for national standards for local stay at home orders and reopening protocols . 
Each city or state " do not necessarily have to have the same degree of lockdown , but they should use the same criteria to try and move from one phase to the next , so that we can learn what are the best standards to use , so we do not get these continuous waves of infection , " he said .
