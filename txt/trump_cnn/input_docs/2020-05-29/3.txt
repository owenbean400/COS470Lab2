The World Health Organization said it has no comment regarding President Trump â€™s announcement that he would be cutting ties with WHO . 
On Friday , a WHO spokesperson said in an e mail to CNN , " We have no comment to offer at this point . " 
Earlier this month , Trump sent WHO an ultimatum saying he would cut funding if WHO did not " commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days . " 
On Friday afternoon , Trump said WHO " failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms , " adding that the US would be " terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving , urgent global public health needs . "
