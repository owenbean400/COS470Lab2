" Chairman Alexander , Chairman Shelby and Chairman Blunt are finalizing an ambitious package of funding and policy to help our schools reopen . 
They will lay out a reopening related funding package for schools and universities north of $ 100 billion . 
That â€™s more money than the House Democrats proposed for a similar fund , " Mc Connell said , adding , " there will be several important policies to help childcare providers , grant new flexibility to elementary and secondary schools and more . " 
Mc Connell previewed other components of the plan , saying that " Republicans want to send a second round of direct payments to American households , and Senator Collins and Senator Rubio have crafted a sequel to their historic and incredibly successful Paycheck Protection Program . "
