The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it is sending $ 5 billion to nursing homes and state veterans ’ homes to fight the growing coronavirus epidemic . 
The money can be used to hire additional staff , implement infection control , increase testing and provide additional services , such as technology to allow residents to connect with their families . 
The infusion comes from the provider relief fund contained in the $ 2 trillion coronavirus relief package that the US Congress passed in late March . 
It ’s in addition to the $ 4.9 billion nursing homes are receiving to offset revenue losses and to respond to the pandemic . 
Nursing home staff must complete an online training program for a facility to receive the new funds . 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will also start requiring nursing homes in states with a 5 % or greater coronavirus positivity rate to test all staff each week . 
This was previously a recommendation . 
The administration announced last week that it is distributing rapid testing devices to nursing homes , which had complained that they do not have the money to conduct so many tests . 
More than 15,000 devices will be deployed in coming months , with more than 600 shipping this week . 
The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living ( AHCA/NCAL ) said Wednesday that the increased funds are " a significant step forward , " but more is needed , especially in light of the surge of cases around the country . 
" It is equally important for Congress to provide an additional $ 100 billion for the HHS Provider Relief Fund , which is accessible to all health care providers impacted by COVID 19 , " said CEO Mark Parkinson .
