President Trump called on Congress to pass $ 105 billion for schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill at a news conference on Thursday . 
He said the money would be used to support measures like smaller class sizes , teachers aides , rearranging spaces for social distancing and masks . 
But , if schools do not open , Trump said the money should " follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions . " 
Trump said it 's important for schools to reopen so parents can go back to work and individual families should be able to make decisions that are best from them , adding that reopening schools is not political . 
" I hope local leaders put the full health and well being of their students first and make the right decision for children , parents , teachers and not make political decisions . 
This is not about politics , " Trump said .
