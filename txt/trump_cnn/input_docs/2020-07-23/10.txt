Supplemental guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on safely reopening schools during the pandemic could be released as early as tonight , two federal officials told CNN . 
A senior administration official said that five supplemental guidance documents have now been completed and described their release as " imminent . " 
Some background : Earlier this week , CNN reported that the supplemental guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cleared though the federal review process by the Office of Management and Budget . 
The White House initially said this guidance would come out last week , but a CDC spokesman confirmed late Friday that it would be delayed because the documents were not ready . 
President Trump had criticized current CDC reopening guidance as " too tough . " 
A federal health official also confirmed the timetable to CNN , and , reacting to previous delays in this process , the source said : " I will believe it when I see it . " 
Many school districts in the U.S . are set to resume classes in some form as soon as two weeks from now .
