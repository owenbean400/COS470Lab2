Award winning chef and restaurateur Marcus Samuelsson , head chef of Red Rooster in Harlem , said that Congress needs to pass a $ 120 billion grant to keep restaurants in business during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Despite bipartisan support , the Restaurants Act has not been taken up by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell . 
" Are we going to not have those favorite restaurants in our neighborhoods ? 
Those are like the heart and soul of the neighborhoods , and really we need Congress to pass this $ 120 million bill , " Samuelsson said on CNN ’s " New Day . " 
The chef commended volunteers and community members for banding together to help restaurants , but he said that now it is time for political leaders and President Trump to act . 
As the pandemic has affected Americans ’ jobs and the ability to feed their families , Samuelsson partnered with Audible 's Newark Working Kitchens to deliver more than 200,000 meals since March . 
Samuelsson said it ’s a model that can be implemented across the country . 
The meal delivery service works with the New Jersey city 's government , restaurants and donors to get food out to residents and first responders , hire back workers and order food from farmers , he said .
