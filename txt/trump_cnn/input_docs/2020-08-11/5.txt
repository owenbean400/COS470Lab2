In response to President Trump 's executive order asking states to contribute 25 % of additionally weekly unemployment aid , Ohio Gov . 
Mike De Wine said the state does not have " the ability to do that . " 
" We ’re looking at an economy that , while we ’re optimistic about it , is coming back , our unemployment has gone down . 
We hope it will continue to go down . 
But we also know that we are facing Covid , we ’re still fighting the Covid . 
We know what impact that has on the economy and so , you know , there ’s no money in the unemployment fund to do this , " De Wine said at a news briefing on Tuesday .
