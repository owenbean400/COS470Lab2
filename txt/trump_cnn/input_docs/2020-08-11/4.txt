The director of the National Institutes of Health says he will " make a big noise " if President Trump were to pull an " October surprise " and pressure the US Food and Drug Administration into approving a vaccine prematurely in order to get votes on Election Day . 
" This just cannot be allowed to happen , " Dr . Francis Collins told CNN . 
He said if FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn allows approval of a vaccine based on flimsy evidence , " he ’s got a lot of people he ’d have to answer to . " 
The fear that the US Food and Drug Administration might approve a Covid 19 vaccine without sufficient safety and efficacy data in order to please the President was first put forth publicly in a June New York Times opinion piece by two physicians at the University of Pennsylvania . 
Some background : There ’s a precedent for Trump declaring a product safe and effective without any proof . 
For months he has said that hydroxychloroquine is both , even though high quality studies have shown it does not help coronavirus patients and could be harmful . 
" It did not go so well for HCQ did it ? " 
Collins said , using an abbreviation for the drug . 
" Do we really need to be reminded of how important it is to make those decisions based on evidence ? " 
Collins said he , Dr . Anthony Fauci , and others would " certainly make a big noise about not supporting [ the vaccine ] " if the FDA were to approve it prematurely , adding that the vaccine cannot be approved " on the basis of anything other than science . "
