President Donald Trump has once again tweeted that Congress should pass a Covid relief bill , saying it should be " big and focused , " which seems to combine the Democrat and Republican wants from an additional stimulus package . 
" Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill . 
Needs Democrats support . 
Make it big and focused . 
Get it done ! " 
Trump tweeted Saturday morning on the way to his golf club in Virginia . 
On Thursday , Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell continued to reject the call from Democrats for a big coronavirus stimulus package , saying , " that 's not a place I think we 're willing to go " and reiterated his push for a bill that 's " highly targeted at what the residual problems are . " 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer signaled during a news conference earlier on Thursday they 're not willing to change their call for a large coronavirus package even as efforts to negotiate remain stalled . 
Meanwhile , Trump -- who once called on Republicans to accept " a big , beautiful " stimulus in hopes it would boost his election prospects -- is now consumed by the fallout of his defeat . 
The White House 's lead stimulus negotiator , Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin , has taken a step back from the talks , and all eyes are on Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , who had been on the sidelines of the negotiations throughout the summer and fall .
