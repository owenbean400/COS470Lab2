President Donald Trump said he wo not issue a national stay at home order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases . 
The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states , depending on how bad individual states ' situations might be . 
" You have to look -- you have to give a little flexibility . 
If you have a state in the Midwest , or if Alaska for example does not have a problem , it 's awfully tough to say close it down . 
We have to have a little bit of flexibility , " Trump said . 
Some context : Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the 30 days to slow the spread guidelines should be viewed as a national stay at home order on Wednesday morning .
