The Trump administration will no longer ship personal protective equipment to allies overseas as the United States grapples with shortages of critical medical supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
A congressional source told CNN Wednesday that they were informed late last Friday night that the coronavirus task force -- led by Vice President Mike Pence -- was stopping overseas shipments of the medical equipment and instead asking that the supplies be distributed within the US . 
Asked about reports of the freeze on Wednesday , President Donald Trump said there was " no truth whatsoever " to them . 
However , minutes later , he noted that " whatever we have , whatever we 've committed to , we commit , " but added " we also need a lot for ourselves . " 
Politico was the first to report on the freeze . 
CNN has reached out to the State Department and US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) for comment .
