President Trump announced a new set of guidelines for nursing homes to combat coronavirus in addition to previous guidance from the administration that instructed nursing homes not to allow medically unnecessary visitors . 
Trump said the administration would recommend " all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently " to help prevent the spread of COVID 19 . 
In addition , the President said the administration would recommend that nursing homes " designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents . " 
Trump said this is a practice that health agencies were likely to continue recommending " long into the future . " 
His guidelines come after more than 140 nursing homes across the country have been hit by Covid 19 .
