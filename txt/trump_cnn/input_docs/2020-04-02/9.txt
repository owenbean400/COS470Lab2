House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the creation of a new bipartisan House select committee on the coronavirus crisis that will exercise oversight of the federal response to the pandemic and be chaired by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn . 
The speaker told reporters Thursday on a conference call that the committee 's immediate focus will be on " the here and now , " not the Trump administration 's initial response to the pandemic , though she said there will come a time when such a review will be appropriate . 
She said the committee will " have an expert staff and the committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to coronavirus and to ensure that the taxpayers dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives , deliver relief , and benefit our economy . " 
Pelosi said the committee will be able to exercise oversight and would have the authority to issue subpoenas . 
" It 's no use having a committee unless you have subpoena power , " Pelosi said . 
" We would hope there would be cooperation , " she added . 
" We want to make sure there are not exploiters out there . "
