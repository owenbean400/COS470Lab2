Tensions between these historic democratic allies that have been simmering since Trump came to office three years ago have now come to a boil during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Covid 19 has shocked the world by the speed of its spread , but it is also accelerating another global change in the balance of power -- and not in America 's favor . 
US and China : Despite Trump 's early hailing of Xi Jinping 's handling of the pandemic , he has since blamed the Chinese President for covering up the early stages of China 's outbreak .
