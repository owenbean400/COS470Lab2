There ’s no substantial disagreement between President Trump and the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the timeline for a coronavirus vaccine , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Thursday . 
Fauci said Trump and CDC director Dr . Robert Redfield were " essentially " right Wednesday when they each gave what seemed like a different timeline for a potential coronavirus vaccine said Fauci , who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Redfield told a Senate hearing that it would likely be the second or third quarter of next year – that means late spring or summer – before widespread vaccination could be underway in the US . 
Asked about this during a news conference later in the day , Trump said Redfield " made a mistake " and was " confused . " 
He said a vaccine will be available soon , possibly as early as next month . 
Fauci did not see a big conflict . 
Fauci also addressed Trump ’s claim that a Covid 19 vaccine would be available next month . 
" What the President was saying is that it is entirely conceivable that we will have an answer by October , " he said . 
" My projection is that it would likely be November or December . 
We do not know . 
We 're just going to have to wait to see . "
