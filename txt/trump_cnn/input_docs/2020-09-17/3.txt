US President Donald Trump 's political interference in the scientific and ethical process underwriting the quest for a Covid 19 vaccine -- on stunning display on a chaotic Wednesday -- is deepening the damage of his disastrous pandemic response .

The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had told lawmakers it could be fall 2021 before there are sufficient vaccine stocks to allow normal life to resume . 
He also said masks work . 
The President 's undercutting of Redfield came in a week in which he has repeatedly rejected the best advice of health authorities , including by holding an indoor campaign rally . 
He 's also challenged the science of global warming as historic fires rage in Western states .
