During a meeting at the White House on Monday , President Donald Trump pushed pharmaceutical company heads on when they ’d be able to deliver a coronavirus vaccine , but experts at the table repeatedly emphasized that a vaccine ca not be rushed to market before it ’s been declared safe for the public . 
The pushback was most visible during an interaction toward the end of the meeting . 
" I do not know what the time will be , " Trump said . 
" I ’ve heard very quick numbers , that of months . 
And I ’ve heard , pretty much a year , would be an outside number . 
So I think that ’s not a bad range . " 
But Dr . Anthony Fauci , the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , clarified the timing for the President : Fauci added the vaccine may be deployable within a year , or year and a half , at the earliest .
