Washington Gov . 
Jay Inslee advised residents to stay home more in order to avoid the spread of novel coronavirus . 
Washington is the only state in the United States so far where people have died as a result of coronavirus . 
There are six confirmed fatalities out of 18 total cases in Washington . 
Inslee said he has the power to declare an emergency and force large events to be canceled , but he does not think that step is necessary right now . 
The governor also said he has the ability to call up the National Guard if needed to assist medical teams and provide security . 
Inslee says he discussed the possibility of eventually using military assets in a phone call with Vice President Mike Pence , the head of the Trump administration ’s coronavirus task force . 
Four of the people who died of coronavirus were residents of a single nursing home , Life Care Center in Kirkland . 
Officials have not speculated about how those patients may have been infected , but Washington Secretary of Health John Wiesman tells reporters , " If I have a loved one in a nursing home or a hospital , I should not go visit them if I ’m sick . "
