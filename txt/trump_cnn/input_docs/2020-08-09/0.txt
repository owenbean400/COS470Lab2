President Donald Trump on Saturday signed executive actions , one of which would provide $ 400 a week in federal enhanced unemployment benefits after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach an agreement on a United States Coronavirus stimulus relief bill this week . 
" I 'm taking action to provide an additional or extra $ 400 a week and expanded benefits , $ 400 . 
That 's generous but we want to take care of our people , " Trump said at his golf club in Bedminster , New Jersey . 
Trump signed one executive order and three memoranda , one of which will enact a payroll tax deferment for Americans earning less than $ 100,000 a year . 
He also proposed to extend an eviction moratorium and defer student loan payments and forgive their interest . 
Trump said the federal government will pay $ 300 , leaving it up to the states to pay the remaining $ 100 . 
He did not outline where the federal funds would be coming from . 
Trump also took the opportunity to criticize the Democrats , saying , " We are doing that without the Democrats . 
We should have been able to do it easily with them but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people . " 
Democrats are likely to challenge the executive actions in court . 
Trump first laid out the executive orders at a hastily called news conference on Friday at his New Jersey golf club , where he said he was not concerned about the legality of the actions he promised .
