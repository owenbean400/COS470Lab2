House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNN this morning that her advisers are telling her that President Trump 's proposed executive actions are " absurdly unconstitutional . " 
Pelosi responded to comments made in an earlier interview on CNN with Larry Kudlow where the Trump economic adviser clarified that the President 's proposal to give out of work Americans $ 400 a week is contingent upon states agreeing to provide $ 100 . 
Kudlow said that the federal government would then kick in the additional $ 300 . 
Pelosi said these comments by Kudlow show the " weakness and meagerness in what the President proposed , " adding that the states do not have this money .
