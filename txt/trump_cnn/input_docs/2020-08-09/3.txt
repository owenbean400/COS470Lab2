President Trump â€™s directive regarding student loans seems to be the one executive action of the four he took Saturday which will deliver the results the administration hopes . 
This is the only area of the four , the others being mortgage relief , unemployment aid and a payroll tax holiday , most under control of the Trump Administration and which does not need Congressional funding action , state governments or the private sector to fully implement . 
The memorandum on student aid Trump signed Saturday directs the Education Department to extend the student loan relief granted in the CARES Act until the end of the year . 
Some context : Currently , payments are paused and interest is suspended on federally held student loans until September 30 . 
Democrats have pushed for extending the relief for another year and making private student loans eligible . 
In March , Trump waived student loan interest by executive order and the administration said borrowers could request a deferment on their payments . 
Congress later codified that policy into law and took it a step further by automatically suspending monthly payments .
