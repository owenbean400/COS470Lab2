Mansicalco said the State Department had told passengers they could trust the Japanese government and would not face another quarantine once they returned home . 
" It was repeated over and over and then a few days before I get off this boat you are going to , say , just kidding , 14 more days for you , " she said . 
" It is like a prison sentence for something I did not do . 
And I am furious . 
I am really really upset . " 
She is self employed as a realtor , so the extended period away from work is " detrimental . "

" Bring us back home , test us and then if we do not have the virus , then you need to let us go . 
We 've done our time . "
