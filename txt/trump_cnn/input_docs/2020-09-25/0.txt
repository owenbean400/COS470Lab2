The Trump administration â€™s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization will hurt the United States , WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in an interview with Time posted Thursday . 
" Withdrawing from WHO actually hurts the US , because being part of WHO is not just to help those who need support , " said Tedros . 
" The US also benefits from being a member of WHO . " 
Tedros told Time that when first heard that the United States was withdrawing from WHO , he did not believe it . 
He said he had a " very cordial " conversation with President Trump on March 23 , in which there was no hint that the US was planning a withdrawal . 
Tedros said the consequences of the decision are still unclear . 
" I do not see the membership or the relationship with the US as a financial transaction . 
It 's not the money which matters . 
It 's actually the global leadership of the US , " Tedros said . 
He noted that when battling the coronavirus pandemic , nations are stronger together . 
" One of the impacts which may be visible is , you know , the global solidarity is weak . 
Major global powers are not working together , " Tedros said .
