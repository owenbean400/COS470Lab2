CNN 's Wolf Blitzer sparred with senior advisor to President Trump , Jared Kushner , on Monday asking him if he still believed the federal government 's coronavirus response represented " a great success story for the federal government " as the President 's son in law claimed back in April . 
" I will just press you Jared , a thousand Americans dying every day is not a success , right ? " 
Wolf Blitzer asked . 
Kushner touted the administration 's response and pointed to " a very strong rebound " in the US economy . 
" You want to keep that number as low as possible , " Kushner said , in response to Blitzer 's question . 
" One American dying everyday is too much but if you look at where we were back in April we had 2,500 Americans dying a day … But if you look at the case fatality rate obviously it ’s gone down . " 
Kushner predicted back in April that " by June a lot of the country should be back to normal " and said he was hopeful that " by July the country 's really rocking again . "
