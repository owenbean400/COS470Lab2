President Trump has ordered his negotiators to halt negotiations over a new stimulus package . 
" I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when , immediately after I win , we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business , " he tweeted . 
Trump tweeted shortly after a private conference call with Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , House GOP Leader Kevin Mc Carthy and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , the administration ’s top negotiator . 
The decision to pull the plug on the talks is a major blow to Americans still struggling with the fallout from the once in a century pandemic and endangers an economic recovery that for months was driven by the initial $ 2.2 trillion stimulus passed by Congress in the spring . 
With that money largely spent and gone , economists have warned more support is imperative in the months ahead . 
While Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were still far apart on a final agreement , according to multiple people involved , they were still very much in negotiations – with the two scheduled to talk by phone on Tuesday afternoon and having continued to trade paper and legislative text over the last several days .
