The US Food and Drug Administration made clear Tuesday it will want to see two months of follow up data after volunteers get their second dose of a vaccine as part of clinical trials testing potential coronavirus vaccines . 
That would make it difficult , if not impossible , for any vaccine maker to apply for emergency use authorization by Election Day , as President Trump has tried to promise , or by the end of October , as the CEO of Pfizer has hinted . 
The agency posted documents for an Oct . 22 meeting that has long been scheduled for vaccine advisers to meet and discuss requirements for either emergency use authorization or a full biologics license application for any potential coronavirus vaccine . 
The document also outlines other advice for companies seeking FDA consideration for emergency use . 
It is the first detailed document describing what should be included in applications in order to issue an emergency use authorization for a vaccine . 
The agency said it wants to make sure any vaccine is safe before giving authorization to deliver it to millions of people . 
" In general , FDA ’s guidance documents , including this guidance , do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities . 
Instead , guidances describe the Agency ’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations , unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited . 
The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended , but not required , " the documents read . 
FDA officials have been clear in saying they want to have conversations with vaccine makers , rather than laying down strict rules that must be followed , for providing emergency use authorization for any vaccine .
