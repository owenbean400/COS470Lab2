The head of the Food and Drug Administration division that approves vaccines said Monday he expects to see at least one company seek emergency authorization for a coronavirus vaccine before the end of the year . 
" I think it 's possible we 'll see something before the end of the year in terms of an emergency use authorization application from some company , " Dr . Peter Marks , director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) at the FDA , said in a You Tube interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association . 
Five companies have Covid 19 vaccines in Phase 3 trials , the largest and most advanced stages of human testing , in the US . 
Two of them started in July , so it ’s conceivable they could have enough data by the end of the year to ask the FDA to consider emergency authorization , Marks said . 
He said the FDA is sticking to a requirement that companies follow volunteers for an average of eight weeks after they get their second dose of vaccine to make sure it ’s safe . 
Marks said staff are trying to filter out political arguments as they focus on data from clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers . 
The FDA ’s requirements for an emergency authorization are less strict than for a full Biologics License Application . 
The process for an EUA will take weeks , while the process for a BLA takes months , Marks said . 
FDA officials have repeatedly said they will not skimp on safety considerations for a coronavirus vaccine , even as President Donald Trump repeatedly said a vaccine could be ready by Election Day in November .
