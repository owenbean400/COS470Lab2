New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy confirmed that the state will pursue a " hybrid model " for the November election . 
It will be up to voters to decide if they would like to vote by mail or in person , according to Murphy . 
New Jersey used a similar model for its primary election on July 7 . 
" It was a success . 
Not perfect , but overwhelmingly a success , " he said . 
President Trump has attacked mail in voting as fraudulent , despite no widespread voter fraud in US elections . 
In the New Jersey city of Paterson , four people , including a city councilman , were charged with voting fraud related to the May 12 municipal election . 
" I â€™m pretty sure that we have a higher probability of being hit by lightning than we do uncovering voter fraud , " Murphy said .
