No one knows for sure . 
President Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months — but scientists say it 's too early to tell . 
" The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of ( novel coronavirus ) in warmer , wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools ... it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent , " wrote Dr . Marc Lipsitch , director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard 's T.H . Chan School of Public Health . 
US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar responded to Trump 's suggestion that coronavirus could weaken in warmer weather . 
" What the President is saying is , we hope it will respond the way regular coronaviruses do and be heat responsive , " Azar said . 
" But it also could just as equally respond the way SARS — a coronavirus adaptation — responds and continue in the warm season . "
