The Trump administration is considering a delay in the April 15 tax filing deadline as a response to the coronavirus , two people familiar with the plans said . 
The idea has been discussed among White House and Treasury Department officials over the past few days , the people said . 
The IRS would likely extend the deadline by at least several months or waive fees associated with late filing . 
Last week , when asked about the notion of delaying the deadline , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers it was not under consideration . 
But since then , the White House has heard from some allies , along with public statements from certain Democrats , that extending the deadline could be a way to reduce the economic fallout from coronavirus . 
The possible delay in the deadline was reported earlier today by the Wall Street Journal .
