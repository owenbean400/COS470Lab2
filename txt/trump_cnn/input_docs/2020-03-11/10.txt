President Trump will lay out a " path " out of the coronavirus crisis , a source familiar with the Oval Office address told CNN . 
Trump is expected to explain that " the crisis is not America 's doing but America is taking the proper course , " according to the source who was read in on some of the language in the address but cautioned that the remarks are still being tweaked . 
The President 's expected description of the crisis , the source said , is an indication that Trump will likely note that the virus was first detected in China . 
Trump made note of this during his meeting with banking executives earlier today . 
The source said the White House is hoping Trump will come across as something of a " CEO " in the speech . 
But the source noted this is a critical moment for Trump . 
A White House official says Trump will outline his economic stimulus proposals and will look to put forward a message of " unity " in the face of this crisis . 
The President is expected to address the nation at 9 p.m . ET .
