President Donald Trump says it will be safe to reopen the country when " we can say we have to be on that down side of that slope . " 
" We can do it in phases , go to some areas where â€” you know , some areas are much less affected than others , " he said at a Wednesday coronavirus task force briefing . 
" But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country , or certainly most of our country . " 
CNN reported earlier Wednesday that discussions are underway at the task force level about how to reopen the US economy . 
Trump said he believes the US is " ahead of schedule " in efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus . 
" You hate to say it too loudly because all of a sudden things do not happen . 
But I think we will be sooner rather than later , " Trump said . 
" But we 'll be sitting down with the professionals . 
We 'll be sitting down with many different people making a determination , " he went on . 
" And those meetings will start taking place fairly soon . "
