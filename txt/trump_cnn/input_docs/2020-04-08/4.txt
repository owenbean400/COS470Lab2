As the United States hit another record for most deaths from coronavirus in a single day , President Donald Trump said the country was " way under " any coronavirus models . 
The US has recorded at least 398,809 coronavirus cases , including 12,895 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Some 30,613 new cases and 1,909 deaths were reported on Tuesday . 
The President , who seemed to be taking what could turn out to be a premature victory lap , said that New York " is getting ready , if not already , getting ready to peak . " 
Trump also said that he would love to start the economy back up " with a big bang , " opening the entire country to business all at once . 
But he said the administration is also considering opening up in sections . 
Ventilators and hospital beds : President Trump also said his administration was right about its estimates for hospital beds and ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients . 
Over the weekend , the President cautioned that there could be a shortage of ventilators available to Americans . 
" I mean , it could be you have shortages , and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need , " Trump said at the time . 
On Tuesday morning , Surgeon General Jerome Adams appeared on the NBC Today show warning that the federal stockpiles of medical supplies are inadequate for dealing with this type of epidemic alone .
