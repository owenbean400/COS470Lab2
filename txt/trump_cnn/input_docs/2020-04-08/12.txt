House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with NPR Wednesday that the chamber would not have unanimous support to approve the Senate ’s version of a measure to add $ 251 billion in funding to a small business loans program established by the $ 2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package last month . 
Democrats have called for additional funding for hospitals , state and local governments , and food stamps to be passed alongside the small business loans funding . 
" The White House says they do not support that , but we do , " Pelosi said . 
Asked about President Donald Trump ’s removal of the inspector general who had been tasked to oversee the implementation of the CARES Act , Pelosi said what Trump is doing " is so very , very wrong . " 
" We cannot allow this to happen without a bright light shining on it , " she said of rolling out the aid package . 
Pelosi said the committee on the coronavirus crisis that Democrats plan to launch later this month will seek to prevent waste , fraud , abuse , profiteering and price gouging . 
" This is not an offense to the President . 
It 's about how big money attracts some kind of profiteering and price gouging and the rest , " she added of the committee ’s purpose .
