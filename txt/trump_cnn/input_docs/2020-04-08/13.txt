The Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday announced a second major purchase of ventilators , buying more than 43,000 ventilators from the manufacturer Philips for $ 646.7 million . 
The ventilators will go into the national stockpile , which gets distributed across the country , in chunks . 
Philips will make a first delivery by the end of May of 2,500 ventilators , the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement . 
The company will deliver a total of 43,000 ventilators by the end of the year . 
The major purchase comes hours after the department announced a similar contract for the auto company General Motors to make ventilators . 
The contract with Philips , a company that was already a major presence in building ventilators , comes under the Trump administration 's announcement to use the Defense Production Act to get more needed supplies to aid the fight against the coronavirus epidemic . 
HHS said it will award five other companies contracts under the DPA . 
Frans van Houten , CEO of Royal Philips , issued a statement , saying Philips is " actively collaborating with the U.S . government to help save lives in the U.S . and across the globe . " 
" There is an unprecedented global demand for medical equipment to help diagnose and treat patients with COVID 19 , " van Houten said . 
" We welcome the support of the U.S . government in our efforts to aggressively increase the production of hospital ventilators . 
We believe in fair allocation of scarce medical equipment to those who need it the most , and we are ramping up to deliver 43,000 units to the most critical regions in the U.S . in the coming weeks and months through December 2020 . "
