Tuesday evening saw US President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden take to the stage for the first presidential debate of the 2020 campaign . 
The event quickly went off the rails and the global pandemic was among the many topics the two clashed over . 
Biden criticized Trump 's handling of the crisis and his failure to produce a health care plan . 
In turn , Trump openly said the vaccine process is political and mocked Biden for wearing a mask . 
The scaled down audience at the event also brought the health crisis into the debate hall . 
And Biden made multiple references to the 200,000 Americans who have died . 
Instead of a robust defense of his record , Trump sought to claim a hypothetical President Biden would have done worse . 
But despite Biden 's attempts to inject the health crisis back into the discussion , the debate devolved into arguments and bickering that ultimately did not center on Covid 19 , which has now killed 1 million people .
