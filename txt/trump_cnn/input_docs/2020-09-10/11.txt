House Speaker Nancy Pelosi panned Republicans ’ pared back coronavirus relief bill on Thursday ahead of a procedural vote to advance it in the Senate . 
She went on to further criticize the legislation : " I think that Mc Connell is being his cynical self by saying , ‘ I ’ll just put something on there to look like we ’re trying to do something — while we ignore the needs of the American people , while we shy away from defeating and crushing the virus , while we say to people at their kitchen tables , we do not care if you do not have food or if you ’re out on the street in another month and the rest of that . 
But just to say I put something there . ’ " Pelosi also continued to rule out addressing coronavirus stimulus in an upcoming government funding package . 
" Those negotiations are separate from this , " she said . 
She reiterated that Democrats and the Trump administration agree on pursuing a clean continuing resolution to keep the government running ahead of a Sept . 30 deadline . 
She did not provide details on timing for the continuing resolution — if it will last a full year or if it will be shorter than that . 
She said negotiators will figure out timing in the days ahead .
