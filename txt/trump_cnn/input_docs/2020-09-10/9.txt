Admiral Brett Giroir , the assistant secretary for health with the Department of Health and Human Services , said health officials are planning to deliver more rapid point of care tests , which screen asymptomatic people to study the widespread circulation of coronavirus to historically Black colleges and universities . 
Black and brown communities have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus throughout the pandemic . 
Here 's how Giroir , Trump 's testing czar , described the tests : " It 's testing it asymptomatic individuals to give an idea that we know that there is not widespread circulation , that we need to up the game and really test everyone at that point . 
We 're doing it for nursing homes and for assisted living and home health care . 
We 're going to start doing it for K 12 . 
We 'll also deliver more to tribes and HBCUs . "
