The Covid 19 pandemic has helped drill down on what needs to be in the national stockpile , Adm . Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for Health at the US Department of Health and Human Services , said during a Research ! 
America forum on Thursday . 
Speaking to the forum ’s host , CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta , Giroir said when he started March 12 , " Diagnostics were not emphasized at all . 
The National Stockpile – it ’s not a Trump administration , it 's not an Obama administration – it 's been a long standing practice that diagnostics were really not emphasized . 
I think we see the importance of them now . " 
Giroir said , " On March 12th , how many swabs did we have in the stockpile ? 
Well , there were no swabs in the stockpile . " 
When they opened up drive thru testing sites across the US , HHS realized , " We would blow through 80 % of the Strategic National Stockpile of personal protective equipment within the first month , and we could not really do that . " 
HHS needed to change the types of swabs they were using at testing sites and have " more technological breakthroughs . " 
" We need to invest over a long term period of time in diagnostics , " he said . 
" And when I talk about that , you know some things are whiz bang , and some are is just as simple as validating a nose swab instead of a nasal pharyngeal swab , " he explained . 
Giroir said in February , March and April , HHS was calling up hospital systems in New York City and asking them questions like : How many ventilators were being used ? 
How many anesthesia machines were used ? 
What ’s in the stockpile ? 
That system needs to be updated . 
" There 's just a lot of things we 're going to have to do over a period of years , that no matter how hard you try in a matter of months , you ca not redo that , " he said . 
Pandemic preparedness starts today , Giroir said .
