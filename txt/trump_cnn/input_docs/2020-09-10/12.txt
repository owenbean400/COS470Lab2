US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said on Thursday that he has no regrets about issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma for Covid 19 . 
" So , no regrets about that decision ? " 
David Rubenstein , of The Economic Club , asked Hahn during a virtual interview on Thursday . 
" None , " Hahn replied . 
Remember : A National Institutes of Health panel said earlier this month that there 's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done . 
The statement , which was posted quietly , contradicts the Trump administration 's characterization of the treatment as " historic " and a " major advance " and directly refers to last week 's emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration .
