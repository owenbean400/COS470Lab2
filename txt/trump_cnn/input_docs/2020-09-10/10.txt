President Trump 's coronavirus testing czar , Admiral Brett Giroir , told CNN 's Sanjay Gupta that while at home tests are not yet authorized or reliable enough to be read , that the public will see the administration taking " a lot of actions over the next few weeks " to spur development of these tests . 
" We 're moving science forward , " he said . 
" There will be a day where there will be at home tests that are widely available in the hundreds of millions , that are cheap , that we can test as frequently as we want â€“ we 're just not there right now , " Giroir added . 
Giroir said we need to use the tests available to us now in a " strategic manner . "
