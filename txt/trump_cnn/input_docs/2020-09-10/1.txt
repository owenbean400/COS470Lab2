Frontline worker Dr . Craig Spencer said he â€™s " furious " about revelations President Donald Trump downplayed the deadly threat from the coronavirus early in the pandemic . 
Trump told investigative reporter Bob Woodward in a series of interviews that he downplayed the danger because he wanted did not want people to panic . 
Spencer , who is the director of Global Health in ER Medicine at NY Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center said , " I think about that multiplied by 190,000 times around this country . " 
An Ebola survivor , Spencer was working in New York City when as many as 800 people a day were dying from Covid 19 in the city last spring . 
As a result , people did not know who to believe or how to get truthful information on the pandemic , on how to protect themselves or their families , Spencer said . 
" It created a situation where people were just misled , given misinformation and , quite honestly , as a public health person , a public health professional , the lies and the mysteries that are coming from the President 's mouth and the President 's Twitter feed on a near daily basis are almost impossible for public health professionals to keep up with and correct , " he said .
