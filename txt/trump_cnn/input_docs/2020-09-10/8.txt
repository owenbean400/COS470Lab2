Adm . Brett Giroir , Assistant Secretary for Health at the US Department of Health and Human Services , said , " I have never been told to slow down testing , or to reduce our efforts – and in fact , we built on testing every single month . " 
He told CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta that the US is at " an inflection point " in terms of testing . 
This month , over 100 million tests should be available , he said . 
" Between 55 % and 60 % of those – that 's 55 to 60 million – will be rapid point of care , " he added . 
" This really puts us at an inflection point that we can really protect the elderly , we could protect the vulnerable , and we can do those kinds of screening testing for schools and work that we 've been talking about for months now we have the tools to do that , " Giroir told Gupta .
