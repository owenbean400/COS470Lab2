Kristin Urquiza , whose father died from the coronavirus , says President Trump ’s remarks to journalist Bob Woodward on the virus are " simply inexcusable . " 
Trump told Woodward that he knew Covid 19 was deadly but " wanted to always play it down " to avoid creating " a panic . " 
" My father did not panic . 
Instead , he died , " Urquiza said . 
" That is what happened to tens of thousands of people across the United States , because of his decision , and because of that , I think he needs to resign . " 
Urquiza said her dad would ’ve been shocked to hear Trump ’s comments .
