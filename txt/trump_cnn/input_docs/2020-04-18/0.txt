President Trump addressed his recent tweets calling to " liberate " Virginia , Minnesota and Michigan — three political swing states that have Democratic governors . 
He said the governors who are implementing federal guidelines for stay at home orders to deal with the coronavirus are being " too tough . " 
On Virginia , he said , " What they 've done is very powerful . 
You know you could get the same result with doing a little bit less . " 
He then went off on a tangent about the Second Amendment and claimed without proof that , " They want to take their guns away . " 
Virginia has declared that gun stores are not essential businesses during the pandemic . 
" I think some things are too tough , " Trump said during Friday ’s White House press briefing . 
Asked whether these states should lift their stay at home orders , Trump said , " No , but I think elements of what they ’ve done are too much . 
It ’s just too much . " 
The President said he was not concerned about protesters spreading the coronavirus among participants attending demonstrations calling for states to reopen .
