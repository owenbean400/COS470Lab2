President Donald Trump said the government will be providing assistance to 13,000 community health sites and mobile medical stations that will give testing in medically under served regions with " many African American and Hispanic communities . " 
President Trump says that they are doing " big studies " on the racial disparities of the coronavirus , noting that " we do not like it " and it 's " not right . " 
The President said the job the community health sites do " is incredible . " 
" These centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions including many African American and Hispanic communities , " he said . 
" We 're taking care of them and it 's so important because you 've all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on African American and you 're reading a little bit less about Hispanic but likewise Hispanic communities . 
The numbers are disproportionate . "
