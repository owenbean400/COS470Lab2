President Donald Trump went into the weekend frustrated after a week of calls with industry leaders , governors and lawmakers who raised questions on whether the country was ready to be reopened , specifically whether or not there was adequate testing to reopen the economy and send people back to work , a senior administration official told CNN . 
Even allies told President Trump that to move forward there would need to be some sort of readily available mass rapid testing system in place . 
President Trump has expressed annoyance to those around him at the coverage of the White House reopening guidelines issued Thursday , this administration official said , and does not understand why the narrative is not more positive . 
A separate source in contact with the President described him as " chomping at the bit " and eager for the pandemic to be over and for businesses to reopened . 
The source added that for the first time , the President has seemed excited , believing he sees a light at the end of the tunnel . 
Adding to Trump 's frustration is that while White House medical experts have told him the country is on track for a phased reopening , those experts and Trump are not in sync on the timing of the relaxation , including whether his target date of May 1 for parts of the country can be met .
