Hundreds of protesters gathered Friday in Huntington Beach , a coastal community in California , to demand the reopening of the state 's economy , according to the event 's Facebook page . 
Many protesters ignored the state ’s social distancing guidelines as they hugged and took selfies in an effort to show their opposition to the state 's stay at home orders . 
A large number of people in the crowd waved " Trump 2020 " flags and other signage in support for the President ’s campaign .
