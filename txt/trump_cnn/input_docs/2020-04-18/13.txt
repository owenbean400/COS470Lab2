US President Donald Trump wants to open America back up in stages after the deadly coronavirus epidemic . 
The plan is not mandatory but rather a recommendation to state governors , who will be given the final responsibility for deciding when to end their widespread shelter at home orders . 
Under the plan , states which meet specific criteria — such as a drop in cases over a 14 day period — will proceed to phase 1 reopening . 
During phase one , only vulnerable individuals are recommended to shelter in place . 
Employees are recommended to return to work " in phases , " with teleworking maintained where possible . 
Gyms and some public spaces like movie theaters can reopen , while bars and schools should stay closed . 
If there is no evidence of a rebound in cases , under phase 2 reopening , non essential travel can resume and schools can reopen , while bars are allowed to operate at reduced capacity . 
Finally , if the positive trend continues , under phase 3 reopening , almost all activities return to normal — although vulnerable individuals are recommended to continue some social distancing . 
Visits to senior care facilities and hospitals can resume .
