Tim Murtaugh , the director of communications for the Trump campaign , said everyone attending the President 's rally tonight in Tulsa , Oklahoma , will have to have their temperature checked before entering the building due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The campaign will also have masks that people can wear if they want , and will be supplying hand sanitizer . 
" People are certainly aware of the situation , " Murtaugh told CNN on Saturday , adding that people have the freedom fo choice . 
When asked about the waiver attendees had to sign prior to the rally that says the Trump campaign is not liable if they get sick at the event , Murtaugh said it is just " standard language . " 
" If you buy a ticket to a baseball game , on the back of that , it 's a waiver that says watch out you may get hit by a flying ball if it leaves the field of play . 
That 's just standard , " he said . 
Tulsa 's Bank of Oklahoma Center arena holds 19,000 people . 
More people are also expected to be outside in the overflow area .
