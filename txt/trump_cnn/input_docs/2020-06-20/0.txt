Dr . Craig Spencer told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper that , from a public health standpoint , President Donald Trump ’s planned political rally for Saturday is an " absolutely horrible idea . " 
The US has 4 % of the global population and 25 % of the world 's Covid 19 deaths , he said . 
Spencer characterized the way the country has responded to the pandemic as " an abject failure . " 
People can stop the spread of the coronavirus , he said . 
Avoiding crowds , wearing a mask , good hand hygiene and testing all help . 
But a rally like this will likely fuel the pandemic .
