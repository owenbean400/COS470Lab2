President Donald Trump thanked Cambodia for allowing a cruise ship carrying 1,455 passengers , including 650 Americans , to dock after the ship was turned away from several Asian ports over coronavirus fears . 
" Thank you to the beautiful country of Cambodia for accepting the Carnival Cruise ship Westerdam into your port . 
The United States will remember your courtesy ! " 
Trump tweeted . 
Cruise ship stranded : The Westerdam , which is owned by Carnival Corporation but sails under the Holland America brand name , was supposed to be taking a 14 day cruise around east Asia . 
But the governments of Japan , Guam , the Philippines , Taiwan and Thailand refused the ship permission to dock -- despite there being no confirmed cases on the ship . 
Hun Sen said even if there were people aboard suffering from the virus , " I can respond very clearly that if there are people with this virus on the ship I would allow them to dock as soon as possible . "
