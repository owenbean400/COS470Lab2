Tulsa Mayor G.T . Bynum said in a Facebook post he did not know the " invitation had been extended " for Saturday 's campaign rally . 
Bynum said he will not attempt to block the state government or President Trump by invoking the local civil emergency authority in the city 's ordinance . 
" That authority was used earlier this year under extraordinary circumstances to prevent the catastrophic collapse of our local health care system . 
Today , that system 's capacity is strong , " he wrote . 
" We are navigating a balance between freedom and safety that is new for every city around the world , " Bynum added . 
The Trump campaign has agreed to follow Oklahoma 's guidelines for reopening , and they will utilize safety precautions at the event , according to the mayor .
