Vice President Mike Pence was pressed by Fox News hosts today on why the campaign could not host its Saturday Tulsa rally at an outdoor venue , given the spread of coronavirus through aerosols in enclosed spaces . 
He suggested that was a possibility . 
But , as CNN has reported , attendees will not be required to wear a mask . 
Trump has notably declined to wear a mask in public . 
The Tulsa Health Department said in a statement obtained Sunday by CNN that it is " concerned about the safety of any large gathering of people in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to maintain . " 
The Trump campaign has said that more than one million people have registered to attend the rally . 
The RSVPs are not tickets , and a ticket is not required for admission . 
Entry into the rally is first come , first serve . 
Pence also noted that he spoke with Oklahoma Gov . 
Kevin Stitt Monday night . 
" It really is time , Ainsley , for us to begin this campaign . 
The President wants to be out , he wants to be connecting to our supporters . 
Literally over a million people have signed up to try and obtain the opportunity to come and attend the rally , " he said . 
He continued , " The freedom of speech , the right to peacefully assemble is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution and the President and I are very confident that we â€™re going to be able to restart these rallies to tell the story of what the President has done thorough these unprecedented times but also over the last three and a half years .
