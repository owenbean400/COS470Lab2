President Donald Trump ’s plan to hold a rally in Tulsa on Saturday seems like a " terrible " idea in the time of Covid 19 , Erin Bromage , an Associate Professor of Biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth , told CNN 's Don Lemon Monday night . 
The plan " got worse , " he said , learning that the President decided to expand the size of the rally . 
In addition to an indoor stadium that holds thousands , the campaign is making additional room for his followers with a 40,000 convention hall next door . 
" I was writing about this today and 19,000 people put in a stadium , it ’s like a carnival event in some of the rallies with people yelling and screaming , people singing , " Bromage said . 
" It just seems like it ’s the complete recipe for something terrible to happen . "
