Dr . Anthony Fauci said he last spoke to President Trump two weeks ago . " Not last week , but the week before . 
I spoke with him when we made the presentation to explain to him our vaccine development efforts , " Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said while speaking to NPR ’s 1A program on Tuesday , " So it was two weeks ago , " he added . 
Remember : Even as cases rise , an administration official familiar with discussions inside the coronavirus task force told CNN the panel remains sidelined and muzzled . 
Key members — such as Fauci along with Dr . Deborah Birx and Robert Redfield — are now far less visible than they were during the early weeks of the pandemic . 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , a New York Democrat , requested a briefing next week from top administration public health officials , including Fauci and Birx , on recent coronavirus spikes in states around the country . 
" As the President continues to fixate on the stock market and Senate Republicans are ready to prematurely declare victory , we need to wrest the focus back to these crucial issues , " Schumer said last week on the Senate floor .
