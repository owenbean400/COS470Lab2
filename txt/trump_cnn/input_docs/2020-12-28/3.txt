Wall Street opened higher Monday after President Donald Trump signed into law a massive $ 2.3 trillion dollar coronavirus relief and government funding bill . 
While Trump delayed the signing of the bill for days , it still comes in time to avoid a government shutdown and expands pandemic unemployment help , which millions of Americans need to make ends meet . 
But because of the signing delay , many already enrolled in certain government programs will likely not receive a payment in this last week of the year . 
Here 's how things looked at the opening : The Dow opened up 0.6 % , or 176 points . 
The S&P 500 rose 0.7 % . 
The Nasdaq Composite opened up 0.9 % . 
Remember : This week is another shortened trading week due to the New Year â€™s holiday on Friday .
