Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on President Trump to not " just talk " but to " act " and to urge Senate Republicans to " support $ 2,000 in relief ( checks ) . " 
Speaking at a news conference in Brooklyn , New York , on Monday , he said : Schumer added that he " will be on the floor of the Senate tomorrow urging that to happen , asking for what 's called a unanimous consent request , and if Republicans go along , it will happen . 
We need that money . 
People are desperate . 
They need the help . " 
The New York Democrat noted that right now , there are " not enough " Senate Republicans for it to pass . 
On Trump signing the relief bill late Sunday , he said , " We â€™re glad the President finally signed the Covid relief bill yesterday . 
New Yorkers can breathe a momentary sigh of relief . "
