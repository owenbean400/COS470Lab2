Matthew Cox lost his job as a manager in the service industry and has been searching for full time employment since August . 
He had to relocate his family from south Florida to Indiana so his wife 's family could help with child care . 
Now , he 's working for the food delivery service Door Dash and makes about $ 300 a month . 
" It does not even pay the rent . 
So I have had to borrow money from my family , I 've had to sell some stuff , take out savings and 401 ( k ) . 
So I 'm at the point now where it 's kind of living day to day , " Cox said . 
After months of negotiations , President Trump finally approved a $ 900 billion relief package that includes $ 600 direct stimulus payments to help people like Cox â€“ but he said it 's not enough . 
" When the federal government says ' hey this is what we 're going to do and this is the numbers we 're going to get and hope everyone is happy , ' for us out there making less money or no money , it does not really do a whole lot for us , " he added . 
Tonight : The House of Representatives is set to vote on a measure to increase stimulus checks for Americans under a certain income level to $ 2,000 . 
More direct payments was something Trump argued for before signing the bill this weekend . 
House Republicans blocked an effort by Democrats to advance $ 2,000 checks last week , but the House will try again on Monday with a floor vote . 
That vote will require a two thirds majority to pass since it is taking place under a suspension of the rules , a threshold that means it would need a wide margin of bipartisan support to be approved .
