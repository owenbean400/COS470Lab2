President Donald Trump reversed course on Sunday , signing into law a massive $ 2.3 trillion coronavirus relief and government funding bill that he had objected to at the last minute . 
That signature does two important things for the US economy : It averts a government shutdown that was set to begin on Tuesday , and extends billions of dollars in coronavirus aid to struggling Americans . 
However , because Trump did not sign the bill on Saturday , those in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs will likely not receive a payment for the final week of the year . 
Their payments could also be delayed several weeks while state agencies reprogram their computers . 
Additionally , the $ 300 federal enhancement may only last 10 weeks instead of 11 weeks for most folks . 
That 's because states ca not provide benefits for weeks that start before programs are authorized , but the legislation calls for the extra payments to end on March 14 . 
Some background : The Covid 19 relief legislation was passed by Congress last Monday and was flown to Mar a Lago on Thursday to await Trump 's signature . 
But after sitting on the sidelines during the negotiations , Trump emerged with an eleventh hour complaint that a separate provision in the deal , which the President 's own White House helped broker , would only provide up to $ 600 in direct payments . 
Trump wanted to send out $ 2,000 checks . 
Trump signaled in a statement Sunday night that he signed the coronavirus relief bill only after securing a commitment for the Senate to consider legislation to increase stimulus checks from $ 600 to $ 2,000 . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , however , did not reference that commitment in his own statement Sunday night praising the President for signing the relief bill .
