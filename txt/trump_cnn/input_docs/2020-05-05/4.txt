Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the most likely origin of the coronavirus outbreak was a wildlife wet market as he called for an independent review into the origins of the pandemic . 
Two leading theories : Morrison 's comments follow recent claims from the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory , despite scientists in both China and the West saying the virus likely originated in bats . 
A senior official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) acknowledged Monday night that the US has evidence to support both leading theories of where the Covid 19 outbreak originated .
