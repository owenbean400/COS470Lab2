A top US general said there is not conclusive evidence on where the coronavirus originated in Wuhan , China , saying " we do not know " whether it began in a Chinese lab or a wet market . 
Joint Chiefs Chair Gen . Mark Milley said , " Did it come out of the virology lab in Wuhan , did it occur in the wet market there in Wuhan or did it occur somewhere else ? 
And the answer to that is we do not know and as mentioned by many people various agencies both civilian and US government are looking at that . " 
Some background : President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have repeatedly claimed there is evidence that Covid 19 originated in a Wuhan lab . 
Milley said , " the weight of evidence is that it was natural and not manmade , " and also said while there was still not " conclusive evidence " on whether or not the virus was accidentally or deliberately released in Wuhan , China , " the weight of evidence is that it was probably not intentional . " 
Intelligence shared among Five Eyes nations indicates it is " highly unlikely " that the coronavirus outbreak was spread as a result of an accident in a laboratory but rather originated in a Chinese market .
