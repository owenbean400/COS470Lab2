Dr . Stephen Hahn , the head of the Food and Drug Administration , will self quarantine for 14 days after coming in contact with an individual who tested positive for coronavirus , an FDA spokesperson told CNN . 
While the FDA did not name the person with whom Hahn came into contact , President Trump earlier Friday had revealed that Vice President Mike Pence 's press secretary , Katie Miller , had tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Hahn is a member of the White House coronavirus task force , which held its most recent meeting on Thursday . 
An official familiar with the situation inside the White House coronavirus task force told CNN it 's unclear whether some on the panel will go into quarantine and that more will be known about next steps on Saturday .
