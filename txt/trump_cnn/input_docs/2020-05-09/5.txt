Bottoms was critical of Georgia Gov . 
Brian Kemp ’s decision to reopen some businesses in the state in late April . 
" We will know in the next week or so whether or not the governor made the right decision . 
I remain concerned that we have moved too soon and really without being very thoughtful about how we should reopen our state . 
I think there are businesses that perhaps we could have slowly reopened , " she said .
