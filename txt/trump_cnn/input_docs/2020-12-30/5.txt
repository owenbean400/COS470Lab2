House Speaker Nancy Pelosi assailed Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell for slow walking the $ 2,000 CASH Act providing more relief funding for Americans in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that passed through the House earlier this week . 
" I do hope that in the days ahead – we only have a few days left in this session – that they will see the light and understand the suffering that is going on in our country , " Pelosi added . 
She did not , however , commit to bringing the CASH Act back up in a new Congress if it dies in the Senate . 
" Let ’s be hopeful it can happen this week , because the sooner it happens , the sooner the checks can go out . 
We ’re not giving up on it , the President of the United States , Donald Trump , is advocating for it , " she said . 
" It would have bipartisan support in the Senate if Mitch Mc Connell would only allow it to come to floor instead of being an obstruction to those checks going to the American people . " 
Pelosi also blasted the current administration for " holding up " the distribution the coronavirus vaccination to Americans , saying that " this has to be done better . " 
" Let ’s hope in the last few weeks of the Trump administration that they will follow the science , " she added . 
" This pandemic is horrible , " Pelosi said . 
" But it has also pulled back the curtain to reveal further disparities in our economy in our society , " she said , announcing that she is going to ask the Rules Committee in the new Congress to stand up a new committee to address economic disparity and fairness . 
Pelosi also addressed the death of Congressman elect Luke Letlow of Louisiana , who died from complications of Covid 19 , " It could happen to anyone , and it has happened to 350,000 Americans . "
