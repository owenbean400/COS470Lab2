US President elect Joe Biden said Tuesday that the Trump administration 's plan to distribute Covid 19 vaccines across the country has fallen " far behind . " 
" As I long feared and warned , the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should , " Biden said , delivering remarks on the Covid 19 crisis from Wilmington , Delaware .

The President elect had received a briefing from his Covid 19 advisory team earlier Tuesday , a transition official told CNN . 
On December 9 , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on CNN 's " New Day " that " 20 million people should get vaccinated in just the next several weeks . "
