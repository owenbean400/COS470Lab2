Americans can expect to start seeing $ 600 in their bank accounts immediately as the federal government 's second round of stimulus payments is being sent out , the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said . 
The direct deposits will continue into next week , while paper checks will be mailed out beginning Wednesday . 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said that the Treasury and the IRS are working with " unprecedented speed " to issue the second round of payments . 
The Covid 19 relief package , which President Trump signed Sunday evening , provides individuals who meet income limits with $ 600 ; couples who meet income limits with $ 1,200 ; and eligible families with an additional $ 600 per child . 
The $ 600 is half of what Americans received in the first round of stimulus payments Congress approved back in March . 
It took two weeks after that first Covid 19 relief bill was passed for the IRS to start sending out the money â€” but some eligible recipients still have not received it , months later .

Anyone who made under $ 75,000 as an individual or $ 150,000 as a couple would receive the full amount .
