Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell took a definitive stance against moving forward on a House passed bill to increase direct stimulus payments to $ 2,000 , criticizing the policy and making it clear nothing will move forward in the chamber that does not include President Trump ’s other two priorities : a full repeal of online liability protections and an investigation into voter fraud . 
Mc Connell , on Tuesday , introduced legislation that combined the three Trump priorities – each a pre requisite for Trump signing the Covid 19 relief and spending package earlier this week . 
Mc Connell , on Wednesday , made clear that the introduction of that legislation met the contours of the agreement with Trump , which stipulated only starting the process to vote on the issues . 
As it currently stands , there are no votes scheduled on Mc Connell ’s bill , or the House passed legislation , and GOP aides say it ’s likely the 116th Congress comes to an end without any action on increasing direct payments . 
The Kentucky Republican opened up his floor remarks Wednesday blasting Vermont Independent Sen . 
Bernie Sanders for holding up the NDAA override vote . 
" Today the Senate was supposed to finish legislation securing critical tools , training and support for America ’s armed forces . 
But the junior senator from Vermont had other ideas , " he said . 
Mc Connell added : " We 'll stay on this important bill until we complete it , one way or another . " 
Sanders has said he will delay the NDAA override vote unless Mc Connell brings a $ 2,000 checks to a vote on the floor . 
A final vote could stretch into Saturday if Sanders continues to hold it up . 
Eventually , though , it will pass . 
It 's just a matter of how long this takes .
