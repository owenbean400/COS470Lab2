US President Donald Trump told supporters at a rally in Florida on Friday that the coronavirus pandemic is " rounding the turn . " 
But that 's not the case , says influential Covid 19 modeler Dr . Chris Murray . 
The US has passed 8 million total cases of Covid 19 and recorded 63,000 fresh infections on Thursday -- a significant uptick from the daily numbers just a few weeks ago . More than 218,000 Americans have died from the virus . 
" We expect the death toll , unfortunately , unless we change our behavior , is going to reach 390,000 deaths by February 1 , " Murray said , citing IHME â€™s recent predictions . 
" No , it 's not over . 
The worst is still to come unfortunately . "
