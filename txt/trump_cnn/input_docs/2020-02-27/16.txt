Dr . Thomas Frieden , the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer today that he could not comment on a whistleblower in the Department of Health and Human Services who contends HHS workers handled coronavirus evacuees from Wuhan , China , without the proper protective gear until he reads the complaint . 
Instead , Frieden stressed what other top health officials have been saying for the past week , that the virus is going to spread in the US . 
He said the Trump administration ’s request for $ 2.5 billion to fight the outbreak is key . 
" What we can do now is prepare in the society , generally , in our health care settings , in the government – and one of the key things to track in this next week is what happens with the supplemental funding for this , because that will determine how robust the US response can be . " 
By the numbers : A 15th case of the coronavirus , confirmed in a woman in California on Wednesday , could potentially represent the beginning of the virus ’ spread in the community , something the CDC has been warning about for weeks .
