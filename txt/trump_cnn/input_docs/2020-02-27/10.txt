House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at her weekly presser criticized the Trump administration ’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and said that lawmakers are " close to a bipartisan agreement in the Congress " related to funding . 
She added : " That was up until now . 
Now we are trying to work in a bipartisan way , that ’s one of the reasons that I was delayed in meeting with you this morning . 
We ’re coming close to a bipartisan agreement in the Congress as to how we can go forward with a number that is a good start . 
We do not know how much we will need . 
Hopefully not so much more because prevention will work , but nonetheless we have to be ready to do what we need to do . "
