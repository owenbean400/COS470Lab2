One of the biggest takeaways from last night 's briefing was how the White House spent the day — and went on the record — denying a czar would be named to run point on the coronavirus response . 
Then Trump did just that hours later by naming Vice President Mike Pence to the role , even if they 're not calling him a " czar " to spare Health Secretary Alex Azar 's feelings . 
That 's a restructuring of the coronavirus leadership team . 
Point blank . 
Because Trump was deeply frustrated by the coverage he was getting over his administration 's response so far . 
Now Pence is put in the middle of this — and some say being set up for failure . 
Did Trump know about the new case when he came out to the briefing and said confidently Americans were at low risk and the disease likely would not spread ? 
We do not know : He did not mention it . 
But Azar certainly knew . 
From Azar 's opening statement on Cap Hill yesterday : " Coming into this hearing , I was informed that we have a 15th confirmed case , the epidemiology of which we are still discerning . " 
We can expect the White House to try to streamline who is the face of this . 
Trump was furious with the CDC doctor who said it was inevitably going to spread . 
Hence him contradicting her yesterday and saying , " I do not think it 's inevitable . " 
Yet he was contradicted in real time there at the briefing by experts who offered a much more sober analysis .
