The Trump administration is considering using a 1950 wartime law to expand the production of masks and protective gear to prevent the spread of coronavirus , according to an administration official . 
Officials are weighing whether to invoke the Defense Production Act , which would allow the administration to expand the manufacture of products deemed necessary for national security . 
Trump administration officials have said they would need a bigger stockpile of masks to prevent the spread of the virus . 
There have been internal discussions about using the law to require companies to scale up the production of medical masks and other wearable equipment . 
No decisions have been made yet , though officials have testified publicly about the shortage of available N95 masks . 
The Defense Production Act was first passed in 1950 as a response to the Korean War .
