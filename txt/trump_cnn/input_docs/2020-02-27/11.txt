House Minority Leader Kevin Mc Carthy said today that congressional Republicans and Democrats are seeking a bipartisan agreement on coronavirus funding , emphasizing that it ca not be a partisan issue . 
Asked about Speaker of the House Pelosi ’s comments that lawmakers are close to reaching a bipartisan agreement on funding , Mc Carthy would not say what kind of top line number is being looked at . 
He added : " I ’m hopeful that we can get this done next week . 
This is not something to wait around , " before going on to add : " I think you ’ll find a very bipartisan vote . 
From my point of view I want to get it done faster than waiting around and I do not think you ’re going to see an argument on either side . " 
Asked about Senate Democrats request for $ 8.5 billion , Mc Carthy said , " Just picking a number of out a hat like that never seems to work properly . 
I would like to know what the experts believe they need , make sure we fund that . " 
He also said that the supplemental funding should be a stand alone measure . 
But Mc Carthy also slammed Democrats for criticizing President Trump ’s handling of the virus , claiming that " today ’s Democrats unfortunately ca not help but put politics over the country " and " they would rather attack the President ’s response to a crisis than work together to solve it . " 
Asked if Trump ’s attacks on Democrats are also partisan , Mc Carthy answered , " I do not believe so , " because Trump was responding to what Democrats had already said .
