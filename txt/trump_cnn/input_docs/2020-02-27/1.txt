The US has ordered " a lot " of masks to deal with a potential coronavirus outbreak , President Trump said . 
" We may not need it , you understand that , " he told a reporter . 
" We 're looking at worst case scenario , we 're going to be set very quickly . " 
Trump insisted he did not think the US would end up needing the masks because flights and " borders are very controlled . "
