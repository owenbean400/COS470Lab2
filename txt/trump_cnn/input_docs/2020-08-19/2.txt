Covid 19 cases are declining across the United States and it ’s clear " trends are going in the right direction , " Adm . Dr . Brett Giroir said during a US Department of Health and Human Services telebriefing on Wednesday . 
Giroir says wearing a mask , staying a safe distance away , washing your hands along with testing " continues to yield results . " 
But Giroir does not want the news to lead to complacency because " this thing could turn around very quickly if we 're not careful . 
We saw that early on after Memorial Day , and the couple weeks afterward that sort of started the current outbreak , and it takes many weeks to get control over this once you institute measures . " 
Giroir , the assistant secretary for health at HHS , said new cases are down 22 % since their peak in July – but noted that " tragically , " deaths are the lagging indicator and still remain flat . 
More data : Giroir said of the 56 US jurisdictions , 80 % of them ( 45 out of 56 ) are currently in a declining pattern when it comes to new cases . 
Six of the 56 are flat . 
He said five are in an upward trajectory — Guam , Hawaii , California , Indiana and Vermont .
