Schools in Gwinnett County in Georgia and UNC Chapel Hill saw new coronavirus cases after resuming in person classes . 
Seeing this , the superintendent of Miami Dade County Public Schools Alberto Carvalho said his decision to reopen schools for remote learning is " vindicated . " 
" I think we cannot compromise the health and well being , the safety , the security of our kids or the ones who teach them . " 
Classes in the Miami Dade County will start online on Aug . 31 after a week of intensive training on a single platform that all teachers and students can use , Carvalho added . 
Despite the decision being at odds with the state 's mandate for in person classes and the Trump administration â€™s push to reopen schools , Carvalho says he has not felt any political pressure from the state or federal levels . 
" I never really felt intimidated over the potential loss of funding , " he said . 
" We have been informed from the very beginning by the only type of information that should guide decisions about reopening of schools in a gradual , protective way which is science , data . "
