President Donald Trump ’s staff attempted to keep roundtable participants at a distance as a precaution at the end of a briefing on Hurricane Laura in Lake Charles , Louisiana . 
After the event wrapped , Trump called some of the participants up to him so he could sign something for them . 
While some people were masked , others were not . 
John Mc Entee , director of the Presidential Personnel Office , along with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and the President 's Secret Service detail jumped in to make sure that everyone was keeping their distance from Trump . 
As the roundtable attendees approached Trump , Mc Entee got in the middle and said , " We got to just keep a little … " with his hand outstretched to keep a buffer between the attendees and the President . 
Meadows was then heard saying , " Guys , if you will , try to just keep your distance . " 
A third , unidentified voice could be heard asking someone to put their mask on . 
While Trump seemed to be fine with inviting these people up to be close to him , his staff were clearly uncomfortable with having the President too close to anyone else , whether they were wearing a mask or not . 
CNN has asked the pool traveling with the President to inquire as to whether the roundtable attendees were tested before Trump arrived .
