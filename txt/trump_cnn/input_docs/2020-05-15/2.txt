US President Trump " does not understand testing at all , " said Kathleen Sebelius , the former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services , during CNN 's town hall on the global coronavirus pandemic . 
" First , it 's absolutely incorrect we 've done more testing per capita than anyplace on Earth . 
We may have more tests , we have more people , but per capita we 're still way behind , " Sebelius said . 
So how many tests should be conducted ? 
" The goal with testing is try to identify every case that you can , " said Dr . Richard Besser , the former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Not every case will need to go to the hospital for treatment — but " every case that 's out there could be the spark that starts another outbreak in your community that gets out of control , " he said . 
The US is clearly not at that point — and is even facing gaps in testing by race and ethnicity , said Besser , pointing to the difference in impact toward black , Latino , and Native American communities .
