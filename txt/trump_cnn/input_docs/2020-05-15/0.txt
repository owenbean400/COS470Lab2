Whistleblower Dr . Rick Bright , the ousted director of the federal office charged with developing countermeasures to infectious diseases , testified before Congress earlier today . 
He slammed the Trump administration 's coronavirus response and urged lawmakers to listen to the voices of scientists to prevent " unprecedented illness and fatalities . " 
Bright 's attorney , Lisa Banks , joined CNN 's ongoing town hall to discuss his testimony . 
" He 's been preparing for a pandemic his entire career , " she said . 
" And when faced with an environment in which politics trumped science , he had to push back . 
And as he said today , he 's never been a whistleblower before . 
He 's never had to push back like that or file a complaint . 
But here he had to because American lives were at stake . " 
Here 's some context : Bright had previously led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) , an office under the Department of Health and Human Services . 
BARDA has been central to the response to the coronavirus outbreak . 
Bright was removed from the post on April 21 . 
Since then , he 's been on a short term medical leave , said Banks today . 
When discussing his future role within the National Institutes of Health , Bright learned yesterday he will no longer be working with vaccines , " so it was unclear what job they had in mind for him , " Banks said .
