The United States is on track to ship 36.7 million Binax NOW rapid point of care Covid 19 tests to states by the end of this week , the US Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to CNN on Monday . 
The Binax NOW antigen tests , developed by Abbott , are intended to help governors with reopening their states , according to the news release . 
The federal government previously announced it wants to deploy 150 million Binax NOW Covid 19 tests nationally ; 
HHS confirmed to CNN on Monday that the 36.7 million tests are part of that total . 
But Giroir added in the news release that testing does not replace following the guidelines of avoiding crowds , washing hands and wearing a mask . 
" Combining personal responsibility with smart , targeted testing is a proven formula to prevent outbreaks — but we cannot ' test our way ' out of this pandemic , " Giroir said . 
" Public vigilance in adhering to precautionary measures is required — especially as we clearly see the onset of mitigation fatigue . " 
Giroir had said on Sept . 1 that the Trump administration would begin to send the low cost antigen tests to states starting in mid September . 
On Sept . 28 , Giroir said the 6.5 million tests the government shipped to governors across the country that week were a " real step forward in our testing . " 
At that time , Giroir said that production and shipment of the tests " did not happen overnight . "
