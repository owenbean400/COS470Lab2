It 's being called the " great American surrender . " 
On Sunday , President Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows admitted that the United States was " not going to control the pandemic , " arguing in a stunning statement that " proper mitigation factors " like therapies and vaccines should be the priority , as new Covid 19 cases continue to spike . 
But there is a problem with that logic . 
Even if a potential coronavirus vaccine is approved by regulators in the coming months , Americans wo not be able to get it until well into next year . 
And letting the coronavirus rage unchecked in the interim , medical experts argue , is akin to a policy of herd immunity that would cost many thousands of lives . 
Meadows ' comments come as the White House contends with yet another coronavirus outbreak of its own . 
Vice President Mike Pence is refusing to accept CDC guidance on quarantining after his chief of staff and a ' body man ' personal assistant were among five people in his orbit to test positive . 
The White House has declared Pence an " essential worker " -- a designation normally reserved for first responders and front line medical staff -- so that he can continue campaigning . 
It 's the latest sign of the Trump team putting its own political priorities ahead of a duty of care to the American people as the country enters the final stretch before the election , Stephen Collinson writes . 
Despite a surge in cases in 35 states , the President is continuing his campaign blitz , criss crossing the US in a frantic week of packed rallies that flout social distancing and mask wearing measures . 
Meanwhile , the latest surge of Covid 19 infections has brought the US ' seven day average of new daily cases to heights not seen since the pandemic began .
