Trump adviser and son in law Jared Kushner defended Vice President Mike Pence ’s decision to continue campaigning despite his close contact with people who tested positive for coronavirus , suggesting West Wing cases have been mild and Pence is taking appropriate precautions because he has " great knowledge " about the pandemic as the leader of the task force . 
Kushner continued : " We ’re taking precautions , wearing masks , you know , social distancing and washing hands , doing what they can to prevent it . 
But people do get it … For the people in the West Wing who have gotten it so far , it ’s been fairly benign cases , you know , and obviously people are moving forward . 
And the Vice President obviously has great knowledge about the disease and the pandemic and he knows the right protocols to follow and I have every confidence that he 's following those protocols . " 
Kushner was also pressed on comments from chief of staff Mark Meadows that the US is not going to control the pandemic , but did not offer much of a defense . 
" Look , you have a global pandemic . 
It ’s impacting every place . 
People have tried different way to cope with that . 
You have that throughout Europe , you have that through the US . 
You know , you have places where they 've been locked down and it ’s spread you have places where it 's been open and it 's spread and I think that ultimately , we have to have a balanced approach but the job of the federal government has been to make sure that we get all the supplies to the people who have needed it , " he said , going on to discuss US personal protective equipment . 
He added , " Look , I think that when you saw the debate , the other side said this is a very dark winter . 
We definitely have some challenges but President Trump 's approach is we 're going to defeat the virus and we 're gonna get our country back to a stronger place than ever before . "
