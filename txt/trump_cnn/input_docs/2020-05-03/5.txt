President Donald Trump 's offer of providing 1,000 rapid coronavirus tests for Congress was declined on Saturday in a rare joint statement from Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . 
Their statement said the tests should be saved for frontline health care workers . 
Trump responded to their statement on Twitter . 
" Congress is grateful for the Administration 's generous offer to deploy rapid Covid 19 testing capabilities to Capitol Hill , but we respectfully decline the offer at this time , " Pelosi and Mc Connell said in their joint statement . 
" Our country 's testing capacities are continuing to scale up nationwide and Congress wants to keep directing resources to the frontline facilities where they can do the most good the most quickly . " 
The Senate is set to return next week with the congressional physician issuing protocols for screening and social distancing .
