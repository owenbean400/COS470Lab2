Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he is concerned about reopening the economy and relaxing social distancing measures , saying it is still very early in the outbreak . 
Massachusetts is " between the first and the fifth " inning in its fight against coronavirus , and that " we ’re still very much in the beginning days of coronavirus , " Walsh said . 
Walsh criticized the Trump administration ’s response to the outbreak , saying " the mixed messaging is confusing . " 
He responded to pictures of crowds on the national mall in Washington , DC , and New York 's Central Park , saying , " whether it 's Central Park or the Mall is the wrong message . 
We 're still very much in the beginning days of coronavirus . " 
Walsh said cities across the US still need mass testing and personal protective equipment for frontline workers . 
" As we move down the road here , if there 's a second surge , all of the equipment that they have now , they 'll need more stuff . 
I think that 's what the federal government should be focused on , " Walsh said .
