The Trump administration announced Sunday that at least 2.2 million loans , worth about $ 175 billion , have been paid out in the second round of federal emergency relief aid for small businesses . 
The second relief package was signed into law by Trump on April 24 and included an additional $ 310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) . 
The second round of PPP was distributed starting on April 27 . 
In a joint statement Sunday morning , Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza said the average size of a loan made under the second round of the program was $ 79,000 .
