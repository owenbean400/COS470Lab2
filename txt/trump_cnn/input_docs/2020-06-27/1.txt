Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell stressed that people should continue to social distance and wear masks in public until there is a vaccine for Covid 19 . 
" Until we find a vaccine , these are really important , " Mc Connell said Friday while holding up a blue mask , according to CNN affiliate WKYT . 
" This is not as complicated as a ventilator , and this is a way to indicate that you want to protect others . " 
Some context : The comments from Mc Connell , as well as other leading congressional Republicans , are in contrast to President Trump 's refusal to wear a mask in public and his urge to move on from the pandemic even as cases surge . 
Mc Connell made the comments while visiting a hospital in Morehead , Kentucky , to talk about the money provided to rural health care systems from the CARES Act , the massive coronavirus stimulus package that was enacted two months ago . 
In contrast to other nation 's dealing with the pandemic , mask wearing in the US has taken on a political dimension –– in part because of Trump .
