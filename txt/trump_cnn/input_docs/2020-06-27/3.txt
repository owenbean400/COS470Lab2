At Friday 's press briefing by the White House 's coronavirus task force -- the first in nearly two months -- Vice President Mike Pence painted a rosy picture of a country steadily getting safer and back to normal . 
It was a picture at odds with reality . 
Leaving out critical information , Pence delivered a more polished version of the upbeat , all is well dishonesty that was a hallmark of previous briefings by President Donald Trump , who did not attend the Friday session . 
Pence boasted that " we flattened the curve . " 
Fact check : The curve for the number of new confirmed cases did decline and plateau in April and May , but has headed sharply upward again in June . 
Pence claimed that " all 50 states " are " opening up safely and responsibly . " 
Fact check : About 30 states are experiencing increases in the rate of new cases , and states reopened without having met the administration 's recommended safety milestones . 
Pence claimed the country is finished with the painful part of the pandemic , saying " we 're in a much better place " than two months ago and the US is no longer " in a time of great losses and great hardship . " 
Fact check : He was right that the current number of daily deaths is substantially lower than it was at its peak -- but the pandemic is still killing more than 500 Americans a day . 
The May unemployment rate was 13.3 % . 
In other words , the loss and the hardship continue .
