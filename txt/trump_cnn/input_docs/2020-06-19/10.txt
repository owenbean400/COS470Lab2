The US is " in process of notifying the WHO that we are withdrawing , " Jim Richardson , the director of the Office of Foreign Assistance at the State Department , told reporters Friday . 
Some background : President Trump announced last month his decision to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization . 
Richardson said the State Department and United States Agency for International Development have " alternative implementers " in the countries where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly encouraged the administration to continue funding WHO operations because there were not other options . 
Those countries are Afghanistan , Egypt , Libya , Pakistan , Sudan , Syria and Turkey . 
" We still have a hard time finding implementing partners for polio , for instance , and so we 're still working through an interagency process to come to a resolution on that issue , and see how we want to proceed as the government in those unique cases , " Richardson said .
