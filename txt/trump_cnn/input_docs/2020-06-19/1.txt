New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo says he would not permit a large political rally in his state like the one planned by President Trump 's campaign in Tulsa , Oklahoma , Saturday . 
" No , no , " said Cuomo when asked by CNN 's Anderson Cooper if he 'd permit such event an event in New York , which could draw up to 19,000 people to an indoor arena without requiring masks . 
" That 's not only going to hurt the economy , it 's also going to cause more Americans to die . " 
Cuomo went on to say Trump was disregarding the science and sending the wrong signal to the nation . 
" The President ... knowing that the models now say another 30,000 people die by October , still insists that we should not be careful , that we should not follow the science : do not worry about the public health , have a political arena , " the governor said . 
" It makes no sense and it 's the exact wrong signal , he added .
