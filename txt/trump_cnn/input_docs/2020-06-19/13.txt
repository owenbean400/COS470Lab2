Intensifying anti science sentiments that have led people to ignore public health guidelines during the Covid 19 pandemic are " disturbing " and " disappointing , " Dr . Anthony Fauci said on CBS Radio Friday . 
CBS ’s Steven Portnoy had asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force specifically about his level of concern for the people who will be attending President Trump ’s rally in Tulsa on Saturday . 
Fauci thinks some members of the public harbor an anti science mentality that has intensified in the current situation and stems from a mistrust of authority . 
He sees the anti vaccination movement in this vein . 
" It ’s all part of that trend , which is very disturbing , " Fauci said . 
Fauci said he gets concerned about the increased risk of spreading infection when he sees crowds or sees people not wearing masks . 
" If in fact , for one reason or other , you feel compelled to do that , which we do not recommend , then wear a mask at all times , " Fauci said . 
Pressed again on the risk of the virus widely spreading at a mass gathering , Fauci said he could not put a number on it . 
" But it ’s very clear that the risk exists , " Fauci said .
