Dr . Peter Lurie , president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , told the House Committee on Science , Space and Technology Committee that hydroxychloroquine " turned out to be a black eye " for the US Food and Drug Administration . 
Lurie called the FDA ’s handling of hydroxychloroquine a " disappointment " and an " embarrassment . " 
Lurie , who used to work at the FDA , said drug trials are conducted by the drug manufacturer themselves . 
" Quite frankly , the process is infected with conflict of interest , and there 's not very much that can be done about it . " 
" It ’s a given that there will be that kind of conflict of interest , in that the companies will come in with an interest in depicting the data in the way that best suits them . 
That 's where the FDA comes in , " Lurie added . 
The FDA will review the data itself , Lurie said . 
" That kind of insulating of the reviewers from the manufacturer is so important . " 
Hydroxychloroquine has been used for many years to treat diseases such as malaria , rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . 
President Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid 19 .
