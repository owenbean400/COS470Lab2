Kevin Hassett , a senior adviser to President Trump , said he would " definitely " wear a mask if he were attending the President ’s campaign rally in Tulsa , Oklahoma , on Saturday . 
Hassett , who advises the President on economic issues , said he receives data about the coronavirus every day for each state in the US . 
He says that data shows an increase in Covid 19 cases in about 18 states right now , but that the increase in cases is higher than hospitalizations . 
" The spikes are not necessarily correlated where we 're seeing less social distancing and more economic activity , " Hassett claimed . 
Oklahoma ’s cases per day over the week ending June 17 is up approximately 110 % from the previous seven day period , according to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University data . 
A local official involved in planning the Tulsa rally said they expected 100,000 to show up at the campaign venue , which can hold about 20,000 people .
