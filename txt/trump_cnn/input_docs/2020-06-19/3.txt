As the number of coronavirus deaths in the US approaches 120,000 , former acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney says the " raw number of cases " is not the right metric to use . 
Information about Covid 19 changes every day , and as testing increases , there are more cases , he said . 
" I ’m not trying to minimize what the disease is ; 
I ’m trying to put it in perspective , " he said . 
In early March , President Trump announced he was replacing Mulvaney as his acting chief of staff . 
He now serves as US special envoy for Northern Ireland . 
At the CPAC conference in February , Mulvaney said Trump ’s opponents were capitalizing on growing coronavirus concerns . 
" They think this is what ’s going to be what brings down the President . 
That ’s what this is all about , " he said during the conference . 
When asked by Sciutto if he was wrong , Mulvaney said that the information that the administration was receiving from the CDC did not indicate the widespread growth of coronavirus . 
Back then , he said they were comparing the novel coronavirus to other coronaviruses — SARS and MERS — which largely did not affect the US .
