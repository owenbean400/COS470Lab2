Dr . Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , says he is worried that , unless there are policy changes , the growing numbers of new Covid 19 cases in the United States could get much bigger . 
Ten states have seen their highest daily number of cases this week . 
Nearly two dozen states have seen spikes in cases compared to last week . 
" Look , there are a few things we know that really do work , and I think unfortunately , in many parts of the country we ’re not really implementing them , and that worries me . " 
Jha said he is also worried for the people who will attend the rally President Donald Trump will hold in Tulsa on Saturday . 
Cases in Oklahoma are up 110 % from this time last week . 
Holding an event indoors , not requiring masks , and having people close together for long periods of time could spread the infection to many . 
" This is pretty much the least safe way to get people together and I ’m really worried about what ’s going to happen with this rally , " Jha said . 
" There are lots of ways of making it safer it does not sound like the campaign is really going to work on doing that . " 
Jha said it is possible that the country could see big spikes in the number of Covid 19 cases out of a rally like this , even if only a few people are infected . 
" Things could get pretty bad , pretty quickly , " Jha said .
