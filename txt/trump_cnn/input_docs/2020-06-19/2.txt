County health commissioners in Tulsa , Oklahoma , should shut down President Donald Trump ’s planned rally in the city Saturday , a leading health expert warned . 
" The risk is real , " Dr . Jonathan Reiner , a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University , told CNN ’s Erin Burnett . 
" Tulsa just had a record number of cases . 
In the last week the number of Covid 19 cases in Tulsa is up 111 % , " Reiner said , drawing a comparison to other events that might pose a danger to the public . 
The Trump campaign said masks will be available for those attending the event , but people wo not be required to wear them . 
Also , social distancing will be next to impossible in a packed arena . 
Both measures are recommended by health experts as a means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus .
