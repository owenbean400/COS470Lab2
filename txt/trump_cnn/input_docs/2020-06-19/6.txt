Despite rising coronavirus cases in Oklahoma , President Trump is forging ahead to host a rally in Tulsa tomorrow that is expected to be attended by thousands . 
Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that some people at the rally this Saturday may catch coronavirus , but added " it ’s a very small percentage . " 
Oklahoma is seeing a steady increase in its average of new confirmed cases per day . 
According to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University data , Oklahoma averaged about 203 new cases per day over the week ending June 17 , which is up approximately 110 % from the previous seven day period . 
As of Thursday morning , Tulsa County currently has the most cases — 1,825 total — of any county in the state , according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health . 
New cases in Tulsa County have also been climbing , and the county is now seeing its highest seven day average for new cases at 73.9 , according to the Tulsa Health Department . 
Dart noted Wednesday he recommended that the Trump rally be postponed " until it 's safer , until the data tells us that it 's not as large a concern , " to have people in enclosed spaces . 
The Tulsa rally is the President 's first since coronavirus shut down the country and halted all in person campaigning . 
Local and campaign officials tell CNN that more than a million people have RSVP 'd to the rally . 
A local official involved in planning said they expected 100,000 to show up at the Bank of Oklahoma Center on Saturday . 
The venue can hold just under 20,000 . 
Attendees will not be required to maintain social distance or wear masks , despite the Trump administration 's top public health officials stressing the importance of both measures in preventing the spread of coronavirus . 
Two days before the rally is set to take place , a spokesperson for the BOK Center said it had asked the Trump campaign to provide a written plan for safety measures for the event .
