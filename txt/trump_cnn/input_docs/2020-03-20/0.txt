Coronavirus tracking models in California show that the virus could infect " 56 % of our state â€™s population -- 25.5 million people , " in eight weeks , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said in a letter to President Trump . 
If those numbers hold , that could be a problem because the state may not have the capacity to hospitalize all who need it . 
" We have the capacity to surge the number of hospital beds beyond the 78,000 currently staffed beds by an additional 10,207 , " Newsom said . 
Newsom said dorm rooms at University of California and California State school systems would be converted to temporarily house coronavirus patients . 
He said the state had acquired a hospital in Northern California and will make an announcement tomorrow regarding a hospital in Southern California that will support coronavirus containment efforts .
