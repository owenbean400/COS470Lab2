The top infectious disease expert in the US , Dr . Anthony Fauci , told NBC 's " The Today Show " he thinks Americans will have to stay home and continue to social distance for several more weeks . 
Fauci also discussed the spread of the novel coronavirus with host Savannah Guthrie . 
He said the best thing the US can do right now is to delay any elective surgeries to keep hospital beds and equipment available . 
Guthrie asked if President Trump should invoke the Defense Production Act , and Fauci said the president " is very serious about doing everything we could possibly do . " 
They will meet today , Fauci said , and he is sure that would come up in their discussions . 
Guthrie asked if doctors going to the craft store to make their own medical equipment is considered the worst case scenario . 
" Obviously we are in a very difficult situation and we should be doing everything we can to mitigate that , " Fauci responded . 
Regarding the anti malaria drug Trump said could treat COVID 19 , Fauci said they have heard anecdotally that the drugs work , but they have not been tested in controlled trials . 
" So what we ’re saying is that we want to make them more available , but in the context of a protocol of some sort , that would not only make them available but that we can get some information as to whether they ’re safe and whether they really work , " Fauci said .
