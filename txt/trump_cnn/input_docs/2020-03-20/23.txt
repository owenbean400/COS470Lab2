Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and his wife sold as much as $ 1.7 million in stock last month ahead of the sharp market decline that 's resulted from the novel coronavirus global pandemic , according to Senate documents . 
Two weeks later , the North Carolina Republican sounded a blunt warning in February about the dire impact of the novel coronavirus during a private event in Washington , according to audio obtained by NPR , which contrasted with President Donald Trump 's public statements at the time that suggested the virus would disappear . 
Burr 's committee has received periodic briefings on coronavirus as the outbreak has spread , but the committee did not receive briefings on the virus the week of Burr 's stock sales , according to a source familiar with the matter . 
A week before his stock sell off , Burr authored an op ed with GOP Sen . 
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee titled , " Coronavirus prevention steps the U.S . government is taking to protect you . " 
Burr has also worked on legislation aiding US preparations for pandemics for years . 
On February 13 , Burr and his wife sold between $ 628,000 and $ 1.7 million in stock in 33 transactions , according to Senate financial disclosure records .
