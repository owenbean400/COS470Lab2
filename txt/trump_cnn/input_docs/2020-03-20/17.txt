The American Medical Association has called on the Trump administration to " leverage every tool at its disposal " to address a shortage of protective equipment and coronavirus tests . 
In a statement Friday , the doctors ’ group said that " critical shortages in test kits and personal protective equipment ( PPE ) remain unaddressed . " 
In response to the growing shortage , President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week that allows him to exercise wartime powers under the Defense Production Act , but the AMA said that " it is unclear to what degree that authority is being utilized . " 
Shortages of critical protective equipment are " posing a significant risk for our ability to treat COVID 19 patients and contain the spread of this pandemic , " the AMA said in its statement . 
The president of the group , Dr . Patrice Harris , described doctors taking drastic measures to make do : " Physicians do not have enough masks ; they are wearing a single mask all day , cleaning them at home , and sewing their own protective gear , " she said . 
On Thursday , CNN reported on guidance issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address shortages during the coronavirus pandemic . 
The agency said that health care workers could consider using masks beyond their designated shelf life , reusing them between multiple patients , and even – as a last resort – consider using scarves and bandanas as protective equipment .
