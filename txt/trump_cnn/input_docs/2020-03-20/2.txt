As the nation and the world self quarantine in the midst of a pandemic , the Supreme Court justices will meet privately on Friday , either in person or telephonically , to discuss pending cases and presumably how they will handle the rest of a blockbuster term . 
The meeting is one of the regularly scheduled conferences the justices hold throughout the term , but it comes as the court has closed its doors to the public and taken other precautions as the country grapples with the coronavirus . 
Earlier in the week , the court said that " some justices " may choose to " participate remotely by telephone . " 
That 's because six of the justices are 65 and older . 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are in their 80s â€” well within the government 's standard for individuals at a higher risk . 
In the same press release , the court said that in order to abide by " public health precautions , " the court would postpone oral arguments for the next sitting , which was scheduled to begin March 23 . 
The most important case from that sitting is President Trump 's bid to shield his financial documents . 
Some historical context : The move to postpone is exceedingly rare , but there is precedent . 
In 1918 , arguments were postponed in response to the Spanish flu epidemic . 
The calendar was shortened in 1793 and 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks .
