Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US does not have certainty about the origin of the Covid 19 pandemic , even as he insisted the virus could have begun in a Chinese lab â€“ a conclusion that other senior US officials , the US intelligence community and spy agencies in allied countries have all said that is not likely . 
However , Pompeo asserted that the lack of certainty was not a contradiction from his past comments that there was " enormous evidence " it came from a lab , claiming that they could " both be true . " 
Pompeo claimed there was " no separation " in the disparate answers from himself , top US military officials , Five Eyes officials , and the intelligence community . 
How China responded to US claim : The claim has unsurprisingly drawn fierce rebuttal from the Chinese government , which on Wednesday described the accusation as " smear " intended to bolster Trump 's reelection chances . 
Remember : Here is what we know -- and what we do not know -- about the claims and the laboratory at the center of the controversy .
