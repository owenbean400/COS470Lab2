Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said that he believes the United States has a " moral responsibility " to ensure equitable distribution of a Covid 19 vaccine around the world . 
While speaking , Fauci emphasized that he was giving his personal opinion and not speaking on behalf of the United States . 
Fauci 's comments were made a day after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at prioritizing the shipment of the coronavirus vaccine to Americans before other nations . 
" We have a moral responsibility as a rich country , along with other rich countries , to make sure that when we have the facilities and the capabilities – be it life saving drugs for HIV , life saving preventions for HIV , or a vaccine for Covid 19 – that as a global community , we do everything we can to make sure that there is the equitable distribution of those countermeasures throughout the world , " Fauci said . 
" I think we all need to pull together as a global community to make sure that there ’s equitable distribution . "
