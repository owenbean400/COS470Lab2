US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Republican Party will be " forced " to find a new state to host their convention as North Carolina Gov . 
Roy Cooper stands by his demand that party leaders provide him with plans for a scaled down event amid coronavirus concerns . 
Cooper , the President tweeted , " is still in Shelter In Place Mode , and not allowing us to occupy the arena as originally anticipated and promised . 
Would have showcased beautiful North Carolina to the World , and brought in hundreds of millions of dollars , and jobs , for the State . " 
The tweets come after the Democratic governor wrote in a letter to Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Mc Daniel and Convention CEO Marcia Lee Kelly that he would like to continue the conversation with organizers , but unless they offer up a much different plan , the chances of Charlotte , North Carolina , being able to host the August event are " very unlikely . " 
Two sources with knowledge told CNN that , despite the President 's tweet , it appears the decision is not final . 
But the sources say there have been tense conversations in the past 48 hours between the RNC and the governor 's office ahead of Trump 's self imposed deadline , which is Wednesday . 
Following Trump 's tweet , Cooper said it was " unfortunate " no deal was made . 
" We have been committed to a safe RNC convention in North Carolina and it 's unfortunate they never agreed to scale down and make changes to keep people safe . 
Protecting public health and safety during this pandemic is a priority , " Cooper said on Twitter .
