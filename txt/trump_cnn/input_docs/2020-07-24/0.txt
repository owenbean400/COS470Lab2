A convention official described chaos inside the Republican National Committee after President Trump pulled the plug on convention activities in Jacksonville , Florida . 
The official described the situation as " a multimillion dollar debacle and think of where that money could have gone , " noting the funds could have been better spent on fighting the virus . 
The official went on to say that some convention staffers simply do not know what to do now . 
The official added there were some questions whether all campaign staffers scheduled to work the event would actually show given concerns about the virus . 
This official said a key moment in the decision to scrap Jacksonville came when the local sheriff said adequate security could not be provided for the convention given the pandemic . 
That sheriff , the official said , has close ties to other local officials in the area who were all becoming more concerned by the day about hosting the convention .
