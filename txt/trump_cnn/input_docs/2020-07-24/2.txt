Despite what hordes of conspiracy theorists online may believe , Bill Gates , one of the world 's most magnanimous philanthropists , is not responsible for causing the coronavirus pandemic , he said today . 
Gates was specifically asked on CNN 's global coronavirus town hall about the fringe group known as QAnon , which claims that dozens of politicians and A list celebrities work in tandem with governments around the globe to engage in child sex abuse , among other theories . 
Followers also believe there is a " deep state " effort to annihilate President Trump . 
Earlier this week : Twitter removed thousands of accounts linked to QAnon which has become notorious for spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation online . 
" We 've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm , " Twitter 's safety team said late Tuesday in a tweet . 
" In line with this approach , this week we are taking further action on so called ' QAnon ' activity across the service . " 
More than 7,000 accounts have been removed in the last several weeks , according to Twitter . 
It also expects that additional actions it is taking to limit the reach of QAnon activity on its platform could affect 150,000 accounts worldwide . 
QAnon began as a single conspiracy theory . 
But its followers now act more like a virtual cult , largely adoring and believing whatever disinformation the conspiracy community spins up .
