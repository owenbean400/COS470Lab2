A senior administration official acknowledged that the Trump administration is feeling a major sense of urgency to distribute testing kits for the coronavirus amid bipartisan criticism that the kits are being deployed too slowly . 
The official conceded that the question from health professionals nationwide , and from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers , is : " Why ca not the feds give us tests ? " 
This official went on to note that roughly one million kits are expected to be distributed throughout the country in the coming days . 
The official emphasized that the administration is eager for the kits to be deployed in order to obtain the data needed to assess just how widespread the outbreak is becoming , something that cannot be clearly determined at the moment .
