When pressed by CNN â€™s Jeremy Diamond as to why he was taking time during the daily coronavirus task force briefing to discuss praise he has received while more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed and more than 40,000 people have died from coronavirus , Trump said he was " standing up for the men and women who have done such an incredible job , " not for himself . 
" I 'm sticking up for those people , " Trump said . 
" I am also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors and nurses . " 
When further pressed by Diamond , Trump said " those people have been excoriated by the fake news . " 
" It 's not about me . 
Nothing is about me , " he said . 
" You are never going to treat me fairly , many of you , and I understand that . " 
The clips Trump played at the briefing praised himself and not health care workers .
