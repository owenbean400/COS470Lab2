US President Donald Trump defended his playing of " self congratulatory " clips at last Sunday ’s coronavirus task force briefing . 
When pressed by CNN ’s Jeremy Diamond as to why he was taking time during the daily coronavirus task force briefing to discuss praise he has received while more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed and more than 40,000 people have died from coronavirus , Trump claimed he was " standing up for the men and women who have done such an incredible job , " not for himself . 
When further pressed by Diamond , Trump said " those people have been excoriated by the fake news . " 
Despite what he claimed , the clips Trump played and read from at the briefing were praising himself and not health care workers . 
Trump said it is not about himself . 
The US has reported more than 759,000 coronavirus cases , including at least 40,665 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
