US President Donald Trump said he is planning to use the Defense Production Act again , this time to help with the production of swabs needed to conduct coronavirus tests . 
Trump said the administration is close to finalizing a deal with a company that will convert its plant to produce 10 million swabs per month , but that he would use the DPA to force another company to do the same . 
Trump did not name either company . 
Governors on both sides of the aisle have complained that one of the reasons states cannot conduct enough coronavirus tests is that they lack the materials needed to conduct such tests , including swabs . 
Trump said last week 5 million swabs were going to be sent to the states but did not provide specifics .
