United States President Donald Trump has called the country 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's early work a " mess " -- but said things had improved . 
" CDC had obsolete tests , old tests , broken tests and a mess , " said Trump at a White House news briefing on Sunday . 
He was responding to a question about failures in testing at the CDC . 
Multiple health officials told CNN this weekend that contamination in manufacturing at the CDC caused weeks of delays that slowed the US response to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The problem stemmed in part from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols , a Food and Drug Administration spokesperson said on Saturday . 
But things have since improved , Trump said . 
Without citing evidence , however , Trump blamed prior administrations for the CDC â€™s early failures during the pandemic . 
" I told you we inherited a lot of garbage , we took , they had tests that were no good , they had all this stuff was no good , " said Trump , who has been President for three and a half years .
