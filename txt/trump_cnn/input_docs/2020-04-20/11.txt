China is not the enemy of America , Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Monday , in response to US criticism over China â€™s transparency about the virus . 
" Certain Americans should be clear about this : China is not their enemy , " Geng said at a press briefing . 
" The international community must band together to win the fight against the virus . " 
" Attacking and smearing China would not win back wasted time or lost lives , " he said . 
" We hope those people in the US respect facts , science and international consensus . 
They should stop attacking and blaming China , stop making irresponsible remarks , and focus more on domestic containment and international cooperation . " 
On Sunday , President Donald Trump said the US wanted to send investigators into China , but that previous requests to do so had been rebuffed . 
Geng also called on the international community to " band together to cooperate , instead of pointing fingers at each other or even demanding compensation , " referring to reports that Republican lawmakers in the US had introduced legislation last week allowing Americans to sue the government of China over misinformation about the virus . 
In addition , Geng said Australia 's call for an " independent review " of how the virus began in China was " disrespectful . " 
He urged Australia to do more to improve bilateral ties , especially bilateral cooperation on fighting the pandemic , instead of " echoing a certain country and following its footsteps to hype up the issue . "
