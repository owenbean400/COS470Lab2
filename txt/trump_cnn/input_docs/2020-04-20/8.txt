US President Donald Trump on Sunday called people who are protesting their governors ’ social distancing measures " great people . " 
Trump said this despite the fact the states are following recommendations of federal health officials to institute the distancing guidelines . 
In recent days Trump has encouraged governors to relax those guidelines as soon as they feel it ’s safe to do so . 
Trump was asked on Sunday if he is worried that his tweets about liberating Kentucky , Michigan and Virginia are in any way helping to incite potential violence , as some governors have reportedly received death threats . 
" Their life was taken away from them , " he said . 
" These people love our country , they want to get back to work . "
