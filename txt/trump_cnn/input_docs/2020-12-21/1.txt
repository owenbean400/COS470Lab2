US Leaders in the House and Senate reached an agreement late Sunday on a$900 billion pandemic relief bill that includes enhanced unemployment benefits and direct cash payments . 
There were several changes made from a proposal put forward nearly two weeks ago by a bipartisan group of lawmakers . 
Direct stimulus checks were brought in at the last minute . 
Direct aid to states and liability protections for companies were left out . 
If the new bill passes , it will be the second largest federal stimulus package after the $ 2 trillion CARES Act that Congress approved in March . 
Lawmakers in both chambers are expected to vote Monday and send the bill to President Donald Trump 's desk for his signature -- just in time to get something done before the end of December , when several aid programs in the CARES Act are set to expire , including key pandemic jobless assistance measures and eviction protections . 
The full bill text had not been released as of Sunday night . 
Here 's some of what we know so far from summaries released by Democratic and Republican leadership : Stimulus checks : The package would send direct stimulus payments of $ 600 to individuals , half the amount provided in the first round of checks that went out in the spring Unemployment benefits : The jobless would receive a $ 300 weekly federal enhancement in benefits for 11 weeks , from the end of December through mid March under the deal . 
The amount is half of the earlier federal boost , which ran out at the end of July . 
Small business loans : The bill would reopen the Paycheck Protection Program so that some of the hardest hit small businesses can apply for a second loan . 
The program stopped taking applications for the first round of loans in August .
