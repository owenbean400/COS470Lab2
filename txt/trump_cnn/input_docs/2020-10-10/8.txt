Florida will be " like a house on fire " in a matter of weeks because the state has dropped coronavirus precautions , and President Donald Trump probably should not hold a rally there right now , infectious disease specialist Mike Osterholm said Friday . 
Trump , who has been battling Covid 19 for the past week , is heading to Florida Monday for a campaign rally . 
Osterholm said it ’s probably not a good idea to hold a rally in the state right now , even if it ’s held outside . 
The state has reported 2,900 new infections in the past day , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
" The challenge we have is helping the American people understand if you bring people together , even when they 're outdoors , it 's less risk of transmission being close together outdoors , but it 's surely not zero , " he said . 
Trump is also planning an outdoor gathering at the White House Saturday and said he ’ll address the crowd from a balcony . 
Osterholm said attending that event is not a good idea either . 
" I would not go right now because I think the White House itself has a fair number of infections , " he said . 
Trump was released from hospital Monday and other administration staffers are still battling the virus .
