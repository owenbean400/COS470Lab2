The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) is an " indispensable partner " in the fight against coronavirus and Germany supports its mandate , the country ’s Chancellor Angela Merkel says . 
Her comments put her at odds with US President Donald Trump , who has suspended funding for the international body and accused it of " severely mismanaging " the pandemic . 
In an address to the German parliament , Merkel said international cooperation was " extremely important " to defeat the outbreak . 
At a European level , Merkel says she will work with other leaders to ensure there is a rapid response to the changing situation , adding that Germany ought to be prepared to pay more into the EU budget . 
" Our consultations today wo not yet be about nailing down details or deciding on the extent but one thing is already clear : in the spirit of solidarity , we should be prepared -- over a limited period of time -- to make … much higher contributions to the EU budget , " she said .
