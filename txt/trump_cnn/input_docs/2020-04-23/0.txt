US President Donald Trump said he signed his immigration executive order before the coronavirus press briefing on Wednesday . 
The order is expected to temporarily halt the issuance of new green cards and work visas -- steps that had already effectively been in place amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
" We have to take care of our patients , we have to take care of our great American workers and that 's what we 're doing , " he added . 
" So I just signed it just before coming into the room , and very important . "
