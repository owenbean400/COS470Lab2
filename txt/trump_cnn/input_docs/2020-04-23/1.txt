Kathleen Sebelius , who served as US secretary of health and human services under former president Barack Obama , says she is " alarmed " at the political spin she sees at scientific briefings from the current White House . 
Speaking to Anderson Cooper on CNN â€™s AC360 Wednesday , Sebelius said that during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic , the Obama White House took a much different approach than one the Trump administration is taking with the coronavirus pandemic . 
Sebelius said she thinks the second wave of the coronavirus in the fall will be much more deadly , particularly if there is a " robust " flu season . 
If coronavirus patients will need to be cared for in addition to flu patients , " it could be deadly for even more individuals in this country , " Sebelius said . 
Sebelius encouraged people to get a flu shot as soon as one becomes available .
