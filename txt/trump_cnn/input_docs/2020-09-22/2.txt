It is not just the elderly who are at risk of serious illness when infected with the novel coronavirus . 
Younger people with underlying conditions are also in that high risk category , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta during the CITIZEN by CNN event on Tuesday . 
" It is not just the elderly and those with underlying conditions , " Fauci said . 
" Because it can be serious in young people . " 
Quantitatively , " for sure , " it ’s much less serious as a group in young people , he said , but it is important to remember that there are many people in all age groups who have underlying conditions . 
If you ’re a younger person with an underlying condition such as diabetes , obesity , hypertension or heart disease , " You are in the risk category for a serious disease , " he said . 
The people with underlying conditions make up a substantial proportion of the population , Fauci said . 
" So , do not just think the elderly are the problem , " he said . 
" True , people with underlying conditions , but those are not just isolated to the elderly . 
There are plenty of younger people who have underlying conditions that put them at risk . " 
Fauci 's comments come a day after President Trump falsely claimed the virus affects " nobody young . " 
" We now know the disease ; we did not know it . 
Now we know it — it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems . 
If they have other problems , that 's what it really affects . 
In some states , it affects thousands of people , nobody young . 
Below the age of 18 , like , nobody , " Trump said at a rally in Swanton , Ohio , last night .
