Dr . Anthony Fauci said he would not grade how the United States has handled the Covid 19 pandemic â€“ but instead said the numbers speak for themselves . 
During a CITIZEN by CNN Conference on Tuesday , Dr . Sanjay Gupta read a viewer question about President Trump giving the White House response to the pandemic an A + . 
Fauci refused to give his own grade , saying he does not find those types of questions helpful . 
" Take a look at the numbers and make up your own mind , " Fauci said . 
" We do not need a soundbite from me . 
Take a look at the numbers . " 
Some context : " We 're rounding the corner , " Trump told " Fox & Friends " of the coronavirus during an interview Monday morning . 
" With or without a vaccine . 
They hate when I say that but that 's the way it is . ... 
We 've done a phenomenal job . 
Not just a good job , a phenomenal job . 
Other than public relations , but that 's because I have fake news . 
On public relations , I give myself a D . 
On the job itself , we take an A + . " 
The President 's comments come as the country nears 200,000 coronavirus deaths .
