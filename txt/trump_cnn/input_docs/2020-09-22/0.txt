As the US approaches the grim milestone of 200,000 death from coronavirus , President Trump last night falsely claimed the virus affects " nobody young . " 
" We now know the disease ; we did not know it . 
Now we know it -- it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems . 
If they have other problems , that 's what it really affects . 
In some states , it affects thousands of people , nobody young . 
Below the age of 18 , like , nobody , " Trump said at a rally in Swanton , Ohio . 
Previously , Trump claimed children children are " almost immune from this disease . " 
Facts First : While children are , on the whole , less likely to get seriously ill or die from the coronavirus than adults are , they are certainly not " immune ; " children get infected , transmit the virus , and do sometimes get seriously ill or die .
