US Vice President Mike Pence has encouraged young Americans to get a coronavirus test if they have concerns . 
During his briefing with Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott on Sunday , Pence discussed how they can " accelerate results of testing . " 
He said he would take the feedback to the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the administration â€™s private partners . 
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed the need for increased testing . 
At his Tulsa , Oklahoma , rally last week Trump suggested that he had asked for testing to be slowed down . 
Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator , told reporters that Texas health officials are seeing an increase in hospitalization rates among 20 - to 40 year olds , which she said indicated there is a large percentage in this age group who are positive but were asymptomatic . 
Pence also encouraged Americans to wear masks , but again deferred to local ordinances for mask requirements . 
Later in the briefing , Birx said , " I 'm really appealing to every Texan to wear a mask . " 
Pence and Birx both stressed that younger Americans need to take steps to protect older Americans . 
Pence wore a mask earlier Sunday while visiting a church but has not always worn masks in public events .
