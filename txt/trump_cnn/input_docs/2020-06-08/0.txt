In a new op ed published in The New York Times on Monday , University of Pennsylvania professors Dr . Ezekiel Emanuel and Dr . Paul Offit pose the concern that President Trump could push for the release of a Covid 19 vaccine prematurely in order to boost his campaign for the upcoming presidential election in November . 
They went on to describe how there are 123 candidate Covid 19 vaccines in development around the world and 10 are currently in human trials . 
In the United States , the federal government 's " Operation Warp Speed " vaccine program aims to have a vaccine ready by the end of the year . 
As the race for a vaccine continues , " the F.D.A . must require more than the production of antibodies to approve a vaccine , even for an emergency authorization , much less licensing . 
Only when the independent data safety and monitoring board composed of physicians , researchers and biostatisticians reviews the accumulated trial data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines , should the F.D.A . be allowed to decide on approval , " Emanuel and Offit wrote . 
" Thousands of Americans have already died as Donald Trump has perpetually postponed effective public health interventions and made poor therapeutic recommendations , " Emanuel and Offit wrote . 
" We must be on alert to prevent him from corrupting the rigorous assessment of safety and effectiveness of Covid 19 vaccines in order to pull an October vaccine surprise to try to win re election , " they continued .
