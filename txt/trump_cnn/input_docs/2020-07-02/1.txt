U.S . Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday that the Trump administration is considering whether to give money to schools to better equip them to be ready for classes to begin in the fall . 
Mnuchin said the administration would " absolutely " support the legislation if it included funding for schools . 
" We want to make sure that kids are safe and that if there is money that schools need to spend to safely have people in classrooms , social distance , spread things out , change hours — these are all the things we ’re looking at , " he added .
