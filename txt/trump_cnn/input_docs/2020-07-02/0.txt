President Trump spoke from the White House briefing room this morning to tout a better than expected jobs report . 
The appearance came a day after the US set a record number of new coronavirus cases in a single day , with more than 50,000 cases reported . 
It took a little more than two months for the US to record its first 50,000 coronavirus cases . 
The President said June â€™s job numbers , with almost 5 million jobs added , shattered all expectations . 
" This is the largest monthly job gain in the history of our country , " he said . 
Remember : The numbers today wo not necessarily show any cracks in the recovery that may have emerged in recent days as the Covid 19 outlook deteriorates . 
President Trump did not take questions after his comments .
