The federal agency responsible for granting citizenship , providing immigration benefits , and processing visa applications is bracing to furlough thousands of employees in August — a move that could grind the US immigration system to a halt . 
US Citizenship and Immigration Services , a fee funded agency , says it ’s at a loss for money after having to close offices and put services on pause during the pandemic . 
Over recent weeks , the agency has been preparing to furlough more than half of its workforce unless Congress provides additional funding . 
Notices went out to staff this week that can potentially be furloughed , according to an agency spokesperson . 
USCIS has been at the center of some of the Trump administration ’s most significant immigration policies , including a litany of regulations intended to curb asylum in the United States . 
The possible furlough of 13,400 of the agency ’s nearly 20,000 employees risks disrupting USCIS operations . 
Michael Knowles , president of the American Federation of Government Employees local union that represents Washington , DC area employees , similarly expressed concerns over what the furloughs might mean for the agency and those who depend on its services . 
" It���s not in our national interest to let the immigration service fail . 
You need a functioning immigration service , " Knowles said . 
" The damage would be long lasting . " 
How Congress is reacting : While USCIS is sounding the alarm over lack of funding , the agency has not submitted a formal funding request to Congress . 
" The Trump White House is responsible for requesting supplemental funding , but all they have sent Congress is a one page letter that provides virtually no information on the shortfall or proposed remedies , " said Evan Hollander , communications director for the House Appropriations Committee . 
" Despite this egregious lack of communication , House Democrats are closely tracking USCIS ’ financial difficulties and are prepared to discuss solutions as part of negotiations on the next phase of coronavirus response legislation , " he added . 
A congressional aide told CNN that Democratic staff sent USCIS a proposal two weeks ago that lays out a plan to pay back the funds that might be appropriated , but have not heard back from the agency . 
Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont , sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget in late June , urging action from the administration . 
Leahy said he spoke with USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow who informally requested $ 1.2 billion in emergency funding to get USCIS through the end of the calendar year . 
But no formal request has come through .
