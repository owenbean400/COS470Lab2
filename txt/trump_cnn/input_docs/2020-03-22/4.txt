Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said there is a problem with people trying to separate himself and President Trump when it comes to their approaches to the coronavirus crisis , but that " there is not , fundamentally , a difference there . " 
Fauci , in an interview on CBS " Face the Nation , " was asked about the President â€™s tweet on Saturday in which he stated that a mixture of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin could help people suffering from Covid 19 . 
" HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN , taken together , have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine ..." Trump tweeted on Saturday . 
When asked on Sunday where the President got that information , Fauci said Trump had heard about this combination of drugs from anecdotal reports .
