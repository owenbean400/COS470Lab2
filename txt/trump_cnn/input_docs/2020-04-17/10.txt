The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Friday called on the Trump administration to end its practice of swiftly removing migrant children arrested on the southern border , according to a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Last month , the administration invoked public health law to begin suspending entry of all migrants " seeking to enter the US without proper travel documentation " for both the northern and southern border , citing the coronavirus pandemic . 
As of April 9 , around 300 children who arrived alone to the border have been expelled â€” a break from longstanding practice of referring unaccompanied children to the care of the US Health and Human Services Department . 
The Trump administration has been trying to deport unaccompanied children from non contiguous countries shortly after arrest , arguing that the system as is encourages illegal immigration and the exploitation of children . 
Those attempts , though , have been unsuccessful . 
The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act dictates how migrant children who arrive alone are to be handled . 
US Customs and Border Protection previously told CNN there may be exceptions , like if an agent suspects trafficking or sees signs of illness . 
Still , very few children have been turned over to the care of HHS , with referrals largely hovering in the single digits daily . 
The caucus requested information on the number of children removed , details on processing , and what steps DHS has taken to ensure the safety of children , among other things , by April 20 .
