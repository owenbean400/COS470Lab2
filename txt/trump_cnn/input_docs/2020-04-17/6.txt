Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on MSNBC that he has had " good conversations " with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about how to extend a small business lending program that has run out of money , while also expanding coronavirus testing and providing more assistance for hospitals and local governments . 
Schumer said the talks will continue through the weekend . 
Schumer said that Democrats have proposed $ 100 billion for hospitals , $ 30 billion for a testing program and assistance for local governments in addition to more funding for the Small Business Administration ’s Paycheck Protection Program . 
" It 's vital we do this , " said Schumer . 
" It ’s vital we help small business , but if we do not deal with the testing and health care problems , if we do not deal with the local government problems , small business may have enough money to get back , although we got to fix that program , but people wo not go out on the streets . " 
Schumer also said the Paycheck Protection Program needs to be reformed as the federal government gives it more money , saying that many small businesses are having trouble getting approved for loans . 
Schumer also said that the plan to reopen the country President Trump outlined on Thursday is " a little more measured than what the President has said in the past , " but the New York Democrat also voiced concerns over the lack of testing .
