Washington state Gov . 
Jay Inslee called President Trump " unhinged " following a series of tweets saying states should be liberated . 
On Friday , Trump tweeted about liberating Minnesota , Michigan and Virginia , all of which have Democratic governors who have been the subject of protests over coronavirus restrictions . 
" The President ’s statements this morning encourage illegal and dangerous acts . 
He is putting millions of people in danger of contracting COVID 19 , " Inslee said in a statement . 
" His unhinged rantings and calls for people to ‘ liberate ’ states could also lead to violence . 
We ’ve seen it before , " the governor added . 
Although Washington was not one of the states mentioned in the President ’s tweets , Inslee said the tweets could have implications across the country . 
" The President ’s call to action today threatens to undermine his own goal of recovery by further delaying the ability of states to amend current interventions in a safe , evidence based way , " Inslee said . 
The tweets came less than 24 hours after his administration issued a report calling for a deliberate , phased in approach to restarting the economy .
