Former acting Labor Secretary Seth Harris expressed criticism of President Trump ’s plan to reopen the economy , saying " if you ca not do that safely , then our workplaces are going to turn into killing fields . " 
Harris , who worked for the Obama administration , says Trump ’s federal guidelines are " seriously lacking " for workplaces , citing no plans for contact tracing , PPE for employees , and specific protections for workers . 
" If I were an employer who read the President 's plan , I would feel like the federal government was hanging me out to dry and providing me with no support , " he said . 
Harris said the federal government needs to be more involved and issue specific guidelines for employers to protect workers and get people back to their jobs safely .
