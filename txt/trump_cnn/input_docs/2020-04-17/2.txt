US President Donald Trump seemed to suggest during today 's press briefing that world leaders were not adequately warned about the severity of the coronavirus , saying he was " angry " because he and fellow G7 leaders were out of the loop . 
Speaking about a meeting earlier Thursday with other G7 leaders , Trump said , " all of them and their countries have been devastated by this . 
Their economies have been devastated by this . " 
Without mentioning China by name , where the first cases of the coronavirus were reported , Trump added , " I ’m not saying anything . 
I ’m saying people should have told us about this . 
They should have told the rest of the world , too . "
