Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told STAT News that vaccine development is not a common topic of conversation with President Trump . 
Fauci said when the White House Task Force was meeting every day , he ’d also have meetings with Trump about four times a week . 
" But as you probably noticed , that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately . 
And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased , " Fauci told the medical news website . 
Fauci was not impressed with how Moderna put out a press release on their vaccine data . 
" I did not like that , " he said . 
" What we would have preferred to do , quite frankly , is to wait until we had the data from the entire Phase 1 — which I hear is quite similar to the data that they showed — and publish it in a reputable journal and show all the data . " 
Nevertheless , the Moderna release did make him " cautiously optimistic . " 
He ’s also happy to see several other vaccines in development , including the Oxford University/Astra Zeneca vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine , as well . 
As Fauci has said before , the timetable for having a vaccine by the end of the year is " aspirational " but " doable . " 
" The only thing that ’s the big unknown to me is that , is it going to be effective ? 
I think we could do it within the time frame that I ’ve outlined . 
But there ’s no guarantee that it ’s going to be effective , " he said . 
" Whether we do the trial over 10 years , or we do it over four months , the endpoint is still the same . " 
But that does not mean he ’s worry free . 
When asked if the prospect of an adverse reaction to the vaccine worries him , Fauci simply said , " Yes , I am . "
