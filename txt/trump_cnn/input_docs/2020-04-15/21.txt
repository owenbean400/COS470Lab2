Washington Gov . 
Jay Inslee said rapid testing will be key to determining when emergency restrictions can be lifted . 
Inslee said he will make that decision on his own timetable without waiting for authorization from President Trump . 
" We actually have authorization , " Inslee said . 
" That comes from our Constitution and the US Constitution . " 
He said he was not sure , unlike Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti , whether he would say there wo not be a public event this year in Washington . 
" I wish I had a crystal ball to say when , why , what game , what day , what sport , " he said . 
" I ca not do that . "
