Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Wednesday that " there is going to be a great deal of variability " when thinking about relaxing social distancing guidelines . 
Fauci was asked about President Trump 's remarks about the possibility that some states could lift stay at home orders before May 1 . 
Fauci added that some states will do " nothing different because they are still in a really difficult situation , and you would not want to relax any of the physical separation guidelines , and others that would be doing really much better . 
So It 's not going to be a one size fits all . "
