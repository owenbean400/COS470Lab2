President Trump said Wednesday that new guidelines regarding preventing the spread of coronavirus while reopening the economy will be announced at a news conference Thursday . 
Trump announced that data " suggests that nationwide , we are past the peak on new cases , " citing flattening of the curve in Detroit and Denver , new cases declining in New York , and " great progress " in Washington , DC , Baltimore , Philadelphia , and St . Louis . 
As CNN has reported , the new recommendations would mimic the social distancing guidelines the President announced in March and extended at the start of April , while not mandatory , they carry the weight of the federal government and the presidency . 
The comments come the same day Trump was told by many business stakeholders that more testing was needed in order for Americans to return to work .
