Dr . Anthony Fauci , the country 's top medical expert on the coronavirus pandemic and a member of President Trump 's coronavirus task force , said there is a way for sports to return . 
He suggested no fans and weekly testing . 
Appearing on Snapchat 's Peter Hamby show , " Good Luck America , " Fauci said , " There 's a way of doing that . 
Nobody comes to the stadium . 
Put [ the players ] in big hotels , wherever you want to play , keep them very well surveilled ... and have them tested every single week and make sure they do not wind up infecting each other or their family , and just let them play the season out . " 
" People say you ca not play without spectators . 
Well , I think you will probably get enough buy in if from people who are dying to see a baseball game , particularly me . 
I 'm living in Washington . 
We have the world champion Washington Nationals and I want to see them play again , " he added .
