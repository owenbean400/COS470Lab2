In the first phone call convened between President Trump and some members of his newly formed business council , industry leaders reiterated to the President what public health experts and governors have been telling him for weeks : that there would need to be guarantees of ramped up coronavirus testing before people would return to work , according to one person briefed on the discussions . 
The call , one of a series being held with various sectors on Wednesday , was the first task force teleconference aimed at devising a strategy for reopening the country . 
The call lasted for about an hour and had dozens of participants from the banking , food , hospitality and retail sectors , many of whom lauded the President and his administration for their efforts to combat coronavirus and jumpstart the economy , this person said . 
Many of Trump ’s conservative allies have encouraged him to listen to advice from business leaders , hopeful their recommendations on reopening parts of the country will counterbalance the advice of public health experts like Drs . 
Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx , who convinced Trump to extend social distancing guidelines by another month at the start of April . 
Those allies are convinced internal discussions on the coronavirus task force , and the information it provides the President , are overly weighted toward models and worst case public health scenarios . 
They had hoped another panel inside the White House focused on the economic effects of the pandemic might lend equilibrium . 
Some of Trump ’s advisers also hoped having the imprimatur of American industry on White House decision making might lend credibility — and cover — to whatever decision Trump announces on how and when to recommend reopening certain portions of the country , which some fear could lead to new outbreaks if rushed out too quickly . 
But uncertainty about the new task force prevailed from nearly the moment Trump said he was considering in on April 5 .
