President Trump was pressed Wednesday by CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins on reports that business leaders told him on a call today that testing needs to ramp up before Americans go back to work , echoing his health officials . 
Trump said he also wanted widespread testing , but passed the buck to the nation ’s governors , many of whom have been looking to the federal government for testing support . 
" It ’s what I want , too . 
We have great tests and we want the states to administer these tests for the most part , but we ’re standing behind them . 
We have great tests , we ’ve done more testing now than any country in the world , " he said naming two health care companies . 
He continued : " We will be working very much with the governors of the states . 
We want them to do it . 
We ’re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas , we ’re not going to be running a parking lot where you have a Walmart … but you have a testing center and running that from Washington , DC . 
The states are much better equipped to do it . 
But we ’ll be working with the states . 
We ’re standing behind the states . 
We ’re going to work very closely with the governors in terms of that , getting additional equipment . " 
Trump also warned that the federal government can take " strong action , including a closedown " if he is unhappy with a governor ’s actions . 
Asked when drive through tests will be more widespread and available to Americans – not just those health care workers and others on the frontlines , Trump said it would be determined by a combination of states , companies , and the federal government . 
" I think the companies will determine that , and the governors will determine that , and the federal government will do and if we ’re not happy we ’ll take very strong action against a state or a governor . "
