US negotiators entered a crucial day in the effort to deploy more than $ 1 trillion in emergency stimulus to a staggering economy , with a growing consensus on a final agreement , but a handful of significant hang ups still need to be resolved . 
Bipartisan groups of senators worked late into Friday night with top officials from President Trump 's administration to lock in a final agreement — an agreement that people directly involved in the negotiations tell CNN could top a cost of $ 1.5 trillion — before falling short of a midnight deadline imposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell . 
Larry Kudlow , a top economic adviser to Trump , went even further on the overall scope the package Saturday , telling reporters it could top $ 2 trillion . 
" The package is coming in about 10 % of GDP , it 's a very large package , " Kudlow , the director of the National Economic Council , said . 
Ten percent of gross domestic product is roughly $ 2 trillion . 
The expanding price tag of the package was matched only the expanding crisis it is being drafted to try and blunt . 
The negotiations are expected to continue toward a final agreement through the day , with both sides acknowledging failure at this point is not an option .
