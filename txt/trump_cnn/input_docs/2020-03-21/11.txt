Despite federal guidelines , President Trump Saturday suggested health care workers sanitize and reuse masks when treating coronavirus patients , rather than " throwing away " masks that are in short supply . 
Suggesting that health care workers instead clean and reuse the masks , the President said : It is unclear which type of mask the President was describing , but FDA guidelines for the common N95 respirator masks state they " should not be shared or reused . " 
Neither the FDA nor CDC guidelines suggest the possibility of sanitizing masks for safe reuse .
