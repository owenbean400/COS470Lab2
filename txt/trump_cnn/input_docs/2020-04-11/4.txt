A constitutional lawyer says President Trump might not have the authority to completely reopen the country from restrictions put in place to help combat the coronavirus pandemic . 
Page Pate , a criminal defense and constitutional attorney , told CNN that the Constitution and US Supreme Court interpretation does not give the President the authority to override governors ' decisions . 
Some context : This insight comes after President Trump said Friday at the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing that the decision to reopen the country 's economy will be the " biggest decision " he 's ever made . 
Pate said although this is how the Constitution is interpreted , this particular issue has not played out in the courts before . 
" If you look at the constitution , the president 's responsibilities and authority ends with the federal government . 
He cannot control the individual states as far as specific local restrictions , " he said .
