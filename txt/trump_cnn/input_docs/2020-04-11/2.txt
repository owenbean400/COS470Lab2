If the US ends social distancing and other coronavirus mitigation strategies by May 1 , as President Donald Trump has encouraged , case numbers in the country could rebound , officials warned . 
The projections are based on new modeling scenarios run by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) at the University of Washington that assume social distancing policies will end from next month . 
" The risk of rebound is very great , " IHME Director Dr . Chris Murray told CNN late Friday . 
The projections are based on new modeling scenarios run by IHME that assume social distancing policies will end from next month . 
The research center plans to release state level analyses based on the new models next week , Murray said . 
The warning comes after Trump said he wanted to reopen the country 's economy , despite many researchers and medical staff saying it 's far too early for such a move . 
" I would love to open ( the economy ) . 
I have not determined anything , the facts are going to determine what I do . 
But we do want to get the country opened , so important , " Trump said at a briefing on Friday .
