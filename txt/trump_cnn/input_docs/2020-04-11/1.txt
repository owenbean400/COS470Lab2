The mayor of Los Angeles urged the US to continue social distancing and ramp up coronavirus testing , warning that President Donald Trump 's plan to reopen the country could place lives at risk . 
" The best way to help the economy is to make sure that we have the public health side taken care of , and the best way to save lives is to make sure that we do not open the economy early , " Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a press conference Friday . 
This came shortly after Trump announced he was convening a second coronavirus task force -- called the ' Opening our Country Council ' . 
According to previous CNN reporting , modeling suggests several red states will not hit their worst points until nearly the end of April -- which means it 'll be nearly impossible to reopen the economy in those areas by early May , as Trump has pushed to do . 
Garcetti urged national leadership to follow the guidance of medical professionals and prepare for the possibility of extended stay at home orders . 
" This is something that will require national leadership ... it 's not something that we can wall off , " he added .
