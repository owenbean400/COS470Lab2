The US House of Representatives voted on Thursday to approve a roughly $ 480 billion package to deliver aid to small businesses and hospitals and expand Covid 19 testing -- the latest attempt by lawmakers to blunt the devastating impact of the pandemic . 
The vote was 388-5 and passed with overwhelming bipartisan support . 
The measure passed the Senate earlier this week and will now go to US President Donald Trump , who has expressed support for the legislation and indicated that he will sign it . 
Where the money is expected to go : $ 310 billion will go to the Paycheck Protection Program , which was set up to help small businesses struggling from the economic deep freeze triggered by coronavirus . 
Funding for the program ran dry earlier this month , prompting an outcry from the business community . 
Some $ 75 billion will go to hospitals and health care providers to address coronavirus expenses and lost revenue , and $ 25 billion to facilitate and expand Covid 19 testing . 
The increased funding for testing comes at a time when there is widespread recognition that testing capacity must increase and improve as states consider when to reopen businesses and lift lockdowns . 
Referred to as an " interim " measure by lawmakers , the legislation is the latest historic effort by Washington to prop up the economy on the heels of a more than $ 2 trillion rescue package along with other relief measures already approved by Congress .
