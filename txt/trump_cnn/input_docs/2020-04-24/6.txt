On Thursday , US President Donald Trump suggested that scientists may want to explore bringing UV light inside the body to kill a Covid 19 infection , or should consider the use of disinfectant that " knocks it out in a minute ... by injection inside or almost a cleaning . " 
Speaking on CNN 's global coronavirus town hall , Hahn added that it 's a " natural question " given that there is some preliminary data showing that light therapy can have an impact on the coronavirus . 
Dr . Leana Wen , the former Baltimore health commissioner , agreed that nobody should be ingesting bleach or other disinfectants . 
" I do not think there 's any need to hedge on that , " she said .
