There was no consensus reached during President Trump 's lunch with Senate Republicans on ways to boost the economy and blunt the impact from the spreading coronavirus , multiple sources tell CNN . 
Trump made the rare trip to Capitol Hill Tuesday after promising " major " and " dramatic " economic steps . 
But while sources familiar with the lunch said a multitude of options were discussed , members emerged without a concrete plan in hand . 
One option the President has pushed that some Republican senators have been skeptical of is a payroll tax cut , which would put extra cash into people 's pockets in hopes of boosting the economy . 
Several have questioned how effective it would be during the outbreak , when more people are being encouraged to stay home . 
According to several sources familiar with the lunch , Trump floated the idea of a permanent payroll tax cut , but also weighed having a temporary cut that lasted for several months . 
While some assumed it would be limited , Trump suggested he would not want the tax cut to expire before the November election , noting at one point that he would get credit from voters if it passed , according to one person familiar . 
Regarding the idea of a permanent tax cut , Indiana Sen . 
Mike Braun later told CNN , " It â€™s probably something I would not do . " 
Trump 's top economic advisers who accompanied him to the lunch have also raised the idea of paid family sick leave and targeted relief for industries hardest hit by the outbreak , like hotels , airlines and cruises . 
Leaving the lunch today , Trump offered no details on the discussions , but said , " You 'll be hearing about it soon . "
