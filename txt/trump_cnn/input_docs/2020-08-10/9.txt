California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said that President Trump ’s unemployment proposal , which would require states to pitch in 25 % of a $ 400 benefit , would cost the state approximately $ 700 million each week . 
Newsom acknowledged that a $ 400 benefit rather than the current $ 600 weekly payment would be advantageous for those Californians who are otherwise looking at nothing . 
He warned that it would add to the " enormous economic stress " already menacing the California 's government . 
" We are at peril of being in a position where we ’re making false commitments , false promises , " Newsom said .
