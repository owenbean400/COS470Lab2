Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denied President Trump��s claim that Democrats called him to resume negotiations , and said he has not seen any evidence that the President is personally involved in the negotiations for the next coronavirus relief bill . 
Schumer went on to say , " I ’ve seen zero evidence that he ’s involved at all . " 
Schumer noted that during negotiations over the last stimulus bill he spoke to the President , but said that they have not spoken since . 
" He just makes things up , " Schumer said of the President ’s executive actions over the weekend , adding that he thinks Trump 's measures are " laughable . " 
Schumer also criticized Trump ’s Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow ’s appearance on CNN ’s State of the Union yesterday , saying Kudlow " had no idea what the executive order actually said . " 
But Schumer also presented an optimistic view of how negotiations could now move forward in light of the President ’s executive actions this weekend . 
" It may well be that the Republicans are willing to now sit down with us because they see what they were hanging their hat on , these executive orders , are just being more or less regarded at best as ineffective , " Schumer said .
