President Trump suggested Thursday that he did not consult European leaders before announcing US travel restrictions on 26 European countries related to novel coronavirus because it would have taken too long . 
The President also suggested the lack of communication was justified because European countries do not inform him when they raise taxes on the US . 
" But we had to move quickly . 
I mean , when they raise taxes on us , they do not consult us and I think that â€™s probably one in the same , " he continued .
