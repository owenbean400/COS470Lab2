With the coronavirus outbreak reaching pandemic proportions , Jared Kushner is stepping in to help advise President Trump on the administration ’s efforts . 
Kushner , Trump ’s son in law and senior adviser , has become more involved in the last few days , joining the President for several meetings on the topic and huddling with other top advisers about the administration ’s response , a White House official and other sources familiar with the matter said . 
One Trump ally said Kushner is becoming more involved because of concerns about how the administration ’s coronavirus task force – now headed by Vice President Mike Pence – is being run . 
But there is also some quiet eye rolling among some Trump allies who point out it was Kushner urging the President last month to downplay the situation when coronavirus concerns first caused selloffs on Wall Street . 
Some context : Kushner is stepping in as White House officials and others close to the President described a distinct shift in the President ’s demeanor and approach to the coronavirus pandemic in the last 48 hours , recognizing privately that his administration needs to do more amid a plummeting stock market and spiking cases of coronavirus in the US . 
Kushner ’s new role also comes at a time when his power inside the West Wing is at a premium . 
Outgoing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has been diminished and the incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows is in self quarantine and has yet to set foot at the White House . 
One Trump adviser said Kushner is now " in total control . " 
A White House official pushed back on Kushner ’s status , arguing that Kushner is merely stepping in at a time when the coronavirus fight has become the top priority at the White House .
