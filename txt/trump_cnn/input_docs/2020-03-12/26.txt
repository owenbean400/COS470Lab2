House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that House Democrats still plan to bring their legislative coronavirus response package to the floor for a vote today , even as she noted that talks are ongoing with the White House in an effort to reach a consensus deal . 
" Today we ’ll bring to the floor our Families First legislation , " she said at her weekly news conference . 
She said Democrats are " addressing " some Republican concerns in their coronavirus response legislation , saying the Trump administration ’s suggestions are all " very reasonable . " 
But she pushed back on House Minority Leader Kevin Mc Carthy ’s suggestion that the House stay in session instead of leaving for a week long recess in order to further negotiate changes to the coronavirus legislation . 
" We do not need 48 hours . 
We need to just make a decision to help families right now , " Pelosi said during her presser , after Mc Carthy said in a news conference right before hers that he thinks the House should stay in session to reach a deal and is optimistic that could get done in the next 24 to 48 hours . 
" We are responding to their concerns , we do not want them moving the goal posts , and that ’s it , " she said . 
" I ’m not sticking around because they do not want to agree to language . " 
She said members who have complaints should " save it for another day , " and for future legislation , arguing that now is the time to find common ground . 
Pelosi also left the door open for other legislative initiatives that might be negotiated with the administration , saying , " there will be other initiatives that we want to work with the administration on that may be necessary as we go forward . 
Some that need more discussion . " 
Pelosi also talked about congressional offices ’ preparation to work remotely .
