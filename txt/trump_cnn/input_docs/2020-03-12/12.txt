If United States officials are clear about one thing as they scramble to respond to the worsening coronavirus pandemic , it 's where they feel the blame lies . 
Addressing the nation on Wednesday night , President Donald Trump emphasized that the " foreign virus " began " in China . " 
His comments come after multiple US lawmakers and officials have criticized Beijing 's initial handling of the outbreak , or pointedly referred to the coronavirus as the " Wuhan virus " or " China virus . " 
Speaking earlier in the day , Trump 's national security adviser Robert O 'Brien said that " this virus did not originate in the United States , it originated in Wuhan in Hubei province in China . " 
These statements could not have come at a worse time for Beijing , just as it is attempting to reframe the narrative around its response to the virus as one of success , and take something of a victory lap . 
New infections have slowed to a trickle , thanks largely to China 's -- albeit often draconian , extreme -- response in recent weeks . 
Those moves however came as a rearguard action to a widely criticized initial response , including an apparent cover up by officials in Wuhan , which may have cost precious time to rein in the virus before it spread through the country and the world . 
While there was a brief reckoning in China over these mistakes , particularly in the wake of the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang , Beijing has begun pushing back hard against any criticism overseas and censoring discussion at home . 
State media has also started pushing the line that there is uncertainty where the virus originated , even though the first outbreak was undoubtedly in Wuhan . 
With US officials apparently determined to lay the blame at Beijing 's door -- distracting from their own handling of the outbreak at home -- and their Chinese counterparts equally determined to avoid it , this argument will likely continue for some time .
