Private jet companies have seen a surge in demand in the hours since the Europe travel ban was announced by President Trump . 
Adam Twidell , CEO of on demand private jet charter provider Private Fly , says the company is receiving a " significant number of requests " from Americans currently in Europe who are seeking to return to the US , as well as those who want to fly from Europe to the UK , which is exempt from the ban at present . 
Remember : The ban Trump announced last night applies only to foreign nationals — and not American citizens and permanent residents who 'd be screened before entering the country . 
Still there was confusion after the announcement , prompting people to reach out to private jet companies . 
" Overall the inquiries we ’re getting are from people very concerned to get their families back together as soon as possible , given how rapidly the situation is developing , " Twidell tells CNN . 
Private Fly , along with similar providers , had already noted a boost in bookings due to the coronavirus outbreak , which has resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights . 
Last week , US based Paramount Business Jets revealed they were experiencing anywhere from 100 % to 300 % increases for charter requests depending on the region .
