President Trump announced tonight that all travel from Europe to the United States will be suspended for the next 30 days , except for the UK . 
Trump made the decision in order to " keep new cases from entering our shores . " 
He said the new rule will go into effect beginning Friday at midnight . 
Trump said there will be certain exemptions made for certain Americans " who have undergone appropriate screenings . " 
" These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo , but various other things as we get approval . 
Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing . 
These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom , " Trump added . 
Watch : This post has been updated to clarify that Trump said the US is restricting travel from Europe , though the effect of the one way ban will likely have broader ramifications for US travelers .
