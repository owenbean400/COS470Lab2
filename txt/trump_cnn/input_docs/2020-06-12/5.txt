President Trump is planning a rally in Oklahoma next week , but Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious disease expert , warned there ’s a risk of either " acquiring or spreading " the deadly coronavirus for those who attend . 
Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room on Friday that he has not personally talked to Trump about the planned rally or the risks involved with mass gatherings at this point . 
" When you are in a large crowd — if you have the congregation of people that are much , much close to each other — you definitely increase the risk that you will either acquire or spread infections . " 
Fauci said people are going to gather , despite the warnings . 
" But the issue is , if they do , please wear a mask , all the time , because the mask will give you some protection . 
The best thing to do is to avoid crowded areas , but if you 're not going to do that , please wear a mask , " he said .
