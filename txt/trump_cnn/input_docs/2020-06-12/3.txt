As the coronavirus pandemic continues , officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are reiterating the importance of social distancing , wearing face coverings in public and washing hands frequently . 
Their announcement to keep following guidelines comes at a time when President Trump plans to hold a rally and has not been wearing a face covering in public . 
" The good news is , nationally , we have been successful in flattening the curve , the number of new cases , each day has been relatively plateaued over a prolonged period of time , " Butler said . 
" But right now communities are experiencing different levels of transmission . 
And this is occurring as they gradually ease up on some of the community mitigation efforts , and gradually reopen , " Butler said . 
" We continue to ask everyone to follow the guidance . " 
CDC officials plan to release more guidelines today . 
CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield also said during the call that continuing to follow this guidance remains critical . 
" CDC ’s Covid 19 response is now in its sixth month and while we ’re making real progress we still have a lot of work ahead as we reopen America , " Redfield said .
