" The world is divided , " World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news conference in Geneva today . 
Addressing the coronavirus pandemic , Tedros said , " This is a very dangerous virus . 
And it 's very hard to fight this kind of virus in a divided world . " 
Tedros said the impact on global health has been large , but some social impacts are even more serious . 
" Millions have lost their jobs , and we know many have lost their livelihoods , " he said adding a very small virus is creating havoc . 
" This should be a humbling moment , " Tedros said . 
" We need to really reflect and see humility as the main way to get out of this problem for any individual person or any nation . " 
Some background : President Trump has stood firm in his threats to halt funding to the organization . 
Last month he told the agency he will permanently pull US funding if it does not " commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days . "
