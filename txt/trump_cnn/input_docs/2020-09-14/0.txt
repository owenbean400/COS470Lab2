Despite the global coronavirus pandemic , US President Donald Trump tops the list of things Germans fear the most , according to a survey published by the country 's largest insurance group last week . 
The annual poll into the fears of people living in Germany shows that 53 % of respondents are concerned by the consequences of ' ' a more dangerous world due to the politics of Trump , " putting the US president at the top of their list of worries . 
This is the second time since 2018 that Trump tops the survey , which is carried out by insurance group R+V . 
" This year , the fear of a serious illness is surprisingly small , although it is dominated by corona , " said Brigitte Roemstedt , head of R+V 's information center , in a company statement . 
The poll found that 32 % of Germans worry about catching a serious illness -- compared to 35 % in 2019 -- before the coronavirus outbreak began to spread . 
Roemstedt added ' ' only about one in three respondents is afraid that they themselves or people around them could become infected with coronavirus . ' ' The survey also showed that 42 % of Germans believe that globalization could cause more pandemics , and 51 % said they are concerned about the economic fallout of the coronavirus . 
The annual R+V survey has been conducted since 1992 . 
Researchers ask people about their greatest personal , political , economic and environmental fears . 
For this year 's study 2,400 people participated in June and July 2020 , according to R+V .
