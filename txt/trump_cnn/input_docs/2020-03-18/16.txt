President Trump was pressed Wednesday on why he is calling coronavirus the " Chinese Virus , " amid instances of bigotry against Asian Americans . 
He did not indicate that he will stop calling it that , and claimed that he is using the term because China tried to blame the virus on US soldiers . 
" Cause it comes from China . 
It ’s not racist at all , no , not at all . 
It comes from China , that ’s why . 
I want to be accurate , " Trump said . 
Pressed again , he said , " I have great love for all of the people from our country , but as you know China tried to say at one point … that it was caused by American soldiers . 
That ca not happen , it ’s not gonna happen , not as long as I ’m president . 
It comes from China . "
