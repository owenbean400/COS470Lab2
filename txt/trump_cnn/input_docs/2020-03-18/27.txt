The US Senate is now voting on the House passed coronavirus relief legislation that includes provisions for free testing for COVID 19 and paid emergency leave . 
Once the Senate approves the measure it will go to President Trump for his signature . 
Trump expressed support for the package last week , paving the way for a broad bipartisan vote in the House . 
Passage will also allow the Senate to devote its full attention to passing the next relief package in response to the coronavirus crisis . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell and other Senate Republicans have been critical of the House passed legislation , but have emphasized that it is urgent to get relief to the American people amid the coronavirus crisis . 
Mc Connell reiterated today that he will not adjourn the Senate until it passes what lawmakers are describing as a " phase three " economic stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak . 
After an initial vote last week , the House approved a set of changes to the legislation on Monday , clearing the path for the Senate to take it up this week .
