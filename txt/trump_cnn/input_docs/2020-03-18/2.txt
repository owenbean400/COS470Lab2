The White House Office of Management and Budget submitted an emergency funding request to the US Congress tonight for an additional $ 45.8 billion in the face of a pandemic . 
The sweeping request for new funds and statutory authority came on the same day the Trump administration presented a $ 1 trillion stimulus proposal on Capitol Hill . 
" With the pandemic growing , resource needs have also grown , " Russell Vought , the acting OMB director , wrote in a letter attached to the 118 page request that was sent to lawmakers late Tuesday night . 
Why this matters : The request comes on top the $ 8.3 billion in emergency funding passed by Congress just two weeks ago -- underscoring just how dramatically financial demands at federal agencies have grown in a matter of days . 
The request is also viewed by the administration as coming in tandem with the large scale economic stimulus negotiation , which are expected to have a price tag north of $ 1 trillion , currently underway on Capitol Hill . 
The package is not a complete single solution : It 's not meant to be a " broad based solution to the major economic dislocation wrought by the virus , nor is it the primary means by which the Federal Government plans to address the hardships of families , individuals , and communities who have been touched by the disease , " Vought wrote . 
" We are currently in active dialogue with the Congress on additional proposals that speak to these broader , vital issues . " 
Negotiators are planning to include the emergency funding request in the stimulus package currently being discussed , congressional aides tell CNN .
