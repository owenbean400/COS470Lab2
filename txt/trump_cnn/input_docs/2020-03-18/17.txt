President Trump says he sees the country on wartime footing and himself as a " wartime president " amid a raging coronavirus crisis . 
" I do , " Trump said when asked if he sees the country at war with the disease . 
" I 'm looking at it that way . " 
" I mean , that 's what we 're fighting . 
I mean , it 's a very tough situation here , " he went on . 
" You have to do things . 
You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they 've ever been . 
We had the best economy we 've ever had . 
And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy , and , but we 're doing it and we 're doing it well . " 
Trump praised the nation 's citizens for their response . 
" The American people have been incredible â€” for the most part , " he said .
