Whether you test positive or negative for the novel coronavirus , " we should be acting as if we have the virus , " US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said on NBC this morning . 
Speaking to the importance of following mitigation measures during the current coronavirus outbreak , Adams said that any person who feels sick should stay home — and testing negative for the virus should not change that . 
Adams added : " You should not change your approach to mitigation measures based on a positive or a negative test . 
You could test negative and still be early in the incubation period and still spread coronavirus . " 
Earlier this week : During a White House briefing yesterday , Vice President Mike Pence noted that while testing for the novel coronavirus is becoming more widely available , the actions of people in the United States should take remain the same , even if they ca not get a test . 
" You do not need the results of testing to know what you should do , " Pence said , urging everyone in the country to follow the principles in the Trump administration ’s 15 day plan to slow new infections in the US . 
The plan , announced Monday , offers more stringent recommendations about staying home and avoiding groups of 10 people or more , among other things .
