President Trump was asked about Dr . Deborah Birx 's warning regarding millennial coronavirus and his message to many of his own young , conservative supporters who may be heeding his earlier advice downplaying the seriousness of coronavirus . 
He claimed his earlier comments were " to be calm . " 
" I do want people to be calm , " he said . 
But , he added , " I hope they just listen to what we ’ve been saying over the last period of time . 
We do not want them gathering , and I see that they do gather including on beaches , and including in restaurants , young people . 
They do not realize that — they ’re feeling invincible , I do not know if you felt invincible when you were young . 
But they do not realize that they could be carrying lots of bad things home to their grandmother and grandfather and even their parents , " he said . 
He continued , " So we want them to heed the advice … and I do believe it ’s getting through . " 
Asked again about those who are not following that advice , he reiterated , " Heed the advice , heed the advice , I just said . "
