President Trump was pressed Wednesday by CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins on the ventilator shortage at the nation ’s hospitals . 
Asked why it took so long if the US knew it needed more ventilators , he said , " Well we knew – it depends , it depends on how it goes , worst case , absolutely , best case , not at all . 
So we ’re going to have to see where it goes . 
But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators and they ’re complex . 
These are complex machines . " 
Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence how many ventilators the US has . 
" We have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile . 
It ’s in excess of 10,000 . 
And you just heard the announcement from the Department of Defense , they ’ll be adding several more thousand to that , " he said , adding that that number does not count all of the ventilators that exist in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around the country . 
Pence went on to praise the " tremendous spirit " among industry leaders who are " ready to step in and add to that volume .
