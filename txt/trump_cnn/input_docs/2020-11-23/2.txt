US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that distribution of Regeneron ’s Covid 19 antibody therapy will begin Tuesday . 
The therapy has been given an emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration to be used in patients age 12 and older who have a mild to moderate case of Covid 19 and who are at a high risk of progressing to a more severe form of the disease . 
President Donald Trump received the therapy , called REGEN COV2 , when he was hospitalized for coronavirus . 
The treatment has to be infused into the bloodstream and is meant to mimic an immune response to infection . 
Azar said there will be 30,000 doses of the Regeneron treatment ready to go out Tuesday , with more to come in the next few weeks . 
Americans wo not be charged for the drug itself , Azar said . 
HHS is working with payers to cover the cost of the administration of the drug . 
Azar also called the emergency use authorization of Regeneron ’s treatment " incredibly exciting news . " 
There is also an Eli Lilly antibody treatment being used under an emergency use authorization that helps patients with mild to moderate forms of Covid 19 . 
In the last two weeks , more than 85,000 patient courses of the Lilly product have been delivered to more than 2,400 sites around the country , Azar said . 
Azar added that while there has been good news about vaccines and antibody treatments lately , Americans still need to remain vigilant to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus . 
" Encouraging news about vaccines and therapeutics should be all the more reason for Americans to double down on the measures like masks , hand washing and social distancing , that we need to beat this pandemic , " Azar said . 
He also encouraged those who are within three months of recovery from Covid 19 to donate their plasma to provide convalescent plasma treatments to Covid 19 patients .
