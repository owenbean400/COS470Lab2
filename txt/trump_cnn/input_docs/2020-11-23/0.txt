Dr . Len Schleifer , the president and CEO of drugmaker Regeneron , explained the company ’s decision to let President Donald Trump use their antibody cocktail . 
When Trump contracted Covid 19 in early October , Regeneron granted him compassionate use for their treatment , REGEN COV2 . 
It was still an experimental treatment ; human clinical trails began in June , and the first encouraging data from patients came just three days before Trump announced he had Covid 19 . 
While they knew it would bring unprecedented scrutiny on the company , Schleifer said , " Frankly , that ’s not the kind of calculation we do in these moments . 
Rather we considered if it was the right thing to do for the patient and if it adhered to our policies and ethical standards . 
In this case , it was , and it did . " 
REGEN COV2 was granted an emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration on Saturday .
