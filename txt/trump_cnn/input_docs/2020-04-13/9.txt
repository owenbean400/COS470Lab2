South Dakota will be the first state to conduct a hydroxychloroquine trial to test against Covid 19 , Gov . 
Kristi Noem announced Monday . 
She announced the trial in a series of tweets . 
" We ’ve received the initial doses we need , " Noem said . 
" We ’re now the first state to do a full clinical trial to test whether hydroxychloroquine can treat and perhaps prevent # COVID19 . " 
About the drug hydroxychloroquine : The drug is used to treat malaria , lupus and rheumatoid arthritis . 
Trump has touted the drug , saying it shows " tremendous promise " of working against coronavirus as well . 
But the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is not sponsoring any studies on hydroxychloroquine , according to a statement from the agency , which added that the agency is " considering " trials that examine the drug or its analogue chloroquine as a potential treatment for Covid 19 studies . 
On its website , NIAID mentions several drug therapies it is supporting to fight coronavirus , but not hydroxychloroquine . 
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , another federal agency , also lists its coronavirus measures on its website , but hydroxychloroquine is not among them . 
Despite Trump 's enthusiasm , a federal government registry for clinical trials shows only two trials in the US for hydroxychloroquine to fight coronavirus , and only one of those is up and running .
