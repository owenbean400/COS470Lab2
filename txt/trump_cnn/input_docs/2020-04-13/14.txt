Connecticut Gov . 
Ned Lamont told reporters Monday President Trump and his team are " always asking the governors , what their priorities are and how we ’re thinking about getting things reopened . " 
" So I do not really think they 're going to try and mandate a one size fits all , as it was referred to previously , for all 50 states , " he said . 
" We ’re in very different situations and we 're all going to address the slow reopening of our states in a thoughtful way , each state being a little bit different . " 
Lamont said a " Reopen Connecticut Advisory Board " will be created , which will include Dr . Albert Ko , Yale ’s leading epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist , along with other experts from business and science , with a focus on health outcomes , analytics , clinical lab work , and mobile technology .
