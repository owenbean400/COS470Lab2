New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said that the coronavirus death toll has made him cry . 
On Howard Stern 's radio show this morning , Cuomo reiterated that President Trump has been accessible and quick to provide the state what it needs , adding that the President has also asked about the health of his brother , CNN anchor Chris Cuomo . 
He said of Trump : " He can be vicious in attacks . 
Again , he 's a New Yorker , right ? 
And he has felt the sharp end of the spear as a New Yorker , and he can attack , " Cuomo said . 
" The President has always makes a point of saying to me , ' how is Chris , is he doing okay , ' and that 's not in his usual character , you know . 
We are not chit chatty when we are on the phone . 
But he always makes a point to say that about Chris and always remembers my mother , " he said . 
Cuomo said he talks to the President several times a week . 
He was also asked about the conflicting messages on school closures between him and the New York City mayor Bill de Blasio – who has said he wants to keep schools closed until the end of the year – and reiterated that there is always a bit of tension between local and state government . 
While he understands the position , Cuomo echoed his weekend comments that overall a uniform school closure policy is ideal .
