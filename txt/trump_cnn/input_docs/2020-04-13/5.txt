A source close to the White House tells CNN that President Trump has been calling allies and associates all weekend , complaining about recent media reports about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Trump thinks " everybody is trying make themselves look good , " the source said . 
In particular , Trump has been fixated on two government officials at the center of the response : Dr . Anthony Fauci and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar . 
Trump is clearly trying to make Fauci uncomfortable , a tactic he uses with many of his top officials , the official said . 
Part of the problem , the source said , is that some in the president 's circle have been criticizing Fauci , paining the doctor as somehow aligned with the Clintons . 
Trump surrogates have been spreading negative stories about Fauci in recent days , attempting to portray the doctor as party responsible for the government 's response to the virus , to deflect criticism from the president . 
White House officials have insisted Trump has confidence in Fauci . 
Last Friday , Trump defended his medical experts at the coronavirus task force press conference . 
But he stopped short of telling his allies to cease their political attacks on Fauci and the other top doctor on the task force , Deborah Birx . 
The source went on to say that Trump is quickly losing patience with Azar , who has been the subject of speculation for weeks that the cabinet member may be on thin ice with the White House . 
Trump believes Azar 's aides were partly behind a scathing New York Times piece on Trump 's response to the virus , the source said . 
This source added Trump is particularly frustrated with the criticism that he could have acted sooner .
