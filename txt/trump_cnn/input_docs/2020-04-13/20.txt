President Trump said he will ask for a " major delay " to the 2020 Census to make sure it is completed safely and accurately . 
Trump said that the Census Bureau will ask Congress for a 120 day extension — an extension he feels is not long enough . 
" In addition as millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online , the Census Bureau asked Congress for a 120 day extension . 
I do not know if you even have to ask them . 
This is called an act of God . 
This is called a situation that has to be — they have to give it and I think 120 days is not nearly enough , " Trump said . 
Why the Census Bureau is asking for an extension : The late revisions to the census data collection timeline means officials need more time to compile the data that is used to apportion members of Congress among the states , as well as the data that states use to draw congressional districts . 
Federal law requires some of that data be compiled before the end of this year , so being granted the extension would allow the final counts to be delivered to the President in April and July of 2021 .
