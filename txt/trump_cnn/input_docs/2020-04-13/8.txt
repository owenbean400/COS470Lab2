South Korea will begin sending Covid 19 testing kits to the US as soon as tomorrow afternoon , an official with South Korea ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN . 
Earlier today , Foreign Minister Kang Kyung wha said in an interview with France 24 said the country will send 600,000 test kits to the US . 
It is unclear how many kits of the 600,000 could be sent tomorrow . 
South Korea ’s ability to test large numbers of people in a short period of time has been a major contributing factor in its success in combating the virus . 
Kang said the tests received preliminary FDA approval " as a result of conversation between my president and President Trump last month . 
I think the contracts have been signed and they should be ready for shipment anytime soon . 
" Trump and Moon Jae in spoke on the phone last month about the pandemic , and Trump had requested assistance procuring medical equipment from South Korea . 
Sol Gent , the first South Korean coronavirus test kit manufacturer to register for stockpile procurement by FEMA , told CNN on Monday that the company had already shipped 150,000 new coronavirus test kits to the US last week . 
Sol Gent could not comment if these kits were included in the 600,000 Foreign Affairs Minister Kang referred to , and it is unclear how many of the 600,000 will be sent tomorrow .
