Black Americans are at a higher risk for coronavirus . 
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot wants to begin addressing this by collecting the data first . 
" There was a recorder of the information being put out by providers where they essentially skipped filling in race , ethnicity and other demographic information that was important for us to really measure the full impact , " she said . 
Providing that information is now mandatory . 
A racial equity rapid response team comes next , where health care providers , public health officials and community based organizations go into hyperlocal communities to research . 
Lightfoot also criticized the Trump administration for its efforts to " kill the Affordable Care Act , " saying that coronavirus claims those with underlying conditions so health care should be more accessible to people . 
" If you want to help this community , what you do is you expand access to affordable high quality health care . 
You do not try to kill it . "
