President Trump 's economic adviser Larry Kudlow called today a " rough day " for markets when he appeared on Fox Business today — but he added that it is not the " last word " and downplayed the threat of a second wave of coronavirus . 
Kudlow was asked about market reaction to concerns about another spike of cases in the fall . 
Pressed on the fact that there have been 100,000 cases in the last week , he said he is " not a medical expert , " and suggested it was because " we are testing much more . " 
He also said hospitalizations have increased because elective surgeries have resumed . 
Kudlow said they are " looking at a lot of options " for additional stimulus funding , but he would not get into specifics . 
During a very brief gaggle with reporters , he suggested there ’s consensus for a tourism stimulus in some form . 
" Could be a deduction , could be a credit , could be a refundable credit , " he said , adding , " There seems to be a very broad agreement with congressional members that would be a good thing to do . "
