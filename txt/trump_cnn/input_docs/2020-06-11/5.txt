As ongoing national protests bring Americans physically closer together , actor and activist Sean Penn is helping to provide Covid 19 testing kits . 
Penn 's organization CORE ( Community Organized Relief Effort ) began by providing tests sites in Los Angeles , and has since moved the model across the county . 
" All of the people that work for CORE , throughout the country , are people from those communities who we train , " said Penn , who noted that the fear of another Covid 19 spike on the heels of organized marches is very real . 
" The scientists are very worried about that and I certainly am prone to align myself with their concerns , " Penn said . 
Penn , who started his organization following the 2010 earthquakes in Haiti , sees helping protesters stay healthy as a way of supporting another critical cause . 
He said they " hope to see a return on that in the sense that protesters participate , participate at six feet distance in the lines with masks and that we 're able to offer them the assistance that they 're offering the greater republic . " 
As the Trump administration is hesitant to support and promote many of the health measures being encouraged by health experts , the two time Academy Award winner quickly noted that examples of empowering change occur outside of Washington , DC . 
" I think we should see by now that we 're not going to get our lead from leadership , " said Penn , adding " this is time for citizens to take the lead , and unfortunately in particular citizens of color are taking that lead , and we are looking to support , assist , coordinate with them in every way that is represented by peaceful protest and scientific , fact based testing .
