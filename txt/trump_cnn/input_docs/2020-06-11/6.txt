Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , expressed support for the World Health Organization Thursday but declined to criticize President Trump ’s announcement that he was severing ties with the organization . 
" I ’ve been dealing with the WHO now for four decades . 
I have a number of colleagues I have interacted with and continue to . 
I have a very good relationship with the director general of WHO , " Fauci told the CBC . 
" The WHO is an imperfect organization . 
It certainly has made some missteps but it has also done a lot of good . 
The world needs a WHO , " added Fauci , who is also a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force . 
" I would hope that we would continue to benefit from what the WHO can do — at the same time that they continue to improve themselves . " 
More on this : Last week , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield said his agency continues to have close collaboration with WHO , despite Trump ’s statements . 
Redfield said during a House Appropriations hearing on the Covid 19 response that the CDC has been working with WHO as recently as the last couple of days . 
In the CBC interview , Fauci also declined to say whether he thought the US border with Canada should remain closed . 
" I am not an expert on closing and opening borders , " he said . 
" What you would like to see under any circumstances … would be to see a significant diminution , consistently , in the number of cases , hospitalizations and deaths . " 
He said that appeared to be happening but said he was worried about potential recent increases in deaths .
