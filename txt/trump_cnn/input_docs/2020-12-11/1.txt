After a series of last minute holdups , the Senate just passed a one week stop gap funding bill by voice vote to avert a government shutdown at midnight tonight . 
The bill will next go to President Trump for his signature . 
The short term spending bill would extend government funding by a week to Dec . 18 and is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to reach an agreement on Covid relief and broader funding legislation for a new fiscal year . 
It passed the House earlier this week . 
The Senate needed to pass the short term government funding bill sometime during the day Friday ahead of the funding expiration deadline to avert a shutdown , but lawmakers have been dealing with a series of holdups that had thrown a timeline for a vote into question .
