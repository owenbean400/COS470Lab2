President Trump has signed a one week stopgap funding bill by voice vote to avert a government shutdown at midnight . 
The bill was passed by the Senate earlier Friday . 
Some background : The short term spending bill would extend government funding by a week to Dec . 18 and is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to reach an agreement on Covid relief and broader funding legislation for a new fiscal year . 
It passed the House earlier this week . 
So far , however , stimulus talks remain at an impasse over critical sticking points , creating uncertainty over whether an agreement can be reached . 
Lawmakers now have just one additional week to work out thorny issues that are currently holding up an agreement or potentially witness the collapse of the talks .
