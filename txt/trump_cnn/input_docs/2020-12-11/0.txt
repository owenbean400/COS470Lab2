The 116th Congress is entering a make or break moment : It can either collapse in a colossal failure or it can all come together quickly to give struggling Americans some desperately needed relief . 
And now there 's a possibility this Congress can end how it began : in a government shutdown . 
While there are some signs of progress on state and local aid in bipartisan relief talks , prospects are still grim for Congress to get a deal both sides can live with , get drafted quickly and jammed through Congress — and then onto the desk of a mercurial President who has had no role in the negotiations but can upend them at any given moment . 
Here 's what we 're watching today : Leaders need to start talking : To get a deal done by next week , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell need to come to terms quickly . 
But they are not even talking with each other and instead are bitterly trading blame as the leadership remains at sharp odds about what can even pass , meaning there 's no guarantee any deal reached by a bipartisan group of lawmakers will even get through Congress . 
Why today is crucial : Friday is turning out to be a critical day on two fronts : Both on the Covid relief talks and to keep the government from shutting down for the fourth time in President Trump 's time in office . 
Sticking points on stimulus : The snafu over the stopgap portends the challenges ahead for much thornier issues — namely on a Covid relief package that has dogged Congress for several months in addition to the $ 1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill to fund the federal government through September 2021 , a massive proposal that the two sides have struggled to finalize , prompting leaders to try to pass the week long continuing resolution . 
The bipartisan group of senators and House members that have tried to finalize a deal are expected to release legislative language today on their $ 160 billion deal to aid states and cities hit hard by the pandemic , resolving a key sticking point , aides said . 
But there 's one big problem : Most GOP senators detest that aid — and Mc Connell has warned that most Republicans wo not support it , meaning it 's unlikely to pass the Senate .
