President Trump 's trade adviser Peter Navarro fired off an internal flare at the White House in late January , warning in a memo that the coronavirus could become a " full blown pandemic , " risking trillions of dollars in economic losses and the health of millions , a source familiar with the memo confirmed to CNN . 
In the first memo , Navarro pushed for a travel ban on China — something he and other officials had begun lobbying for weeks earlier — and " aggressive " containment efforts . 
Less than a month later , as Trump continued to downplay the threat , Navarro warned that the risk of a pandemic was rising and urged the White House 's coronavirus task force to secure billions in supplemental spending , according to two sources familiar with the second memo . 
The sources confirmed the authenticity of both memos , which were first reported by the New York Times and Axios . 
In the first memo , Navarro warned of a worst case scenario in which a half million Americans could die . 
In the second , he warned the risk was growing to imperil the loss of 1.2 million lives . 
Some context : The memos are the latest piece of evidence that undercuts Trump 's insistence at the time that the administration had the situation under control and his more recent claims that the pandemic the US now faces was " unforeseen . "
