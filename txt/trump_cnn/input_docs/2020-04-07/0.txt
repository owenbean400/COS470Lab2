A crewmember of the USNS Comfort tested positive for coronavirus , and has been isolated from patients and other crew members , a Navy spokesperson said Tuesday . 
The US Navy hospital ship is currently docked in New York City harbor and had originally been designated as a space for non coronavirus patients to alleviate the pressure from New York hospitals . 
On Sunday , President Trump said it could be used for coronavirus patients if needed . 
Walsh said the crewmember had no contact with patients . 
A US defense official tells CNN , " those who had contact with the crew member who tested positive have been tested and will remain in isolation for several days regardless of the test result , out of an abundance of caution . " 
The US military announced Monday night that the Comfort will take patients regardless of whether they tested positive for Covid 19 . 
" Effective immediately , USNS COMFORT will accept trauma , emergency and urgent care patients without regard to their COVID status . 
The Javits New York Medical Station continues to be Do D 's [ the Department of Defense ] primary facility for COVID 19 patients , " Walsh said . 
A Navy official told CNN that the directive to treat coronavirus patients means the Comfort will now have half the capacity it would otherwise have , because of the need to separate COVID and non COVID patients .
