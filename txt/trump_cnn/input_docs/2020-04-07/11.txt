If North Carolina stops social distancing at the end of April -- as President Donald Trump and administration officials have pushed for -- there could be 750,000 state residents infected by June , said state health officials . 
The North Carolina specific modeling forecast showed that if the state stopped social distancing by the end of this month , there is more than a 50 % probability that the state will outstrip ICU bed capability and acute care capacity -- even as early as May . 
On the other hand , if social distancing stayed in effect , it could cut the number of infections by half a million cases -- down to 250,000 . 
North Carolina now has 2,870 cases and 33 deaths , said Cohen .
