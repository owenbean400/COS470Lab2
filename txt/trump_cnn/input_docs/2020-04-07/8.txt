House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her colleagues in conference calls Tuesday the House may have to move this week on the small business loan package requested by the Trump administration , sources on the calls said . 
Another source said Pelosi is making clear she is willing to move forward this week on the package if she gets a deal with the administration , which wants $ 250B for small business loans . 
Democrats have made a number of requests to be included in this $ 250 billion package , including protections for renters and minority business owners . 
It â€™s still not clear what Pelosi will ultimately demand of the administration . 
Pelosi has made clear this small business loan package is only an interim package , and they still to plan to move forward with another plan -- called CARES 2 -- in the coming weeks .
