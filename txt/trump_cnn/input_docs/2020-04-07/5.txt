President Donald Trump met by telephone with leaders from the banking industry Tuesday about Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses after the program had rocky rollout . 
The program was initially met with confusion and a bit of pushback from some banks who claimed they did not have enough information about the program , or guarantees that they would ultimately be paid back by the government . 
JP Morgan Chase told its customers last week it would not be able to start accepting applications for the loan when the program rolled out Friday , because it was " still awaiting guidance from the SBA and the US Treasury . " 
But that confusion seemed to be cleared up by Tuesday , when the bank ’s Chief Operating Officer Gordon Smith thanked the SBA and Treasury Department for working with the bank " seven days a week late , late into the night in very close partnership to make sure that we could deliver the program . " 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters the issues were due to " a lot of new users coming onto the system . " 
" They ’re all getting authenticated . 
We ’ll get them all approved , " he said . 
During the meeting , Trump acknowledged that there had been a few issues , but wrote them off as normal . 
" There are a few glitches , very few , " the President said . 
" Any little glitch we had worked out within minutes . 
Within hours . 
There were a couple , a little on applications . 
They wanted to work it a little bit differently , banks had some suggestions and it was all done probably I would say 100 % of it in the first day . " 
Work on a new round of payouts for small businesses is already in the works , Trump and Mnuchin said .
