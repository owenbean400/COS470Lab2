" The President is taking action to undermine the oversight of the legislation , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said while discussing more government aid for Americans during the coronavirus pandemic . 
In an interview with CNN ’s Anderson Cooper , Pelosi called President Trump ’s removal of the independent watchdog tasked with overseeing coronavirus emergency funds " a problem . " 
" The President thinks he should be the only one [ overseeing the fund ] , and that ’s exactly upside down , " she said . 
" It ’s not geared to the President . 
It is geared to how the program is implemented , " she added . 
" And where there ’s money , there ’ll always…be some skullduggery . " 
Pelosi also praised the $ 2 trillion bipartisan package passed in March and opened up the possibility of Americans receiving more than the now-$1,200 direct payments . 
" We wanted more . 
So we think that there ’s a path to getting more for the direct payments for the American people , " Pelosi said when asked about Sen . 
Bernie Sanders ’ remarks that every American should continue to receive normal paychecks during the pandemic . 
When asked about the price tag for another stimulus bill in addition to the $ 2 trillion one , she said " we ’ll evaluate as we go along .
