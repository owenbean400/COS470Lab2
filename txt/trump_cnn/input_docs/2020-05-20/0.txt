US President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his use of hydroxychloroquine -- a drug that is unproven to prevent coronavirus -- and called research warning of its risks a " phony study . " 
Trump particularly bashed a US study of patients he claimed were too sick and old . 
Trump claimed that the study was conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs . 
It was in fact funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia but conducted in VA hospitals . 
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie did make the distinction in the cabinet meeting ; however , he also promoted the drug and said it ’s been used by the VA in large quantities for many health issues . 
" I want to clear up something … that was not a VA study , " Wilkie told reporters . 
" Researchers took VA numbers and they did not clinically review them , they were not peer reviewed . 
They did not even look at what the President just mentioned the various comorbidities . " 
What other studies say : The research Trump was alluding to is not the only study of its kind warning of the risks of hydroxychloroquine . 
The Journal of the American Medical Association published a new study last week , the largest of its kind , that shows that hydroxychloroquine does not work against Covid 19 and could cause heart problems . 
That follows another study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing similar results . 
What Trump says : Trump claimed that the drug " does not seem to have any impact " on him , saying " it is has gotten tremendous reviews . " 
" It ’s gotten a bad reputation only because I ’m promoting it , " Trump told reporters , adding , " If anyone else was promoting it , they ’d say this is the greatest thing ever . "
