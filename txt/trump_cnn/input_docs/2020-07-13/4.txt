House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC Monday discussed the prospect of reopening schools in the coming months as the coronavirus pandemic surges around the country , raising fears about safety . 
In the interview , she said the " biggest concern is safety " and called for Congress to approve funding for schools to adjust to the pandemic , including broadband provisions for low income students to allow remote learning . 
" Without the resources , we should not even be thinking about sending them back to school , " Pelosi said . 
She also reiterated her call for President Trump to implement the Defense Production Act to manufacture personal protective equipment . 
Pelosi said effective testing is essential for the United States to move forward . 
" There ’s no use in taking a test if you ’re not going to get your results until a week later , " she said . 
Asked about the plight of American schoolchildren who face domestic abuse situations at home or who do not have food security and rely on school to eat breakfast and lunch , Pelosi said addressing their needs is " something we have always fought for . " 
But , she added , " it ’s not a question of balancing equities , it ’s a question of crossing a threshold of safety . "
