White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany would not answer why the White House anonymously released a statement attempting to discredit Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert . 
Asked by CNN â€™s Jim Acosta why the White House put out an opposition research style statement against Fauci from a " White House Official " without anybody putting their name to the statement , Mc Enany did not answer . 
Pressed about putting a statement out from an anonymous source , something Trump has criticized in the past , Mc Enany again declined to answer , instead saying that Trump and Fauci have " always had a very good working relationship . " 
CNN has reported that the White House is making a concerted effort to discredit Fauci as he becomes increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country as coronavirus cases surge . 
The two men have not spoken in weeks .
