Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said there is no good answer when it comes to who should lead the way during the coronavirus pandemic . 
" That 's the $ 64,000 question that 's being debated right now in our response , " Fauci said , speaking to the Stanford School of Medicine . 
The Trump administration has repeatedly said the pandemic response should mostly be led by state and local officials . 
" Many of the states say ‘ give us the resources , we 'll take care of it . ’ 
Others say ‘ tell us what to do , and we 'll do it . ’ 
So we 're a big country . 
We have 50 states . 
We have 3,007 counties . 
So it really is an ongoing argument , " he said . 
Fauci added there are pros and cons of each approach . 
" And to be honest with you I do not have a good firm answer for you – except , you 've got to figure out on a case by case basis , what the best approach would be . "
