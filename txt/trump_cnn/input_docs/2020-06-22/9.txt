Democrats unveiled two pieces of legislation Monday they say will keep prices down for any taxpayer funded treatments and vaccines for Covid 19 . 
The federal government has granted billions to pharmaceutical companies for Covid related research without assurances that the drugs and vaccines that result from that research will be affordable and accessible to the American public , according to Rep . 
Jan Schakowsky ( D IL ) . 
The bills have bipartisan support from co sponsors Schakowsky and De Lauro as well as Reps . 
Lloyd Doggett ( D TX ) , Francis Rooney ( R FL ) and Peter De Fazio ( D OR ) . 
The bills intend to establish protections against drug price gouging for Covid 19 treatments and vaccines and excessive pricing of drugs for any disease that causes a public health emergency . 
The bills would also initiate major steps toward transparency , including a database of the funding and tax benefits that pharmaceutical companies have received . 
" Every other major country in the world negotiates lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry for all its residents , " De Fazio said . 
" Today â€™s legislation provides what the Trump administration has been unwilling to do by executive order , and that is meaningful protection for taxpayer dollars and insurance of patient access , " Doggett said .
