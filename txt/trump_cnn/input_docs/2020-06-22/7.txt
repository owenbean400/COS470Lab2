White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany said President Trump was speaking " in jest " when he said during his rally Saturday that he asked administration officials to slow down testing for Covid 19 in the US . 
Mc Enany was asked if the President actually made that request during a press briefing on Monday . 
" It was a comment that he made in jest , " Mc Enany added . 
" It ’s a comment that he made in passing , specifically with regard to the media coverage and pointing out the fact that the media never acknowledges that we have more cases because when you test more people you find more cases . " 
Asked if it was appropriate for Trump to joke about coronavirus when more than 100,000 Americans have died of the virus , Mc Enany denied it he was joking about the virus . 
" He was not joking about coronavirus . 
I just said he was joking about the media and their failure to understand the fact that when you test more , you also find more cases , " she said . 
Earlier Monday , Trump did not directly answer when asked by a Scripps reporter if he had requested to pare back testing . 
" If it did slow down , frankly , I think we ’re way ahead of ourselves if you want to know the truth , " Trump said . 
" We ’ve done too good a job . " 
CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins later asked Mc Enany about Trump ’s comments . 
Mc Enany responded that " the President instead used that opportunity to extoll the fact that we ’ve done 25 million tests . "
