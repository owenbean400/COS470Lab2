Two more clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine – the drug President Trump has touted as a " game changer " for Covid 19 – have been halted , bringing the total number to at least four . 
The National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases closed a hydroxychloroquine trial early after enrolling only 20 study subjects , according to a statement issued by the institute on Saturday . 
That trial originally intended to enroll about 2,000 Covid patients , according to clinicaltrials.gov . 
The NIAID statement said that they ended the trial because " the rate of participant enrollment has been inadequate for the trial to meet its objectives in a timely manner . " 
The Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development denied funding for a proposed hydroxychloroquine study for Covid patients , Dr . Salomeh Keyhani , a researcher at the San Francisco VA Health Care system , told CNN Thursday . 
That trial was supposed to enroll 300 patients , according to clinicaltrials.gov . 
On Saturday , the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute announced it had halted a trial of more than 500 study subjects . 
After more than 470 participants were enrolled , a data and safety monitoring board recommended that the NHLBI stop the study because , " while there was no harm , the study drug was very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID 19 . " 
Pharmaceutical giant Novartis announced Friday it would cancel its study due to challenges recruiting enough participants . 
" The recruitment challenge facing our HCQ trial has made it unlikely that the clinical team will be able to collect meaningful data in a reasonable timeframe to determine the effectiveness of HCQ in treating patients with COVID 19 , " according to the Novartis statement . 
Novartis aimed to enroll 444 participants , according to clinicaltrials.gov .
