On Tuesday , US President Donald Trump is heading to Arizona , where a spike in coronavirus cases has raised alarm and prompted new rules . 
Trump will speak to student supporters in Phoenix , where the city council and mayor have made face masks mandatory for people inside a building less than six feet away from others . 
Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told CNN that she hopes everyone attending the event will wear a mask -- including the President , who has previously claimed that masks do not do much in battling the virus , in direct contradiction to health experts . 
" It is not safe right now to have any large events , whether it be the President of the United States or large indoor sporting event , " Gallego said . 
Alarming spike : Arizona 's cases have nearly doubled in 14 days .

On Sunday , that figure reached 52,390 . 
There have been 1,339 coronavirus related deaths in the state since the start of the pandemic , according to Arizona 's health website .
