Chinese authorities on Monday warned against any actions or words that used the virus to " stigmatize " countries . 
This comes after US President Donald Trump called Covid 19 the " kung flu " during a campaign rally on Saturday . 
Trump has also previously called the virus " the Chinese plague " due to its origin in the Chinese city of Wuhan . 
Zhao added that the World Health Organization and the international community are " explicitly opposed to linking virus to any specific country or region . "
