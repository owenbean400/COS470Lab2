A new study suggests that mentions of President Trump played a big role in conversations involving Covid 19 misinformation in the first few months of the pandemic . 
The study , which has not been published in a peer reviewed journal , was released online by the Cornell Alliance for Science on Thursday . 
Co author Sarah Evanega said the peer review process was taking too long and the authors chose to post it without outside input , and to alert news media , for quicker release . 
The researchers — from Cornell University and Cision Global Insights in Michigan – analyzed media coverage of the Covid 19 pandemic across the Internet , podcasts , television , radio and other platforms between January 1 and May 26 . 
The alliance is funded in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . 
The analysis showed that English language media outlets published more than 1.1 million articles mentioning Covid 19 misinformation . 
Among those articles , the researchers found five different sub sections of topics that emerged within the overall Covid 19 misinformation conversations : Various misinformation sub topics such as " miracle cures " and conspiracies , which made up 46.6 % Mentions of Trump within broader misinformation conversations , which made up 37.9 % Coverage of the spread of misinformation or the " infodemic " itself , which made up 23.4 % fact checking , which made up 16.4 % Mentions of Trump only in the context of misinformation , which made up 10.3 % .

" Trump mentions comprised 37.9 % of the overall infodemic , well ahead of ' miracle cures ' , which comprised 26.4 % . "
