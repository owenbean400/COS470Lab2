The Data and Safety Monitoring Board , a group of experts in areas like statistics , ethics and vaccine development , views " unblinded " coronavirus vaccine data as it starts to come in , reports CNN ’s Dr . Sanjay Gupta . 
They can advise companies to apply for FDA review or might bring a trial to a halt , according to Gupta . 
Susan Ellenberg , a professor of biostatistics at UPenn ’s Perelman School of Medicine and a Covid 19 DSMB member , agreed to speak with CNN . 
" We have certainly never been in a situation where the national leadership has seemed to be so involved , directly involved , in these kinds of processes , " she told Dr . Gupta about President Trump ’s claims that the White House can overrule the FDA 's attempt to toughen guidelines for a coronavirus vaccine . 
Members of the board go through an extensive vetting process . 
" We want to know they 're fully independent , that they have no prior , you know , relationships with the company so that they 're not conflicted any way , " Dr . Eric Topol , a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research .
