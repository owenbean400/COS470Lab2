White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany was questioned Thursday on the President ’s decision to hold rallies in Wisconsin Saturday against recommendations from the White House coronavirus task force regarding social distancing . 
The Trump campaign told CNN Thursday that " everyone attending will receive a temperature check , be provided a mask they are encouraged to wear and have access to plenty of hand sanitizer . " 
The events come as Wisconsin " has continued to see a rapid worsening of the epidemic in the last week , " a September 27 task force report obtained by CNN said . 
The state has the third highest case rate in the country and has a test positivity rate between 8 % and 10 % , the seventh highest in the country . 
The task force recommended increased social distancing " to the maximal degree possible . " 
" During the intense period of viral surge , large numbers of acutely infected individuals caused exponential growth in infections . 
Although young adults are the most affected group currently , spread to other age groups is inevitable . 
To the maximal degree possible , increase social distancing mitigation measures until cases decline , including through supporting local authorities to pass and enforce mitigation measures , " the report said . 
The state also reported a grim new milestone Thursday — 27 people died of Covid 19 Wednesday , according to the state 's Covid 19 website . 
That is the highest death count on record for the state . 
Mc Enany attacked what she described as " two standards of health in this country : one for Trump supporters and one for everyone else , " railing against social justice protesters .
