The White House will formally reissue nationwide coronavirus guidelines today after President Trump — faced with dire models showing up to 200,000 American deaths and polls indicating support for social distancing and calamitous scenes at New York hospitals — determined another 30 days were necessary to avert disaster . 
Not all of Trump 's advisers support the decision , and some have privately questioned the models his health advisers used to convince him the distancing efforts were necessary , multiple people familiar with the matter said . 
Trump faced intense pressure from business leaders and some conservative economists to reopen some parts of the country before ultimately deciding against it . 
There has been internal debate over whether to ease the social distancing efforts . 
Some aides recommended the President only extend them another 15 days , but health advisers argued a month was necessary , people familiar with the discussions said . 
Trump told aides it would be better to ease the guidelines earlier than expected rather than have to extend them again . 
The guidelines are expected to last until April 30 .
