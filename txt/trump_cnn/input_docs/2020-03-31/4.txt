The Billie Jean King Tennis Center in Queens , New York , will soon house 350 hospital beds , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said . 
The makeshift hospital facility will take patients who have tested positive for Covid 19 but do not need ICU care from Elmhurst Hospital in order to relieve some of the pressure from the hospital , de Blasio said . 
It should be operational next week .
