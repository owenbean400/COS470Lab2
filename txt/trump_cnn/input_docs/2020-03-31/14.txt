We are reviewing these applications around the clock and more than 230 test developers have chosen this pathway to date . 
We 've also issued a policy offering flexible processes , meaning more than 110 labs and test developers across the country did not have to wait for the FDA to review their tests before patient testing -- they only needed to confirm the tests work . 
Quality of tests : And we 're not just focused on increasing the quantity of tests but ensuring the quality .
