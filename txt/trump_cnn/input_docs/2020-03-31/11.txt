President Trump discussed the need for Americans to wear masks to help stop the spread of coronavirus . 
Trump said that Americans " can wear scarves " in lieu of masks . 
Trump said he wants the masks being produced to go to hospitals that need them . 
" We want them to go to the hospitals . 
But one of the things that Dr . Fauci told me today is we do not want everybody competing with the hospitals where you really need them , " Trump added . 
Trump did say that it might not be a bad idea for Americans to use some sort of face cover , for at least a period of time . 
" So you can use scarves if you want , it can be something else , it does not have to be a mask , but it ’s not a bad idea at least for a period of time . 
I mean eventually you ’re not going to want to do that , you ’re not going to have to do that . 
It ’s going to be gone . 
It 's going to be gone , hopefully gone for a long time , " Trump said .
