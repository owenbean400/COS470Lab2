White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN that he would be open to the idea of a standalone bill that contains only funding for the US Postal Service ( USPS ) , despite President Trump â€™s calls in the last week for more USPS funding to arrive only as part of a broader stimulus package . 
Congressional Democrats rejected efforts by White House negotiators and Republicans to separately pass just individual parts of the stimulus proposal , like an enhanced unemployment benefit , as standalone bills during two weeks of negotiations that ended in a deadlock . 
Meadows argued Pelosi would potentially support a bill just focused on the Postal Service now because " her whole political dynamic has changed . " 
A spokesperson for Pelosi did not immediately respond to a request for comment . 
Meadows said members of Congress should return from their recess to take action on postal issues . 
Democrats proposed $ 25 billion in USPS funding in their version of the stimulus . 
Republicans floated $ 10 billion .
