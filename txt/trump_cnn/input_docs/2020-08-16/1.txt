White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN on Sunday that the US Postal Service will not dismantle any mail sorting machines between now and Election Day . 
The Service has come under criticism lately for dismantling some and planning on more . 
Chris Bentley , president of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union Local 297 , which covers Kansas and part of Missouri , previously told CNN that postal management had already taken out four machines in Kansas City , two machines in Springfield , Missouri , and one machine in Wichita , Kansas . 
Meadows told CNN that was not part of a new initiative but was part of a pre planned re allocation . 
Documents obtained by CNN last week indicated 671 machines used to organize letters or other pieces of mail are slated for " reduction " in dozens of cities this year . 
The Postal Service 's own document called the move a " reduction " of equipment . 
A letter sent Wednesday from the National Postal Mail Handlers Union to the Postal Service headquarters asked , " Why are these machines being removed ? " 
CNN â€™s Marshall Cohen , Curt Devine , Bob Ortega and Paul Murphy contributed to this story .
