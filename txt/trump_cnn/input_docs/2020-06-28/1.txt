As part of the BOK Center 's safety plan for the June 20 rally , arena management had purchased 12,000 do not sit stickers with the intention of keeping people apart by leaving open seats between attendees , according to the Post . 
Then on the day of the rally , when event staff had already placed the stickers on nearly every other chair in the 19,000 seat arena , the Trump campaign told event management to stop and began removing the stickers , according to a person familiar with the event who spoke to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters .
