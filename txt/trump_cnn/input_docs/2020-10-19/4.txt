President Trump ’s attacks on Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , wo not help the United States battle the coronavirus pandemic , said Dr . Ashish Jha , the dean of Brown University School of Public Health . 
It ’s " disturbing and " upsetting " to hear the President say such things , Jha told CNN ’s Jake Tapper . 
" We ’re in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century and Dr . Fauci is America 's most respected infectious disease expert for good reason , " Jha said . 
" I mean , right now we 're heading into a difficult fall and winter . 
Attacking your best experts is not what you want to be doing if you 're President of the United States . " 
It could also have dire health consequences , Jha said . 
" Dr . Fauci is not just somebody that the public respects . 
All of us in the medical field who study these things look up to him as the best there is , " Jha noted . 
" And so undermining him and undermining his message really makes it so much harder to control this virus , so much harder to control this pandemic . 
I think the President 's doing a great disservice to Dr . Fauci , but really to the country . " 
Trump called Fauci a " disaster " and referred to him and other health experts as " idiots " in a campaign phone call on Monday . 
Dr . Richard Besser , the former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper on " Full Circle " if political leaders are not working with scientists to pull the nation together in their coronavirus response , they 're likely going to fail . 
" Infectious agents do not care what political party you support . 
They do not care where you live . 
They will infect everybody and anybody , " he said .
