House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer says he is " hopeful " that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin can come to an agreement on the stimulus deal today , he told CNN ’s Poppy Harlow . 
Speaker Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for her and Secretary Mnuchin to reconcile significant policy disputes if they want to pass a relief bill before November 3 . 
A deal has evaded negotiators for months as the Trump administration and Pelosi have been hundreds of billions of dollars apart on topline numbers -- as well as what should be included . 
President Trump abruptly shut down stimulus negotiations earlier this month , only to completely reverse his position days later , sign off on a larger $ 1.8 trillion topline number and tweet " Go big or go home " on stimulus funding . 
But that ’s only one hurdle down , Hoyer says . 
" You can hear my voice , I 'm frustrated , others are frustrated , " he added .
