President Trump is expected to visit the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta this week , an administration official says . 
Administration officials weighed having Trump visit the CDC weeks ago , but he never followed through on the initial plans . 
It ’s unclear if Vice President Mike Pence , who was recently placed in charge of the administration ’s response , will join him on the trip . 
Politico first reported Trump would be making the trip . 
Some context : The visit comes as Trump has fumed in recent days at Dr . Nancy Messonnier , the director of the CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , who recently said , " It 's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen . " 
Trump thought officials like Messonnier were causing unnecessary alarm .
