Some 71 % of Americans say they will " definitely or probably " get a Covid 19 vaccine , according to a survey out Tuesday from the Kaiser Family Foundation . 
But Black Americans , people living in rural areas and Republicans are more hesitant about getting the shots . 
A third of those surveyed said they want to get a vaccine " as soon as possible , " while 39 % said they would " wait and see " how initial vaccination goes before getting a vaccine themselves . 
The non profit health research group polled 1,676 adults for the survey , which the group is launching as the Covid 19 Vaccine Monitor and plans to update regularly . 
About 15 % of respondents said they would " definitely not " get a Covid 19 vaccine . 
Some 9 % of those surveyed , mostly essential workers , reported they would get a vaccine only if it were required by work , school , or other parts of their lives . 
The survey also looked at motivations behind vaccine hesitancy , and found that the groups that are the most vaccine hesitant are Republicans , 30 to 39 year olds , rural Americans , and Black Americans . 
For Republicans , 57 % of those surveyed chose " the risks of Covid 19 are being exaggerated " as a major reason they definitely or probably would not get a vaccine . 
" Many Americans who are hesitant are simply reserving judgment before they are ready to get vaccinated . 
However , nearly one in four Republicans do not want to get vaccinated because they do not believe COVID poses a serious threat , " said Mollyann Brodie , executive vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation . 
" It will be a real challenge to undo COVID denialism among this slice of President Trump â€™s political base . "
