In agreement with Dr . Anthony Fauci ’s comments , Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , says President elect Joe Biden should be vaccinated . 
This would also show the public that they trust the vaccine and lead by example , he added . 
Slaoui also said the administration has a plan to push out public messaging on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine so that the American people trust the vaccine . 
President Trump ’s role in driving that message is " very important , " he added . 
" There 's a whole fringe of the population that listen to the President very carefully , and therefore , he has an important role . 
I know he ’s been very supportive of the vaccine development , so I hope he will be of course as supportive of its usage . "
