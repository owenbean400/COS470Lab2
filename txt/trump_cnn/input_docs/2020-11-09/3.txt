Hydroxychloroquine does not work on patients hospitalized with Covid 19 , according to research published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) . 
It ’s the latest of several studies to find the antimalarial does not work against the coronavirus . 
The randomized trial involved 479 Covid 19 patients at 34 US hospitals with respiratory illness . 
Some received hydroxychloroquine and some received a placebo . 
The results found strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine is " not beneficial " for adults hospitalized with Covid 19 , and " no significant difference between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups . " 
The trial had several limitations , including that it only included hospitalized adults and only one dosage level of hydroxychloroquine . 
It did not consider whether patients used other therapies , such as azithromycin , zinc or remdesivir . 
In a corresponding JAMA editorial , Dr . Michael Saag , a researcher with the Department of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , noted President Donald Trump ’s early support of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid 19 treatment , and wrote that politicization was an important factor in promoting use of the drug . 
The US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine on March 28 after a big push from Trump and his administration , but revoked it on June 15 .
