Florida has obtained more remdesivir and added self swab tests as Covid 19 cases continue to climb in the state , Gov . 
Ron De Santis announced during a briefing in St . Augustine on Saturday . 
De Santis said that 300,000 more vials of remdesivir will be arriving at Florida hospitals , directly from distributors in 48 to 72 hours . 
The shipment of the drug was secured with help from Vice President Mike Pence and the Trump administration , according to De Santis . 
Self swab tests — which have a 24 to 48 hour turnaround time — were also added to some test sites Friday , the governor added . 
Some private lab results now reflect tests taken " seven to 14 days ago , " which is not ideal for contact tracing , De Santis said .
