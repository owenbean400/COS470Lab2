El Salvador President Nayib Bukele says he 's taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid 19 . 
Remember : Hydroxchloroquine is an anti malarial drug that medical experts have said is an unproven and possibly harmful therapy to ward off the coronavirus . 
US President Donald Trump has also claimed he is using the drug . 
Bukele touted his use of the drug during a news conference with the US Ambassador to El Salvador , Ronald Johnson , about the donation the US had made of 250 ventilators to the Central American country . 
" Sometimes what 's recommended to the people is something different than what 's recommended to the leaders , because I have been recommended to use hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis and the probability of this harming you is very low , " Bukele said as he displayed a bottle of what is assumed to be hydroxychloroquine . 
Bukele did not say how much he was taking or if the drug was prescribed by a doctor . 
The leader added that at the recommendation of the World Health Organization , the drug was no longer part of the country 's coronavirus treatment protocol , but it would remain available for " those who wish to use it as prophylaxis " or by a doctor 's prescription . 
The World Health Organization announced Monday that it has temporarily halted studying hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid 19 treatment in its Solidarity Trial due to safety concerns .
