Former US President Barack Obama delivered scathing criticism of how the coronavirus pandemic has been handled by American leaders during a second commencement address on Saturday . 
Obama did not name his successor , President Donald Trump . 
But his target was clear as he characterized the US response to the crisis as woefully haphazard . 
Obama was speaking in a primetime event called " Graduate Together : America Honors the High School Class of 2020 , " which was broadcast on many networks , including CNN . 
In remarks made earlier to graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities Saturday , Obama again did not name Trump . 
But his rebuke of how the current President has handled the worst public health crisis in a general was plain . 
Obama said he hopes the graduates decide to ground themselves with " values that last . 
Like honestly , hard work , responsibility , fairness , generosity , and respect for others . "
