Sarah Thebarge , a 41 year old physician assistant living in San Francisco , takes a pill every day to treat her lupus , a chronic condition that causes unbearable joint pain , fatigue and fainting spells . 
The medicine she takes is hydroxychloroquine or HCQ . 
But in March , HCQ , which is also used to treat malaria , suddenly became harder to get after US President Donald Trump touted the drug as a possible treatment for Covid 19 . 
As people started hoarding it , India -- which reportedly makes 70 % of the world 's supply of HCQ -- quickly halted exports to secure its own supplies . 
" When the hoarding started , my 30 day supply was in back order , " said Thebarge . 
" The scenario really scared me , what would happen to me if I could not get HCQ ? " 
The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has not approved HCQ as the treatment for Covid 19 , but the episode showed how dependent the US is on India for drugs -- namely generic drugs , which are copies of brand name pharmaceuticals that have the same effects but cost less . 
In the US , 90 % of all prescriptions are filled by generic drugs and , one in every three pills consumed is produced by an Indian generics manufacturer , according to an April 2020 study by the Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ) and KPMG . 
While the US seems to hold sway with its ally India in obtaining the finished product , there 's a bigger issue earlier in the supply chain . 
India gets around 68 % of its raw materials -- known as active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ) -- from China . 
Any disruption in that supply chain can create a major problem , especially during a pandemic .
