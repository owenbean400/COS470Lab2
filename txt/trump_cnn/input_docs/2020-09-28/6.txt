The federal style of government in the US can act against the country ’s best interest in a pandemic , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday . 
States and territories cannot always go their own way , Fauci told CNN ’s Brian Stelter . 
" The federalist approach where you have a central government but you also have the 50 states and other territories that have the capability and are encouraged even to act independently on our own , " Fauci said . 
" That works well a lot of times . 
But when you have an epidemic that grips the entire country , a pandemic where one part of the country influences another part of the country , it ’s important to do things in a relatively uniform way while respecting the individual differences in states , in cities and in counties , " added Fauci , who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force . 
The White House has declined to set federal policies on any public health strategies for fighting the pandemic , from mandating mask use to opening high risk businesses including bars and restaurants . 
The Trump administration has instead stressed the responsibility of states to control the spread of the virus .
