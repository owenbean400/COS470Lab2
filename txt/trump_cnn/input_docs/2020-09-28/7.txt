President Trump 's plan to disperse 150 million rapid coronavirus tests is a step in the right direction , but too small and too late , Dr . William Haseltine , chair and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International , told CNN anchor Pamela Brown today . 
Haseltine went on to call the step " modestly helpful , " but said that in order for the federal government to slow the spread of the virus , it would need to distribute from 10 to 20 times that number of rapid tests . 
Trump formally announced his plan on Monday to distribute 150 million Abbott point of care tests in the coming week , a plan first promoted by the White House in August . 
Announcing the distribution plan in the White House Rose Garden , Trump claimed the testing effort would " allow every state on a very regular basis test every teacher who needs it . " 
" I 'm pleased to report we 're announcing our plan to distribute 150 million Abbott point of care tests in the coming weeks , " Trump said in the Rose Garden on Monday .
