Twitter said on Wednesday it had restricted US President Donald Trump 's campaign from tweeting after its account shared a video containing false claims about the coronavirus . 
The tweet , a video of Trump 's interview with Fox News in which he said children are " almost immune " to the virus , " is in violation of the Twitter Rules on Covid 19 misinformation , " a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement . 
" The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again . " 
The account appeared to have the ability to tweet following Twitter 's statement , suggesting the campaign had complied with the order and removed the video . 
Just hours before , Facebook removed a post from Trump 's main page featuring the same interview for similar reasons . 
Campaign 's response : Courtney Parella , a spokesperson for the Trump campaign , said the President was " stating a fact that children are less susceptible to the coronavirus , " echoing the statement she shared after Facebook 's removal . 
Parella accused Silicon Valley of being biased against the President and said " social media companies are not the arbiters of truth . " 
Last week , Twitter imposed a similar restriction on the account of the President 's son , Donald Trump Jr . , after he posted a video featuring a doctor making false claims about coronavirus cures and stating that people " do not need masks " to prevent the virus from spreading . 
Twitter said at the time that some of the account 's functionality , including the ability to tweet , would be restricted for 12 hours .
