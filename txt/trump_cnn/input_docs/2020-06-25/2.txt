CNN reported last night that multiple Secret Service officers were also instructed to self quarantine after two of their colleagues who were on site for the rally tested positive . 
Several of the campaign ’s surrogates who traveled to Tulsa have also undergone coronavirus testing out of an abundance of caution , two sources said .
