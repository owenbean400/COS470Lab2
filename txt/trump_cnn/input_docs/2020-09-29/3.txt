The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was pushed to play down the risks of the coronavirus pandemic in reopening schools , Olivia Troye , a former staff member for Vice President Mike Pence , told CNN . 
Troye said an earlier New York Times story about the pressure was accurate , and described the situation within the White House Coronavirus Task Force as a " nightmare . " 
Troye confirmed an incident in June in which she and those junior staffers , pushed by Pence ’s chief of staff Marc Short , tried to circumvent the CDC in finding data on Covid 19 that would better support President Donald Trump ’s stance that schools should reopen . 
" I think it put these task force members and doctors in a very challenging position , " Troye said . 
" It was what was going on behind the scenes . "
