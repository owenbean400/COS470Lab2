As federal agencies continue to investigate possible treatment options for the novel coronavirus , pharmaceutical company Bayer announced on Thursday that it is donating 3 million tablets of its antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate to the US government . 
Sharing details first with CNN , Bayer said in a statement that chloroquine phosphate , sold under the name Resochin , originally has been indicated for the prevention and treatment of malaria , but also appears to have " broad spectrum antiviral properties " and effects on the body ’s immune response . 
" New data from initial preclinical and evolving clinical research conducted in China , while limited , shows potential for the use of Resochin in treating patients with COVID 19 infection , " the statement said . 
Earlier Thursday : President Trump said the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine would be available with a prescription to treat the novel coronavirus . 
Early evidence from human cells suggests that chloroquine — which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases — may have some activity against the novel coronavirus . 
Doctors in China , the US and other countries have used the drug experimentally in COVID 19 patients , but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it 's effective in humans .
