Some in the nursing industry were left " confused " after President Trump appeared to walk back his decision to use the Defense Production Act to combat medical equipment shortages on Wednesday . 
Hours after a meeting with industry representatives in which he spoke about " scaling up " supplies , Trump said on Twitter that he had only signed the act " should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future . " 
" It was so disassociated from what he said this morning at the press conference and what he said to us , " said Dr . David Benton , CEO of the National Council of State Boards of Nursing , who was at the White House meeting . 
Benton said representatives " described to the President how critical [ ventilators ] are " and expressed " anxiety " about the availability of protective equipment including masks and gowns . 
The White House said more equipment was coming , just not under the Defense Production Act . 
A senior administration official said that the Department of Health and Human Services was working with states and the private sector to facilitate distribution as needed . 
By the numbers : The Department of Homeland Security estimates that should the virus become " very severe , " 38 million people will need medical care and 9.6 million will need hospitalization . 
Of those , an estimated 2.9 million people will need to be admitted to intensive care units , overwhelming current capacity .
