Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell vowed to move a massive $ 1 trillion economic stimulus bill at " warp " speed . 
But on Capitol Hill , warp speed is not that simple and could mean more than a week before relief comes . 
There are many legislative hurdles and ample policy differences that lawmakers still have to iron out . 
That ’s left Republican and Democratic leaders uncertain how quickly a bill can pass Congress , meaning getting a final measure to President Trump ’s desk next week is currently the most optimistic assessment , at best . 
That means industries and workers now under siege from the damaging economic crisis will be forced to wait for the legislative sausage making to work its course . 
And once the bill is eventually passed , it will take time to get implemented , including proposed payments to workers who have been displaced because of the unprecedented impact of the novel coronavirus . 
While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked congressional leaders for a bill to be completed by Monday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democratic lawmakers that is an unrealistic timeframe , according to a source familiar with her remarks . 
Pelosi pointed to the last round of talks with the Trump administration that continued to drag on over the emergency relief package that was just signed into law , the source said . 
Republicans in the Senate seem to share a similar assessment .
