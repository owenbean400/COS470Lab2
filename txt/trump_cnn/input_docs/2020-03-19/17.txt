President Trump said the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine would soon be made available with a prescription to treat the novel coronavirus . 
Early evidence from human cells suggests that chloroquine — which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases — may have some activity against the novel coronavirus . 
Doctors in China , the US and other countries have used the drug experimentally in COVID 19 patients , but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it 's effective in humans . 
The drug , generally considered to be safe for most patients , can have side effects including seizures , nausea , vomiting , deafness , vision changes and low blood pressure . 
Some more context : When asked about chloroquine last month , Dr . Janet Diaz of the World Health Organization said " there is no proof that that is an effective treatment at this time . 
We recommend that therapeutics be tested under ethically approved clinical trials to show efficacy and safety . " 
At the time , Diaz said the drugs that were being prioritized by WHO 's research and development efforts were antivirals . 
Trump also mentioned an antiviral drug , remdesivir , which is the focus of clinical trials in China and the US . 
Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral that appears to work against a range of very different virus families , including coronaviruses and Ebola . 
The drug is already being tested at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in adults diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease , according to the National Institutes of Health .
