The Energy Department promised Thursday to support US oil producers facing " potentially catastrophic losses " by quickly purchasing 30 million barrels of crude . 
Those barrels , purchased at dirt cheap prices , will be used to start filling up America 's emergency oil stockpile , known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , or SPR . 
The initial purchase will be focused on small and midsize US oil producers , the group most at risk from the oil crash to $ 20 a barrel . 
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he will recommend to President Trump that he request funding from Congress to buy even more crude â€” enough to fill up the SPR . 
Mnuchin said the oil market has " nothing to do with the coronavirus , other than there 's just a lot less demand . " 
That 's not exactly right : The demand destruction , caused by mass cancellations of flights and widespread factory shutdowns , is a major driver of the oil crash . 
The other huge problem : Saudi Arabia and Russia are flooding the market with too much supply in a bid to crowd out high cost US producers .
