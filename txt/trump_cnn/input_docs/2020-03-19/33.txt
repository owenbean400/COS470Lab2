California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom described in letter to President Trump on Thursday the impact coronavirus will have on the state and its residents . 
He asked that the US Navy â€™s Mercy Hospital Ship be stationed at the port of Los Angeles . 
Defense officials tell CNN the ship will head to the Seattle area in the next five to 10 days . 
The final destination could always change depending on civilian needs , an official cautioned . 
Newsom said the hospital ship " will help decompress the health care system to allow the Los Angeles region to ensure that it has the ability to address critical acute care needs . "
