This version of Donald Trump will save lives . 
The President offered Americans something they have rarely seen from him in his latest and most somber press conference yet on the coronavirus pandemic on Monday . 
He dispensed unimpeachable information based on fact . 
He called for national unity and seemed like he meant to help forge it . 
And he ditched his normal habit of hyping the best possible outcome to a situation with improbable superlatives -- instead communicating the gravity of a fast worsening crisis . 
" It 's bad . 
It 's bad , " Trump said as he unveiled a 15 day plan to try to flatten the curve of new infections to alleviate a feared surge of sick patients that could overwhelm the health system . 
" Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus , " Trump said , summoning national resolve as he plunges deeper into a crisis that will now define his term and possibly his reelection hopes .

The President 's pivot to seriousness contrasted sharply with some of his previous commentary on the pandemic , which he has compared to the flu and predicted could just go away , and came after he claimed he had " shut it down " and had the disease under control .
