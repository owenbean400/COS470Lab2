Google will delay the rollout of an informational coronavirus website until later this week , instead of a Monday launch date , the company said . 
What the website will not have : Despite the reference to screening and testing , Google still does not appear to be developing a nationwide tool to directly survey patients for their symptoms and guide them to testing sites , as the Trump administration has claimed in recent days . 
What it will have : The website is expected to display information about how Americans can access screening , and list other information about local testing sites . 
It will also include a link to the CDC 's own screening tool , which is under development . 
Why the rollout is delayed : Google says it 's still waiting on more information about local testing sites . 
Do not get confused : Google 's sister company Verily also just launched a website that guides Californian users to testing locations in the San Francisco Bay Area . 
Verily has said it hopes to expand its tool , but has not issued a timeframe for its deployment . 
The two websites were the subject of great confusion after President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence announced that Google is working on a tool that will direct Americans to local testing sites . 
But Google â€™s announcement , including its remarks Monday evening , stop short of meeting that description .
