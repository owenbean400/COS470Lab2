Steve Mnuchin about the logistics of an economic stimulus idea that could give $ 1,000 checks to Americans , which is gaining some bipartisan support .

" I think it ’s clear we do not need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks . 
But we like — that ’s one of the ideas we like . 
We ’re going to preview that today and then we ’ll be talking about details afterwards , " Mnuchin said . 
Trump chimed in , saying , " I think we ’re going to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible . 
That may not be an accurate way of doing it because obviously some people should not be getting checks for $ 1000 .
