House Oversight Chairwoman Rep . 
Carolyn Maloney introduced a new bill on Wednesday aimed at reversing organizational and structural changes undertaken at the US Postal Service by the new Postmaster General Louis De Joy , a Republican donor and ally to the President . 
" Our Postal Service should not become an instrument of partisan politics , but instead must be protected as a neutral , independent entity that focuses on one thing and one thing onlyâ€”delivering the mail , " Maloney said in a press release announcing the " Delivering for America Act . " 
What 's in the bill : The proposed bill prohibits USPS from implementing any operational changes it had in place as of the beginning of this calendar year until the end of the coronavirus pandemic , a timeframe that would also postpone the changes beyond the November election . 
Some more context : USPS customers have seen a slowing of mail delivery in some place under De Joy and under his leadership the agency has recently implemented new efforts that some workers blame for delays across the country , which has prompted fears that ballots may not reach election offices in time come November . 
De Joy told the Postal Service Board of Governors last week that USPS is not " slowing down " election related mail or any other mail and said the agency will be undergoing " organizational realignment . " 
President Trump has often criticized USPS as a money losing venture .
