US President Donald Trump cited misleading statistics about coronavirus cases in Europe during a news briefing Tuesday , claiming inaccurately that the United States is currently handling the pandemic better than other countries . 
It â€™s true that cases are rapidly rising in Europe , but the numbers are nowhere near the level of infection in the United States . 
The US added 49,536 new cases on Monday , a day that consistently sees lower numbers . 
The US is averaging 54,409 new cases over the past seven days , which is up slightly from the previous few days . 
However , the percentage change from the prior week in cases is down 10 % , not 20 % as the President claimed . 
This is also slightly lower than last week , when the US dipped down 16 % compared to the prior week in this metric , according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University .
