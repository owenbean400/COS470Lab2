Attacking teachers unions and Democrats , President Trump said he wants to see federal money for schools " follow the student " if public schools do not reopen in the fall . 
" And that 's something that we want to do , we ’re having a hard time with the Democrats , they want the money to follow the union , " Trump claimed . 
" To be honest , it 's very simple . 
Give it to the union . 
But the fact is , give it to dues because the union people are fantastic , people in there . 
But the people that run the union , it 's disgraceful and the dues and that they charge , the teachers and that 's what it 's all about . " 
" So I would like – anyway , " he continued , " I would like the money to follow the student , and this way you can make your own choice . 
If the school is closed , you know , why are we paying if a school is closed , why are we paying to school ? 
I 'd rather give it to the student , the parents , and you do your own thing , and to me it makes a lot of sense . " 
Some background : The Trump administration has been pushing school choice for years , but has renewed the push in light of the pandemic . 
Education Secretary Betsy De Vos has also argued that if parents take their children out of public schools , " the tax dollars meant to support their education should go with them . " 
De Vos has said she ’s called for school choice for more than three decades , and has added that the pandemic " really welcomes it . " 
" It frankly demands it , " De Vos said at a similar forum in July . 
" Students need it , families are demanding it , and teachers need it . "
