The pharmaceutical company Inovio plans to begin a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of its Covid 19 vaccine candidate this month , according to company president and CEO Dr . Joseph Kim . 
How it works : Inovio 's vaccine technology works by delivering particles of DNA directly into cells , triggering an immune response to the novel coronavirus inside the cells . 
The Phase 2/3 clinical trial was first announced in August on an earnings call . 
Inovio plans to enroll 6,000 to 10,000 volunteers in the study . 
That ’s less than the 30,000 volunteers who are being enrolled in clinical trials for several other Covid 19 vaccine candidates . 
Kim said the trial will be smaller than others because they ’ll be targeting high risk people , such as factory workers . 
In August , Inovio shared results of small a Phase 1 clinical trial involving 40 volunteers . 
Side effects were mild , and the vaccine showed evidence of neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses . 
The data has not yet been published in a peer reviewed medical journal . 
Inovio ’s Covid 19 vaccine is being funded , in part , by the US Department of Defense , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , and The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations . 
The company has not received funding from Operation Warp Speed , the Trump administration ’s initiative to fast track the development and delivery of a Covid 19 vaccine . 
Three Phase 3 trials have already started in the US . 
Two other companies are also scheduled to begin Phase 3 trials this month , according to Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed . 
Sanofi and Glaxo Smith Kline expect to start a Phase 3 trial in the US by the end of the year .
