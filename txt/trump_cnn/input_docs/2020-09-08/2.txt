Another federal official is making it clear that despite US President Donald Trump 's predictions , there 's hardly any chance a vaccine will be available to Americans by Election Day . 
Trump , however , has projected optimism for a quicker timeline . 
" ( It 's ) going to be done in a very short period of time -- could even have it during the month of October , " the President said at a press briefing Monday . 
" We 'll have the vaccine soon , maybe before a special date . 
You know what date I 'm talking about . " 
On August 6 , Trump said he was " optimistic " a vaccine would be ready by around November 3 . 
" I believe we 'll have the vaccine before the end of the year , certainly , but around that date , yes . 
I think so , " Trump said . 
And at a rally last week , he said , " It will be delivered before the end of the year , in my opinion , before the end of the year , but it really might even be delivered before the end of October . " 
The federal official is not the first to cast skepticism on Trump 's forecast . 
It 's " extremely unlikely , but not impossible " that a Covid 19 vaccine could be authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration before the end of October , Moncef Slaoui , the chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , told NPR last week . 
Dr . Larry Corey , who 's leading a group set up by the National Institutes of Health to work on coronavirus vaccines , also said he does not think there will be a vaccine available by Election Day . 
" I would agree with Dr . Slaoui . 
The chances are very low , very remote , " said Corey , who leads the COVID 19 Prevention Network .
