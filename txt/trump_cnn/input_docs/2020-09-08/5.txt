House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Senate GOP leaders for their plan to move later this week on a scaled down coronavirus stimulus package . 
" What they have is so meager that it insults the intelligence of the American people , " Pelosi said Tuesday during an interview with Bloomberg TV . 
What is this about : Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell is proposing a $ 500 billion measure , about half the size of Republicans ’ initial offer . 
The bill is not expected to receive the 60 votes needed to pass , as Democrats are likely to oppose it . 
Democratic leaders have called instead for a $ 2 trillion relief package . 
Pelosi alleged the bill is an attempt to give vulnerable GOP senators some political cover . 
" It ’s only to check the box so some of his endangered Republican senators can go home and say , ‘ Well , see I tried . ’ 
But it is not trying . 
It ’s not even an attempt to do the right thing , and Mitch Mc Connell knows that because he has to satisfy those Republicans in his caucus who do not want to spend one more dollar , " said Pelosi . 
" Get serious . 
Get real , Mitch Mc Connell , " she added . 
She said Republicans should negotiate among themselves to come to some consensus on how to move forward , noting that the new GOP plan differs from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ’s proposal to Democratic leaders . 
" They are in disarray , " Pelosi said . 
She also claimed Republicans " do not believe in science , and they do not believe in governance . " 
But Pelosi projected confidence on a separate front that Republicans and Democrats will move to keep the government funded ahead of a Sept . 30 deadline . 
" We ’ll come to agreement on that , I feel quite certain , " she said . 
She said she believes it would be hard for President Trump to veto a clean continuing resolution . 
" It ’s not in anybody ’s interest for the government to be shut down . 
It is to be avoided at all costs , " Pelosi said .
