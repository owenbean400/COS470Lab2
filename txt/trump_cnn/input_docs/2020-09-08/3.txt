Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris told CNN affiliate WISN that she would trust a vaccine under President Trump , if " the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it , " dropping the clause she has previously used that she would not trust a vaccine under Trump . 
Asked by WISN she would trust a vaccine under Trump , Harris first answered , " I pray we have a vaccine as quickly as possible that is approved by the scientists and the public health professionals . " 
Pressed again , she said this : On Sunday , Harris would not clearly answer CNN â€™s Dana Bash whether she would in fact take a vaccine if produced before Election Day . 
Harris instead said she would not trust Trump as a credible source of information on a vaccine . 
" I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he 's talking about , " Harris said Sunday . 
" I will not take his word for it . 
He wants us to inject bleach . 
No , I will not take his word . " 
Those comments drew criticism from both the GOP and President Trump , who called on her to apologize . 
Yesterday , her running mate Joe Biden , when asked a similar question said if he could get a vaccine , he 'd take it tomorrow , even if it cost him the election .
