In his Monday afternoon news conference , US President Donald Trump got into an exchange with Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason after Mason would not remove his face mask at the request of the President . 
Mason replied that he would just speak louder to counter the effects of the mask . 
Trump was not satisfied with this response , telling the reporter his voice was " very muffled " with the face covering , " so if you would take it off , it would be a lot easier . " 
Mason raised his voice and repeated his offer to speak louder , asking " is that better ? " 
The President sighed saying , " it 's better . 
Yeah , it 's better . " 
Later in the news conference , Trump remarked that one reporter who did remove his mask sounded " so clear . 
As opposed to everybody else , where they refuse . " 
This is not the first time that the President has requested a reporter take off his or her mask so that he could hear a question more clearly , but his disappointment with Mason 's response was notable .
