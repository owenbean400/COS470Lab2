Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Tuesday he is cautiously optimistic that a vaccine will be proven safe and effective by the end of the year . 
But he said that â€™s unlikely to happen by Election Day . 
President Trump has said he thinks a Covid 19 vaccine could be ready by Election Day , Nov . 3 , but Fauci said this is unlikely . 
" It 's unlikely that we 'll have a definitive answer at that time , " he added . 
" More likely by the end of the year . " 
There are currently three vaccine candidates in large scale , Phase Three clinical trials in the US . 
" You have a lot of candidates in play , which really is the reason why we 're optimistic that we will be successful with one or more , and that will likely start taking place by the end of the calendar year 2020 , " said Fauci .
