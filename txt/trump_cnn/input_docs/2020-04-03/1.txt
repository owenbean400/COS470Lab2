Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , joined CNN 's town hall Thursday to discuss the novel coronavirus pandemic . 
Fauci said he believes that there should be a federally mandated stay at home order , something President Donald Trump has been loathe to do . 
Trump said Wednesday that he does not plan to issue such an order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases . 
The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states depending on how bad individual states situations might be . 
" You have to look -- you have to give a little flexibility . 
If you have a state in the Midwest , or if Alaska for example does not have a problem , it 's awfully tough to say close it down . 
We have to have a little bit of flexibility , " Trump said .
