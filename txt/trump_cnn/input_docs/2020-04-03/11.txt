Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , the technical lead for the World Health Organization 's Covid 19 response , said people who are sick and their caretakers should wear face masks — but stressed that N95 masks need to be reserved for health care workers . 
" What we recommend is that people who are sick wear masks — medical masks , not N95 masks with respirators . 
Those must be reserved for our frontline workers who are caring for patients , " she said at a CNN town hall on coronavirus last night . 
" We also need people who are caring for those who are sick to be wearing the masks , " she added . 
She said right now , it 's crucial that personal protective equipment in short supply be reserved for medical workers . 
Some background : The WHO has been one of the strongest holdouts when it comes to recommending the widespread use of masks . 
US health officials recommended the same — but they may be shifting course . 
On Monday , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Robert Redfield , told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and may recommend general mask use to guard against community infection . 
Trump said the US plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days . 
When asked about President Trump 's suggestion that people use facial coverings like scarves , Van Kerkhove said the WHO is investigating . 
" We are constantly looking at evidence , all the time , for the use of masks for anything that is related to this and related to health issues . 
We are talking with scientists around the world , including US CDC scientists , " she said .
