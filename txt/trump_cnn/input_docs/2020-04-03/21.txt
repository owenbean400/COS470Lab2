New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called upon President Trump during a Friday press conference to start a " national enlistment effort " for medical personnel across the country and to have the US military coordinate that effort . 
De Blasio called for an effort " to recruit doctors , nurses , and medical professionals from all over the country , send them rapidly where they 're needed most and then move them rapidly to the next biggest problem , the next biggest challenge . 
And what we will do , and I know every other city and state will do the same , is we will then offer our personnel to go to the next front to help as well . " 
De Blasio said the US military could organize the effort because they have " the ability to put together a national structure to mobilize these medical personnel and ensure they get where they need to go rapidly and to make sure the priorities are right . " 
De Blasio said : " It 's time for the commander in chief to give the order . 
If we ’re fighting a war , let ’s act like we ’re fighting a war . 
Right now , there ’s a peacetime approach in Washington and that wo not cut it . "
