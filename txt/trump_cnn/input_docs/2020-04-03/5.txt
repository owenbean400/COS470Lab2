One of America 's leading infectious disease experts has called for a federally mandated stay at home order . 
Speaking at a CNN town hall on Thursday , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said he believed the order should be put in place , something President Donald Trump has been loathe to do . 
Trump said Wednesday that he does not plan to issue such an order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases . 
The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states depending on how bad individual states situations might be .
