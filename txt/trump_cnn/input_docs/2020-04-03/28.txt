President Trump said Friday that he could not assure the state of New York will have enough ventilators to deal with coronavirus patients , after New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the state is days away from running out of the lifesaving machines . 
Asked during a White House press briefing whether he could assure that the state would have enough ventilators , Trump said , " No , they should have had more ventilators at the time . " 
Trump added that the White House thinks Cuomo is " well served with ventilators . 
We ’re going to find out , but we have other states to take care of . " 
" I wish they did the original orders ( for ventilators ) three years ago . They would have had all the ventilators they needed , " Trump continued , before adding , " Although , even then they would not . " 
Some context : On Monday , Trump told reporters that he thinks every American who may need a ventilator in the next few weeks will have access to one . 
" I do think so , yes , " Trump told a reporter in the White House Rose Garden . 
" I think we ’re going to be in very good shape . "
