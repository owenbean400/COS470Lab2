President Trump is being urged to consider calling for nationwide stay at home recommendations , something he has so far refused to do , a source close to the White House Coronavirus Task Force says tells CNN . 
Among the officials nudging the President to embrace such a move is Dr . Anthony Fauci , the source said . 
On Thursday night during CNN 's Town Hall on the coronavirus pandemic , Fauci said it 's time for every state in the country to have stay at home orders . 
" If you look at what 's going on in this country , I just do not understand why we 're not doing that . 
We really should be , " Fauci said . 
Separately , a White House official tells CNN that the task force is looking to issue mask guidelines at Friday 's White House briefing . 
The official said it 's possible the mask guidelines could slide until Saturday , but the briefing is expected to delve into masks today . 
President Trump , Vice President Pence , Dr . Fauci , and Dr . Deborah Birx are all expected to attend the official said .
