Despite recent support from members of his coronavirus task force for a nationwide stay at home order , President Trump said Friday he 'd " leave it up to the governors . " 
As justification for this decision , Trump claimed the states currently without stay at home orders are " not in jeopardy . " 
Facts First : It 's not true that the eight states without stay at home orders at the time of the President 's remarks are " not in jeopardy " or at risk from the coronavirus . 
Though they are not current " hot spots of the virus , " all of them are dealing with at least 100 reported cases and 1/4 of them have over 1,000 cases . 
Missouri , South Carolina , Utah , Iowa , Arkansas , Nebraska , South Dakota , North Dakota and Wyoming did not have statewide stay at home orders in place as of Friday evening . 
Although South Dakota , North Dakota and Wyoming are among the five states with the least amount of cases in the US , South Carolina and Utah have 1,554 and 1,095 cases respectively . 
Missouri â€™s stay at home order goes into effect Monday . 
The state had at least 1,864 cases before Gov . 
Mike Parson issued the order Friday evening .
