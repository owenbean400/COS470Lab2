When asked by CNN â€™s Jim Acosta about the level of preparedness for a pandemic like Covid 19 , President Trump said while he knew pandemics were " one of the worst things that could happen ... most people thought it would not and most people did not understand the severity of it . " 
Trump was responding to Acosta 's question about Department of Health and Human Services Sec . 
Alex Azar saying in April 2019 that a " pandemic flu " is what kept him up most at night . 
Trump said he did not think Azar " was speaking about a specific pandemic , " adding , " I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen . " 
" Most people thought it would not and most people did not understand the severity of it , " Trump said . 
" I assume he was talking about the possibility . " 
When pressed by Acosta on why the administration does not have enough PPE supplies , Trump blamed it on previous administration , and once again repeated the false claim that the Obama administration left the military with no ammunition .
