House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that Democrats could put on hold a host of their infrastructure priorities and instead advance a new stimulus measure that mirrors the historic $ 2.2 trillion stimulus package President Trump signed into law last week . 
She added : " It is imperative that we go bigger and further assisting small business , to go longer in unemployment benefits and provide additional resources to process UI claims and to give families additional direct payments . 
We must also provide the desperately needed resources for our hospitals , community health centers , health systems and health workers on the frontlines of this crisis . 
We cannot succeed in defeating this virus unless we more strongly support state and local governments with significantly more resources . " 
Earlier on Friday : Pelosi indicated the Democrats â€™ infrastructure priorities , which they have advocated for as part of another legislative response to the pandemic , could be pushed off for a later bill .
