Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a blunt warning to the Trump administration on Friday saying that forbidding 3M from shipping crucial supplies of N95 masks to Canada " could hurt Americans as much as anybody else . " 
" We â€™ve been working very closely with the Americans to highlight what Canadians know very , very well ; that the level of integrations between our economies goes both ways across the border , " he said during his daily press conference . 
" That we are receiving essential supplies from the United States , but the United States also receives essential supplies and products and indeed healthcare professionals from Canada very single day . " 
The United States and Canada mutually agreed to close the border to all except essential traffic and commercial trade in March .
