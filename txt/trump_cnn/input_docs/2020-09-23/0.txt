He accused the country of spreading the virus and falsely declaring that there was no evidence of human to human transmission . 
Zhang called Trump ’s accusations lies . 
The ambassador also criticized the US ’ health care system , saying : " This is the country with the most advanced medical system with the most advanced medical technology but still they have ranked # 1 in confirmed cases and lost lives . "
