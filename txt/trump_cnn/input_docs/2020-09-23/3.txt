Asked if there will be a coronavirus vaccine on the Trump administration ’s " political timeline , " Dr . Anthony Fauci on Tuesday said " No . " 
Fauci explained that the data that ’s produced by a vaccine trial is monitored by its Data and Safety Monitoring Board . 
" The only person who sees that data is the unblinded statistician on the Data Safety Monitoring Board , who 's beholden to no one : not to the FDA , not to the President , not to me and not to the company , " he said . 
President Donald Trump has said on more than one occasion that there will be a vaccine available by Election Day in early November -- a timeline that health officials , doctors involved in trials and companies have said is unlikely . 
Fauci added : " If someone tries to make an end run , that is going to be clearly obvious . "
