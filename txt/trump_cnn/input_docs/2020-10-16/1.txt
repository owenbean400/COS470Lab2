The federal government has designated CVS and Walgreens to distribute any coronavirus vaccine that eventually gets authorized to long term care facilities such as nursing homes , Operation Warp Speed officials said Friday . 
The two drug chains are best placed to send out mobile units to vaccinate seniors and other vulnerable people on site , Paul Mango , deputy chief of staff for policy at the Health and Human Services Department , told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
It will be up to the drug chains to figure out how to deliver the vaccines , including cold storage requirements and personal protective equipment . 
It will also be up to the retailers to collect from Medicare , Medicaid or private insurers for administering the vaccines , which must be provided to people free of charge , officials said . 
Mango said the Operation Warp Speed team did not have any idea of how many nursing homes would choose to use the retailers . 
Earlier Friday , President Trump said seniors would be the first to get any vaccine . 
" Seniors will be the first in line for the vaccine . 
And we will soon be ending this pandemic , " Trump said on a visit to Fort Myers .
