Before making his opening statement in Tuesday 's hearing on the US response to the coronavirus pandemic , Senate HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander reiterated his support for wearing masks and his view that President Trump should wear one to eliminate the political stigma around doing so . 
Alexander lamented the politicization of face coverings , saying the growing divide is why he has suggested that the President " occasionally wear a mask , even though in most cases it 's not necessary for him to do so . " 
More on this : On Sunday , Alexander told CNN 's Manu Raju on " Inside Politics " that he thinks it would " help " if President Trump wore a mask . 
As he made these remarks , Alexander told the committee that he was not wearing a mask because he was at least six feet apart from others in the room , as is permitted in the Office of Attending Physician 's guidance .
