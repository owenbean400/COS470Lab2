" We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home , but those who want to come and join us , we 'll be giving out free face masks , if they choose to wear one , " she said . 
However , she added : What we know about the event : According to Recreation.gov , there was an online lottery for tickets , and the park will be closed to general visitation during the event , opening to ticketed guests at 3:00 p.m . local time . 
There may be health screening for ticketed guests in one area , but the website warns : " This event will be attended by thousands . 
Participants will be in close contact for an extended amount of time , please plan accordingly . "
