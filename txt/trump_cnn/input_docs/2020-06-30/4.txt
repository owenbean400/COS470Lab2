President Trump 's campaign has scrapped plans to hold a rally in Alabama next weekend amid concerns about coronavirus infections rising in the US , CNN has learned . 
Trump was slated to travel to the state ahead of the Senate race between his former attorney general Jeff Sessions and the former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville , but plans were called off as state officials quietly voiced concerns about a mass gathering and campaign officials ultimately decided against it . 
A person close to the campaign said there are currently no rallies on the horizon , but aides are scoping out possible venues for when they decide to host them again . 
" We do not ever confirm where we 're looking until a rally date and location are announced . 
There is always work underway to identify sites , " said Tim Murtaugh , communications director for the Trump campaign . 
On Tuesday , Alabama Gov . 
Kay Ivey announced an amended safer at home order , which will extend the current order until the end of July . 
The order encourages minimizing travel outside the home and wearing face coverings when residents do . 
The order also states that " all non work related gatherings of any size , including drive in gatherings , that cannot maintain a consistent six foot distance between persons from different households are prohibited . " 
The decision will likely be a welcome relief for Sessions , who once safely held the seat before becoming Trump 's attorney general but is now locked in a tight race with Tuberville . 
The rally was slated to be held in his hometown .
