Helen Ferré , the communications director for Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis , told CNN the governor " has not given any thought " to requiring masks at Republican National Convention in Jacksonville . 
" Governor De Santis is focused on state business and has not given any thought to that , " Ferré responded when asked whether the governor has the authority to , or the interest in , potentially overriding Jacksonville ’s mask mandate for RNC attendees . 
The city of Jacksonville said Monday that it would adopt a face mask requirement for public and indoor locations and where social distancing is not possible , less than two months before President Trump is set to accept the Republican nomination in the Florida city . 
The new mandate , which goes into effect at 5 p.m . ET on Monday , raised the possibility that attendees could be required to wear face masks at the GOP convention . 
It comes just weeks after Republicans announced that the President would make his speech in the city .
