Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has invited hundreds of guests to the State Department for holiday receptions in the coming weeks , according to two State Department officials familiar with the planning . 
These events , which will offer refreshments and drinks for guests , come as State Department employees have been told not to host holiday gatherings , to maximize teleworking from Thanksgiving until January and continue to receive emails from the department about Covid 19 outbreaks inside the building , the sources said . 
The invitations for one of the events in mid December went out to 900 people and the invite for another went to the 180 foreign ambassadors in the US , the sources said . 
In total , State Department officials are hosting a holiday reception at the State Department or the Blair House almost every day over the next few weeks , two sources familiar with the planned gatherings said . 
With President Trump also hosting events , they said that Pompeo felt enabled to do the same . 
The planned events are leaving State Department career officials enraged , as they have concerns about the parties leading to a greater spread of the virus . 
Career and contracted staff feel like they cannot say no to working the event , one of the officials explained . 
There is concern about the potentially dangerous position this forces people into . 
" It is simply irresponsible , " the first official said , noting that some of the contractors who work in the kitchen may not have health insurance . 
The Washington Post was first to report that more than 900 invites were sent . 
A State Department spokesperson provided the following details about safety plans for holiday parties at the State Department :
