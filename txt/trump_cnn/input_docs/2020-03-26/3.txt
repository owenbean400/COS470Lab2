The Trump adviser said that the administration had " put public health above economics in the very short run . " 
" This is expected , " Navarro repeated , " and we should accept the news because we â€™re doing what we need to do to combat the virus . " 
The administration is doing " everything we possibly can to deal both with the public health emergency and the economic crisis , " he added . 
" We just have to be like the British , I guess , in World War II , a stiff upper lip and fight this virus , " Navarro counseled .
