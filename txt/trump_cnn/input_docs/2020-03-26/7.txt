The coronavirus pandemic may not go away in just a few weeks or so , Dr . Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , said during a Facebook Live Q&A on Thursday . 
" Once we have a vaccine that â€™s effective and widely deployed we can bring the pandemic to an end , " Jha said . 
" Until that time , we are going to continue to have to confront and deal with the virus . " 
Scientists around the world have been working on developing vaccines that are effective against the novel coronavirus and there are dozens in development . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general for the World Health Organization , said in February that a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could take 12 to 18 months . 
Just last week , a vaccine trial in the United States announced that its first patient had received a dose . 
CNN reported last week that a 100 page federal plan on how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic showed the Trump administration is making contingency plans for a pandemic that could stretch up to " 18 months or longer " and could include " multiple waves of illness . "
