President Trump warmed up to the concept of having cruise companies register in the US and pay US taxes in order to receive relief from the federal government for the economic impact of the novel coronavirus . 
Many cruise lines are incorporated overseas , meaning the lines can avoid many US federal taxes , and US labor laws . 
Royal Caribbean 's global headquarters are in Miami but the corporation is incorporated in Liberia , while Carnival Cruise Lines is incorporated in Panama . 
Their ships also fly the flags of those countries meaning employees working on board can be paid far less than US minimum wages . 
Trump said his administration would " maybe really look at that very seriously . "
