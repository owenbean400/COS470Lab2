The Senate has just approved a historic , $ 2 trillion stimulus package in response to the coronavirus pandemic , with a final vote of 96 to zero in favor of the bill . 
Why this matters : The legislation represents the largest emergency aid package in US history and the most significant legislative action taken to address the rapidly intensifying coronavirus crisis , which is overwhelming hospitals and grinding much of the economy to a halt . 
What comes next : The package will next go to the House for a vote . 
The House will convene Friday morning to consider the bill , and the plan is to pass the bill by voice vote . 
President Donald Trump has indicated he will sign the measure . 
What 's in the bill : Key elements of the proposal are $ 250 billion set aside for direct payments to individuals and families , $ 350 billion in small business loans , $ 250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits and $ 500 billion in loans for distressed companies . 
The bill would also provide a major amount of funding for hard hit hospitals -- $ 130 billion -- and $ 150 billion for state and local governments that are cash strapped due to their response to coronavirus . 
It also has a provision that would block Trump and his family , as well as other top government officials and members of Congress , from getting loans or investments from Treasury programs in the stimulus , according to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer 's office .
