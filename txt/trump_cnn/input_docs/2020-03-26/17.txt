President Donald Trump claimed today the US had done more coronavirus testing than any other nation , after receiving domestic criticism over the rate of testing . 
" In fact , over an eight day span , the United States now does more testing than what South Korea ( which has been a very successful tester ) does over an eight week span , " Trump tweeted . 
Fact check : While the US has overtaken South Korea in total numbers of coronavirus tests administered , it has conducted far fewer tests per capita , given the US population is more than six times larger than South Korea 's . 
" Yes , it is true that South Korea has run less tests as an absolute number . 
However , it is important to point out the huge difference in the population sizes , " Aubree Gordon , associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan , told CNN . 
South Korea has a population of 51 million , and has conducted 357,896 tests so far , according to government figures . 
That means one in every 142 South Koreans have been tested . 
The US has a population of 329 million and has conducted 418,810 tests so far , according to the Covid Tracking Project . 
That means one in every 785 Americans have been tested .
