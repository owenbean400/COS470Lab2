Michigan Gov . 
Gretchen Whitmer says she sent a request to President Trump for a major disaster declaration . 
The declaration would allow the state to provide rental assistance and temporary housing to people in the state , counseling and therapy for residents , and the ability to quickly set up field hospitals or other facilities to treat coronavirus patients . 
Whitmer reminded people that the stay at home executive order is not optional and is not an opportunity for people to throw a party for 10 of their closest friends . 
They are meant to stay at home with whom the family members they live . 
She said she is working to secure more equipment and supplies and reiterated her comments about how the allotment of personal protective equipment for one of the hospitals was not enough to cover a full shift .
