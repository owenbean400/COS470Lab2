House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is " very proud of the product " of the congressional negotiations for the coronavirus stimulus bill , ahead of an expected vote in the House tomorrow . 
She said Democrats are already working towards another bill to address some of their unaddressed concerns , including changes for who qualifies for family leave , stronger Occupational Safety and Health Administration protections for workers , boosts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , and more money for state and local governments . 
Pelosi said House Democrats will " be taking the lead " in crafting the next bill , but she emphasized that negotiations should be carried out by the four corners of congressional leadership . 
She said she ’ll mostly be working from DC and the House committee chairs will be involved in the process . 
The House speaker also appeared to push back on President Trump ’s push in recent days to end social distancing by Easter Sunday .
