The former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said he believes the US Food and Drug Administration ’s emergency use authorization ( EUA ) for the use of convalescent plasma in coronavirus patients " was politically driven . " 
FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn admitted Monday to having mischaracterized the benefits of the plasma when he said plasma treatment had saved the lives of 35 out of 100 coronavirus patients . 
In an interview with CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer , Dr . Thomas Frieden called Hahn ’s comments and subsequent apology " a substantial concern . " 
Convalescent plasma has promise , said Frieden , who is now president of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives . 
" It may help some people if given at some dose , at a certain time in infection , " he said . 
" We do not know the answers to those questions , and just saying ‘ use it ’ means we may never learn the answers , or it 'll take longer to learn the answers to those questions , so that 's a big concern . " 
Coronavirus vaccines : Frieden called the plasma EUA announcement a " huge concern " because it ’s a " dry run " for the FDA and the Trump administration in how they ’re going to inform Americans about a coronavirus vaccine . 
Public health experts already worry that a significant number of people wo not consent to any eventual coronavirus vaccine . 
Different vaccines will most likely become available and different vaccines will work differently in different people , Frieden said . 
" We will know something about how well they work , how safe they work , how much of them we ’ll have , who should get them , " he said . 
" Fundamentally , people have to trust them ( the FDA ) or the best vaccine in the world wo not be able to end the pandemic . "
