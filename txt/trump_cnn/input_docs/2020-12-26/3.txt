President elect Joe Biden released a statement calling on President Trump to sign the Covid 19 relief bill that was passed by Congress , saying that any further delay has " devastating consequences . " 
Biden continued : " And while there is hope with the vaccines , we need funding to be able to distribute and administer them to millions of Americans , including frontline health care workers . 
This bill is critical . 
It needs to be signed into law now . " 
The President elect said the latest Covid 19 bill is a " first step and down payment on more action that we ’ll need to take early in the new year to revive the economy and contain the pandemic — including meeting the dire need for funding to distribute and administer the vaccine and to increase our testing capacity . " 
Some context : Though Congress has passed a $ 900 billion Covid relief package , millions of Americans are in danger of losing important benefits just after the holidays if Trump continues to refuse to sign the bill . 
The legislation would extend two pandemic unemployment programs and provide the jobless with a $ 300 weekly federal boost through mid March . 
It would send direct payments of up $ 600 per person . 
It would reopen the Paycheck Protection Program so that some of the hardest hit small businesses can apply for a second loan . 
The package , which would be the second largest relief deal after the $ 2 trillion CARES Act that Congress approved in March , also would extend eviction protection and enhance food stamp benefits .
