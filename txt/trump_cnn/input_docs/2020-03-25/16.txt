The commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , Dr . Stephen Hahn , is warning against self medicating with any form of chloroquine phosphate unless prescribed by a doctor . 
While the anti malaria drug chloroquine has been touted by President Trump as a potential treatment for coronavirus , an Arizona man died this week after taking a form of the substance used in aquariums . 
Hahn said that there is currently " no FDA approved treatment " for Covid 19 , and he said that chloroquine should only be taken if prescribed by a health care provider and obtained from legitimate sources . 
" Some people and companies are trying to profit from the pandemic by selling unproven/illegally marketed products claiming to diagnose , cure , treat or prevent # COVID19 , " Hahn said , adding that " these have NOT been evaluated by FDA for safety and effectiveness & might be dangerous to you and your family . " 
There is limited evidence , partly from studies on human cells , that chloroquine – or its closely related analogue , hydroxychloroquine – could have antiviral effects . 
Doctors in China , France , the US and other countries have used the drug experimentally in Covid 19 patients , but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it 's effective in humans .
