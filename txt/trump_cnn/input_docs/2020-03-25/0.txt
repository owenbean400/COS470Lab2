Hours after Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor told CNN the administration will start wielding the powers in the Defense Production Act for 60,000 tests kits and " use the allocation portion of the DPA , " FEMA press secretary Lizzie Litzow said the agency was able to procure the kits from the private market . 
Earlier Tuesday , Trump and Gaynor contradicted each other on whether the Defense Production Act was being used in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic . 
Around 8 a.m . Tuesday , Trump tweeted , " The Defense Production Act is in full force , but have not had to use it because no one has said NO ! 
Millions of masks coming as back up to States . " 
Minutes later , Gaynor told CNN the administration was going to use the law . 
" Just a little while ago my team came in and we 're actually going to use the DPA for first time today , " Gaynor said . 
In addition , FEMA will " insert some language into these mask contracts we have of 500 million masks , " Gaynor said . 
" DPA language will be in that today . " 
Trump suggested at Tuesday â€™s afternoon briefing that his recent authorization of the DPA serves as enough " leverage " to compel companies to produce medical supplies without invoking the act to force them to start up production .
