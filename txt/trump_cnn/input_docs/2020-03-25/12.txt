President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin are still pushing for an April 6 deadline of having direct payments issued to taxpayers who make less than a certain threshold , a White House official tells CNN , though lawmakers and Internal Revenue Service experts are warning it could take much longer than that . 
Americans with direct deposit bank account information on file with the IRS from tax refunds are expected to receive checks that way , according to aides , while those who do not will likely get a physical check in the mail , which could also take much longer . 
The IRS has sent out economic stimulus checks before , and although those plans were slightly different , they can offer some insight into how long the process might take . 
In 2001 , it took six weeks for the IRS to start sending out rebate checks authorized by President George W . Bush 's tax cut . 
Then in 2008 , amid the Great Recession , it took three months for the checks to start going out after the law was signed by Bush .
