The United States ' coronavirus task force is receiving plenty of feedback from public health experts who are sounding the alarm over easing the social distancing guidelines next week , a source familiar with the matter said . 
Although President Donald Trump has talked about reopening the country by Easter , the President has not reached a final decision on exactly when the government ’s guidelines would be relaxed to get the economy back up and running , the source told CNN . 
Trump is hearing from advisers who are urging him to make Easter more of an " aspirational date , " the source added . 
When the President talked up the idea of packing churches on Easter , the source continued , he knew it was more wishful thinking than a realistic goal . 
" He was being himself , " the source said . 
The current thinking is that it ’s unlikely Trump will relax the social distancing guidelines next week , when the 15 day period for those measures is scheduled to come to an end . 
That kind of a move would likely spark fierce debate inside the task force , the source said . 
Expanding testing : One idea being discussed inside the task force is dramatically expanding self testing for the coronavirus on a massive scale , the source said . 
That would provide public health experts with a wealth of data to make more informed decisions about restarting the economy . 
The problem right now , the source said , is that very little data is available due to the slow rollout of testing across the country .
