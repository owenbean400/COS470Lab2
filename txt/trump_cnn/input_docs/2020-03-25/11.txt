The stimulus legislation prohibits federally elected officials and their immediate relatives from obtaining funds from the Treasury Secretary â€™s $ 500 billion program , according to a draft copy of the bill text . 
The legislation includes a prohibition on distributing funds to businesses that are owned or partly owned by " the President , the Vice President , the head of an Executive department , or a Member of Congress ; and the spouse , child , son in law , or daughter in law . " 
The legislation says that it applies to anyone with a 20 % or greater stake in a business . 
This was a key provision for Democrats concerned that Trump would provide funds to his personal businesses in the stimulus package .
