A top US military medical official said the Pentagon ’s modeling shows the pandemic is likely going to " continue to grow " in the next three weeks , the farthest out he said they were able to model , despite President Trump ’s comments that he wanted the country " opened up " by Easter . 
" We think the best way to limit that growth , or mitigate that growth , are to limit the measures that we ’ve been talking about , " Joint Staff Surgeon Brig . Gen . Paul Friedrichs told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday . 
" I do not think there ’s a great deal of value in speculating on a particular day . " 
Friedrichs further warned , " If we stop doing the right thing today , because we think something is going to happen in four weeks , we will make this worse . 
What we need to do is focus on what we individually and collectively can do today to mitigate this outbreak . " 
" It ’s a worrisome narrative when we try to say there ’s some reason that we should question the guidance that ’s being given out , or there ’s some reason why we should pull apart a shared approach to this , " Friedrichs said . 
" I do not think it matters what day things start to get better . 
What matters is what we ’re doing right now to mitigate this outbreak . "
