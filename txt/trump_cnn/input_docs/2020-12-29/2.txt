Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell blocked Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ’s request for the chamber to pass by unanimous consent the House passed bill increasing the size of direct stimulus checks to individuals from $ 600 to $ 2,000 . 
Mc Connell said on Tuesday that the Senate would consider three of President Trump ’s priorities—further direct financial support for Americans , reexamining Section 230 ’s protections for technology firms and ballot integrity efforts—this week . 
Mc Connell ’s remark about bringing Trump ’s priorities " into focus , " was not a commitment to bringing votes on the issues . 
Schumer urged the Senate to join Trump and the House to increase the size of the checks , arguing that " working Americans have taken it on the chin " during the pandemic . 
" The fastest way to get money into Americans pockets , is to send some of their tax dollars right back from where they came , " he added . 
Watch Sen . 
Mc Connell object :
