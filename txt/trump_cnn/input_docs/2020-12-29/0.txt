The House of Representatives on Monday passed a measure to increase stimulus checks for Americans under a certain income level to $ 2,000 after President Donald Trump championed the effort , sending the bill to the Senate where its future is less certain . 
The legislation , which passed with a 275-134 vote , comes a day after Trump signed a sweeping coronavirus relief bill into law Sunday evening . 
That measure , which was negotiated on a bipartisan basis , provides for $ 600 in direct payments , but after a deal was brokered and passed out of Congress , Trump railed against the amount as too low and called for $ 2,000 checks instead , prompting House Democrats to push for an increase . 
Democrats have seized on Trump 's 11th hour complaint over the direct payments in a bid to push congressional Republicans to accept a higher amount , forcing GOP lawmakers to decide whether or not to defy the President after many have argued that the overall cost for a stimulus package should not rise too high .
