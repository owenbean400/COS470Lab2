Vice President Mike Pence reiterated President Trump ’s threat to move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina . 
He continued : " And I think the President is absolutely intent on ensuring that as we see our nation continue to make steady progress on putting the coronavirus epidemic in the past , that come this August , we ’ll be able to come together in a safe and responsible venue and re nominate President Donald Trump for four more years . " 
Pence said Trump ’s request of Gov . 
Roy Cooper was " very reasonable . " 
Some background : Trump began a solemn Memorial Day railing against North Carolina Gov . 
Roy Cooper , a Democrat , ahead of the 2020 Republican National Convention , threatening to pull it out of Charlotte , where the convention is expected to be held August 24 to 27 . 
Trump contended that Cooper is " unable to guarantee " that the arena can be filled to capacity . 
After the tweets , Pence insisted " we all want to be in Charlotte , we love North Carolina , but having a sense now is absolutely essential because of the rules and regulations that are involved . " 
" We look forward to working with Gov . 
Cooper , getting a swift response , and , if need be , moving the national convention to a state that is farther along on reopening and can say with confidence that we can gather there , " Pence said .
