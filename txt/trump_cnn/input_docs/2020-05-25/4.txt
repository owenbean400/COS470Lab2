The leaders are House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions committee ranking member Patty Murray and House Energy and Commerce committee chair Frank Pallone . 
They continued : " We still need clear explanations for how targets were set , how they will be met and what will be done if they are not . 
The Trump Administration still does not take any responsibility for ramping up our nation â€™s testing capacity , instead pushing the burden onto the states , " they said .
