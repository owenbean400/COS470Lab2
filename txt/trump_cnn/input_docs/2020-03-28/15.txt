In another sign of how Vice President Mike Pence is managing relationships with certain Democratic governors differently than President Trump , Pence spoke with Michigan Gov . 
Gretchen Whitmer on Saturday morning , per a tweet from her account . 
Whitmer , whom Trump has criticized for being insufficiently " appreciative " and " way in over her head " in recent days , posted on Twitter that she had a " good call with @ VP this morning " and that the state of Michigan had just received a delivery of 112,000 additional N95 respirators . 
Some context : Trump on Friday said he had advised Pence not to call Whitmer or other governors who have been critical of the federal response . 
" You know what I say ? 
If they do not treat you right , I do not call , " Trump said , before noting that Pence is " a different type of person " and will " call quietly anyway . " 
CNN reached out to Pence â€™s office for comment .
