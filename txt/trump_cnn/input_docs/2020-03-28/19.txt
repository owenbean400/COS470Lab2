Joe Biden praised the $ 2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump today , but worried that the largest emergency aid package in US history might not be enough to save the small businesses ravaged by the crisis . 
Biden said the provision in the bill that blocks executives from buying back stock was a good step in assuring that those who need the help get it , but pushed for additional government action if banks do not start pumping out capital . 
" We have to make sure the small business loans you get and/or the low interest loans you get . 
They are in a position where we 're going to say to the banks you got to get them out the door . 
As you know , they 're not very good at getting out the door the small business loans , " Biden said . 
The former vice president also suggested that , should banks fail to recapitalize those businesses , the White House should consider finding some executive authority â€“ " another version of the Defense Production Act " -- as a way , he said , to " keep the economy in better shape than anything else we 're doing . "
