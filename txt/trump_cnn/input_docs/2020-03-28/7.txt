President Trump signed an executive order Friday afternoon which could potentially lead to former active duty military members being recalled into service . 
This order grants the Defense Secretary the authority to order up members but as of now , there is no indication of anyone being called up . 
" This is a dynamic situation , we do not currently have a projected number of expected activations , but the Department is now fully authorized to make activations as needed . 
We will provide updates as they become available , " Hoffman added . 
In most cases , after concluding their military obligations , service members will enter into what is known as the Individual Ready Reserve . 
Some context : That ready reserve status requires no active participation , leading the vast majority of service members to consider being in that status the same as being out of the military . 
Most service members are in that designation for a period of years . 
There have been a handful of cases in the past where members of this reserve have been called up for active duty â€” such as during the height of both Iraq wars . 
Usually this is used when the military needs some specific skill sets .
