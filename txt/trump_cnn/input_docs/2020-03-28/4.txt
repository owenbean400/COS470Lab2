Joe Biden said Friday that he , as president , would recommend every governor lock down their states for several weeks to stop the spread of the coronavirus . 
The question stemmed from billionaire investor Bill Gates telling CNN on Thursday that the United States should shut down the entire country for a short period of time to control the spread of the coronavirus . 
Gates suggested closing for six to 10 weeks . 
Biden added that " two weeks in what is going to be a long fight to deal with this is a small price to pay , " adding that is especially the case because the country can " compensate people for the lost time " with legislation like the sweeping bill that President Donald Trump signed on Friday . 
Biden did not explicitly endorse the length of Gates ' suggestion . 
Biden â€™s comments stand in opposition to Trump , who has not called for a nationwide lockdown and has said he hopes the nation will re open by mid April .
