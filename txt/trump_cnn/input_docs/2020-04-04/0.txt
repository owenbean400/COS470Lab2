US President Donald Trump again signaled his resistance to issuing a national stay at home order to slow the spread of the coronavirus -- despite comments from Dr . Anthony Fauci this week questioning why such an order has not been issued for all states . 
The majority of states have issued orders for residents to stay in their homes , but the federal government has not mandated people do so . 
" I guess we ’re close to 90 % anyway , " Trump said of the number of people mandated to stay home . 
At least 41 states and the District of Columbia have issued stay at home orders . 
" States that we ’re talking about are not in jeopardy , " Trump said , referring to the handful of states that have not yet issued such orders . 
" I like that from the standpoint of governing , and even from the standpoint of our Constitution , " the President said of his inclination to allow states to make their own decisions about ordering people not to leave their houses . 
The federal government has issued guidance recommending that people stay home as much as possible and avoid gathering in groups larger than 10 .
