President Trump said his use of the Defense Production Act ( DPA ) was in part " retaliation " on companies that have not given the government what they have asked for . 
Some context : Last night , Trump invoked the DPA to " to ensure that certain health and medical resources are allocated for domestic use " according to a statement released by the White House announcing the action . 
Trump specifically mentioned 3M and said he wants that company to provide masks to America instead of sending masks to other places . 
" FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million — think of that — 180 million . 
Who ever heard of 180 million N95 masks , and we 're working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out , but we want them to help our country , and I think it 's going to be okay . 
We 're going to soon let you know , but we need the masks . 
We do not want other people getting it , " Trump said .
