After US President Donald Trump refused to wear a mask in front of cameras during his visit to a Ford manufacturing plant on Thursday , Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel did not hold back in her condemnation . 
" Today 's events were extremely disappointing and yet totally predictable , " Nessel told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer during an interview . 
On Tuesday , Ford said it had shared its safety policies with the White House -- including that everyone wear a mask " in all facilities , at all times " -- but added that " the White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination . " 
Nessel said Trump 's failure to comply with the plant 's guidelines is consistent with his behavior to this point . 
" The message he 's sent is the same message since he first took office in 2017 , which is I do not care about you , I do not care about your health , I do not care about your safety , I do not care about your welfare , I do not care about anyone but myself . " 
Nessel also took issue with the Ford facility for seemingly bending the rules specifically for the commander in chief . 
" They knew exactly what the order was and if they permitted anyone , even the President of the United States , to defy that order , I think it has serious health consequences potentially to their workers , " Nessel said . 
She added : " The last thing we want to see is for this particular plant now to have to close its doors and shutter its doors again because someone may have been infected by the President . 
And that is a real possibility . " 
Nessel had a message for her constituents : " Even if you do not have a President of the United States that cares about the residents of this state , fortunately you have a governor and you have an attorney general who do . 
And we are going to do everything in our power to protect you , even if you have a President who wo not . "
