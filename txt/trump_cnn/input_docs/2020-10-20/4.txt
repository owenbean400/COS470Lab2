Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell confirmed Tuesday that if a stimulus deal is reached between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin , and is supported by President Trump , then " we would put it on the floor of the Senate and let the Senate consider it . " 
But Mc Connell would not say if he was comfortable with a price tag around $ 1.8 trillion or $ 2 trillion as President Trump is pushing . 
When asked by CNN ’s Manu Raju about the high price tag the President is asking for in a stimulus deal , higher than $ 2.2 trillion , and whether he ’s personally comfortable with spending that amount of money , Mc Connell said , " What I 'm telling you is that if such a deal were to clear the House , obviously , with a presidential signature promise , we would put it on the floor of the Senate and let the Senate consider it . " 
Mc Connell also dodged a question on whether it ’s appropriate for the President to continue to attack the nation ’s top infectious diseases expert Dr . Anthony Fauci during his weekly policy news conference .
