House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday she is optimistic that Democrats can strike a deal with the Trump administration for another coronavirus stimulus package . 
" We all want to get an agreement because people need it . 
It ’s urgent , and our economy needs it , " Pelosi said . 
" Hopefully by the end of the day today , we ’ll know where we all are . " 
Pelosi also downplayed her previous deadline for a deal prior to the election — which she said Sunday would be the end of the day Tuesday . 
" Let me just say , it is not that this day was the day that we would have a deal . 
It was the day where we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step . 
And again , legislation takes a long time , " she said . 
Pelosi said she hopes to have the potential legislation finalized this week with passage by next Friday .
