House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues about stimulus negotiations , " Until these serious issues are resolved , we remain at an impasse . " 
She also said , " it is hard to understand who is shaping their approach , which to date has been a miserable and deadly failure . " 
Some context : Pelosi and Senate Republicans on Saturday balked at President Trump 's roughly $ 1.8 trillion stimulus proposal , making it all but certain Congress wo not pass an economic relief package before election day . 
On Saturday , Pelosi called the counteroffer Trump made Friday " insufficient " and " amounted to one step forward , two steps back " in negotiations , underscoring that there are several major outstanding policy issues to work out . 
" At this point , we still have disagreement on many priorities , and Democrats are awaiting language from the Administration on several provisions as the negotiations on the overall funding amount continue , " Pelosi wrote in a letter Saturday to House Democrats . 
Pelosi 's cool reception to the $ 1.8 trillion offer from Trump — the administration 's highest offer thus far in the months long talks — comes as Republicans have made clear to their respective leaders they want no part of a deal this big , which Senate Leader Mitch Mc Connell and House Minority Leader Kevin Mc Carthy have communicated to the White House .
