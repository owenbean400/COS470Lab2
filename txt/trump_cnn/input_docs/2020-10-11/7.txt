Arkansas Gov . 
Asa Hutchinson told CNN that he hopes both presidential candidates can set an example to help keep the spread of coronavirus down as winter approaches . 
When asked about the lack of mitigation efforts in place at President Trump 's events and rallies , the governor responded : " They offer masks , they do screening whenever they come to the rallies , certainly we want to have an engagement in the presidential campaign this year . " 
Hutchinson added that " there should not be any mass gathering without social distancing " or wear a mask " if you 're going to sit next to somebody . " 
" A large part of it is simply the nature of the virus and if you do not take the right protections it 's going to spread , " Hutchinson said about the rising cases in his state .
