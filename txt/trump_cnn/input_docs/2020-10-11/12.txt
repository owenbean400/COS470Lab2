Twitter has attached a warning label to President Trump ’s tweet where he claimed , without evidence , that he is immune to coronavirus after receiving the all clear from his physician to resume public activities . 
Trump also claimed immunity in an interview on Fox News where he said he believes he will be immune for " maybe a long time , maybe a short time , could be a lifetime , " noting it ’s unclear how much immunity previously infected individuals can expect after recovering . 
Some crucial context : There is no evidence that people are immune if they have been infected once and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically cautions people not to assume they are immune . 
Twitter ’s warning label says the tweet " violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid 19 . " 
According to a statement from Twitter : " We placed a public interest notice on the Tweet you referenced for violating our Covid 19 Misleading Information Policy by making misleading health claims about Covid 19 . 
As is standard with this public interest notice , engagements with the Tweet will be significantly limited . "
