People in the United States should " absolutely " be afraid of the coronavirus , despite President Trump ’s assertion that Americans should not let it dominate their lives , said Dr . Jeffrey Koplan , a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
" There are 210,000 people who 've passed away , who hopefully need not have in different circumstances , " Koplan said during CNN ’s Coronavirus : Facts and Fears town hall Saturday . 
Circumstances conducive to saving lives include listening to public health experts and embracing public health measures . 
" But if your bosses -- if the people up the chain of command are not supporting you , if the people up the chain of command are spreading false information , belittling important news and actions that need to be taken -- it does not work , " said Koplan , who is vice president of the Emory Global Health Institute . 
Koplan said changing course is " doable . " 
" We can do something about it . 
We can start right now , and should have . 
And in some parts of the country , the appropriate things are being done . 
But … when your leadership is working against you in this virus , the virus has an ally that makes it a pretty strong contender for further destruction . "
