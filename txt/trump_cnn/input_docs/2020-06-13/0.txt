President Trump will soon address approximately 1,100 graduates who have gathered at the US Military Academy at West Point for the annual commencement exercises . 
The class of 2020 West Point graduates can be seen wearing face coverings and standing socially distanced from each other at the ceremony held across the Plain Parade Field . 
Other Covid 19 protection measures : The students were coronavirus tested and separated into groups of 250 to live , work and eat together for a two week quarantine leading up to the graduation address . 
Family and friends will not be allowed to attend the ceremony but can watch it online . 
West Point has made every effort to keep Saturday 's commencement ceremony " as close to normal as possible , " Lt . 
Col . Chris Ophardt told CNN in an interview Friday . 
" Instead of being handed the diploma , they will render a salute from a small stage that 's about 15 feet in front of where the President will be standing , " Ophardt said . 
" So when their name gets read , instead of getting handed a diploma ... they 'll step forward and they 'll salute the President ; 
President and Lt . 
Gen . Williams will salute back , and then they 'll leave the stage , and that will be their recognition . "
