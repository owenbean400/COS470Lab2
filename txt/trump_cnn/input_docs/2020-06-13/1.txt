President Donald Trump will address approximately 1,100 graduates who have gathered at the US Military Academy at West Point , New York , for annual commencement exercises Saturday morning -- but the graduation will look very different from those in years past . 
The students were coronavirus tested and separated into groups of 250 to live , work and eat together for a two week quarantine leading up to the graduation address . 
They will be socially distanced 6 feet from one another across the Plain Parade Field instead of at Michie Stadium , the traditional location for the graduation . 
Family and friends will not be allowed to attend the ceremony , but can watch it online . 
In an interview Friday , Lt . 
Col . Chris Ophardt told CNN that West Point has made every effort to keep Saturday 's commencement ceremony " as close to normal as possible . " 
Trump surprised many by announcing in April that he would speak at the ceremony despite the pandemic . 
Vice President Mike Pence spoke during the Air Force commencement ceremony in April . 
The President said at the time that he was looking forward to the event , adding that though he does not like " the look " of a socially distanced crowd , " eventually , next year , they 'll have a commencement like it 's been ... nice and tight . "
