Former United States Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Monday that President Donald Trump 's comments that��"nothing more could have been done " to handle the coronavirus pandemic was " absurd . " 
" By mid April here in the northeast in the New York New Jersey area where I live , the densest part of the country , we knew how to flatten the curve , " Johnson said . 
" We knew how to slow the spread of the virus through aggressive physical distancing , through hygiene , wearing masks , but after April even though things slowed down here in the northeast , we had the spikes in the rest of the country simply because our national leadership , our President , allowed this to become a political issue . " 
Some context : Trump 's comments were from an Aug . 14 call he made to veteran journalist Bob Woodward . 
It was their 19th conversation , following 18 interviews that formed a key component of Woodward 's book " Rage . " 
Trump had privately told Woodward in February he knew critical details about how deadly the virus was , and in March admitted he was playing it down .
