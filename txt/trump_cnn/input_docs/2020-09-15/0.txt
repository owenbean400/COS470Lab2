Nevada 's Democratic Gov . 
Steve Sisolak skewered President Trump for hosting a large indoor campaign rally in his state with little social distancing , telling CNN 's Erin Burnett that the President acted selfishly . 
" He only cares about himself , " said Sisolak . 
In holding the rally , Trump was defying an executive order from Sisolak , who has banned gatherings of more than 50 people . 
On Sunday , Trump defended the Henderson event , telling the Las Vegas Journal Review he did not believe he was subject to the rules , and added the he felt safe . 
" I ’m on a stage and it ’s very far away , " Trump said . 
" And so I ’m not at all concerned . " 
Sisolak today blasted Trump 's defense of the event , calling his comments " a joke . " 
" That 's just the ego and the arrogance , " said Sisolak . 
" That 's just a joke . 
We do not make laws and say they apply to everybody except Donald J . Trump . " 
The governor continued : " It 's absurd for him to think the rules did not apply to him ... 
I think he just does not much care . " 
Sisolak also responded to new tapes obtained by CNN in which Trump told veteran journalist Bob Woodward " nothing more could have been done " to stop Covid 19 's spread in the US . 
Sisolak called those remarks " absolutely ridiculous . " 
" So much more could have been done if there would had been an organized national response we would have saved thousands and thousands of lives but it was not important to the President so he chose to just ignore it , " he said .
