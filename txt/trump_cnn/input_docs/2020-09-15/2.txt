After her husband died of Covid 19 , Sondra Wolfe wants people to see the human lives behind the numbers . 
She described her husband , Mike , as a great father , grandfather and husband . 
She said losing him is leaving a big hole in their family and community . 
" He took care of all of us . 
He was just an all around great guy , " Wolfe said . 
She said it is frustrating that President Trump and other federal leaders did not act on the severity of the pandemic earlier . 
" Other countries have this under control and are protecting their citizens , and that they 've made this political and about an election and about ratings , just makes me angry . 
This is about people and lives , " she said . 
" It is not going away , " she added . 
" It is not political . 
It is a health crisis and we need to do what we can to take care of each other . " 
She urged people to wear masks and have empathy , saying that simple action could save lives . 
" If you would pass this on to somebody else , how would it make you feel . 
If your selfishness was responsible for somebody 's death , " Wolfe said .
