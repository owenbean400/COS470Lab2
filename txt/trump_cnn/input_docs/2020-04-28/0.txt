US President Donald Trump says he takes no responsibility for a spike in people using disinfectants improperly after he suggested ingesting disinfectant as a cure for coronavirus last week . 
He answered , " No , I do not " when asked if he takes any responsibility for the numbers . 
Some context : Trump asked his medical team to look into the possibility of using disinfectants as a way to cure the virus inside the body during a coronavirus briefing last Thursday . 
He has since claimed that the comments were " sarcastic . "
