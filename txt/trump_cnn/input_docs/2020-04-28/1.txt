US President Donald Trump said he " never even thought " of changing the date of the upcoming presidential election on November 3 , despite former Vice President Joe Biden suggesting Trump would attempt a delay . 
Trump added that Biden never said he would try to delay the election -- despite Biden saying those words exactly during a virtual fundraiser last week , according to a pool report . 
Trump cannot unilaterally change the date of the election in November , as it has been set into law by federal statute and Congress would have to approve such a move . 
However , that has not stopped some Democrats from worrying that he will try to do so , and voters asked the previously large field of Democratic presidential candidates if they had concerns that Trump would try to delay the election or refuse to leave office if he were defeated in November .
