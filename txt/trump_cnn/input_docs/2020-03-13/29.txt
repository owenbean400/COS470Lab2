One of nearly 900 attendees at a Trump Victory fundraiser brunch last Sunday at President Donald Trump ’s Mar a Lago club has tested positive for coronavirus . 
Trump Victory , the merged efforts between Trump ’s re election campaign and the Republican National Committee , informed attendees in an email Friday . 
" We unfortunately write today to notify you that an attendee at the Trump Victory sponsored event you attended at Mar a Lago on Sunday , March 8 , has tested positive for the Coronavirus ( COVID 19 ) . 
We do not know if the individual had the virus by the time of the event , but out of an abundance of caution , wanted to call this to your attention , " the letter said , encouraging supporters to contact their medical provider if they develop symptoms . 
Trump participated in a photo line and gave a speech , per a source familiar with the event . 
Approximately 70-100 people participated in the photo line . 
Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CNN " there was no interaction " between the attendee who has tested positive and the President . 
" Attendees had no direct interaction with the President at this event and the VP did not attend this event , " a Republican official reiterated . 
Though it ’s unknown if the person had the virus while they attended the brunch , it ’s another example of the risks of exposure in large group settings . 
This week , the Trump campaign made the decision to cancel rallies and move other campaign events to a virtual forum for the foreseeable future as the outbreak progresses .
