President Trump announced new measures aimed at easing the burden of student loans as universities and colleges across the country shut their doors , as well as measures aimed at taking advantage of low oil prices . 
" I ’ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies , and that will be until further notice , " Trump said during an appearance in the Rose Garden , noting the number of schools that have sent students home amid the growing coronavirus outbreak . 
The President also said he has directed the Secretary of Energy " to purchase large quantities of crude oil for the US strategic reserves . " 
Oil prices have tumbled in recent days – particularly as the demand for jet fuel has plummeted as global travel slows dramatically amid various bans on international movement . 
" That ’s something that would have not even been possible a week ago , " Trump said of the large scale purchase he was ordering the Energy Department to make . 
" So we ’re going to fill it up , it ’s a good time to fill it up , " he said of the strategic crude oil reserves .
