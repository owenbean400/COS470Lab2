President Trump said he 's considering adding the UK into the list of European countries with travel restrictions to the US â€” and he could take others off the list . 
Trump said Wednesday he was sharply restricting travel to the United States from more than two dozen European countries . 
This list did not include the UK , which has seen a rise in coronavirus cases since the announcement . 
" We may have to include them in the list of countries that we will , you could say , ban or whatever it is , during this period of time , " Trump said when asked why he did not include the UK on the list . 
" The numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours . 
" He continued : " And we may be adding a couple of others . 
And we may , frankly , start thinking about taking some off . "
