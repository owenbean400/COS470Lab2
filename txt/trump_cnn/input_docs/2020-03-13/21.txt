President Trump said the emergency orders issued today will also " confer broad new authorities " to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar . 
Azar will be able to " waive provisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors , hospitals — all hospitals — and health care providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus , " he said . 
That includes waivers of some federal licensing requirements , waivers to critical access limits on numbers of beds and lengths of stays , and waivers to rules to bring additional physicians on board at certain hospitals .
