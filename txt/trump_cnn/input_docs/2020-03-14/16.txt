The Supreme Court has closed its doors to the public until " further notice " as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic ripples across the country , raising questions about how the justices will handle the next set of oral arguments scheduled to begin March 23 . 
The pandemic could mean changes not just to public access but to how the justices interact with each other as they enter the last few months of a term that includes an unprecedented number of consequential and controversial cases . 
The session includes a blockbuster case at the end of the month concerning President Trump 's bid to shield his financial documents from disclosure . 
What the justices are doing in the meantime : The justices are mostly lying low and taking advantage of a brief recess from arguments . 
Scheduled speaking events for Justices Sonia Sotomayor , Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas have all been recently cancelled . 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh , however , traveled to Kentucky Friday for the ceremonial swearing in of a lower court judge . 
But this Sunday , the court 's oldest member Ruth Bader Ginsburg turns 87 years old â€” and while she often wears lace gloves in public , as a survivor of 4 bouts of cancer is in a high risk group for almost any illness . 
A majority of her colleagues also qualify as " older adults " at higher risk of getting sick , according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Besides Ginsburg , Breyer is 81 , Thomas , 71 , Samuel Alito 69 and Chief Justice John Roberts and Sotomayor are 65 . 
That fact alone raises questions of how the court should handle upcoming arguments in a chamber that holds about 500 people and it highlights the fact that the court does not allow same day audio much less cameras in the court room .
