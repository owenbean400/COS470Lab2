US President Donald Trump sent a note to supporters earlier today that featured a chart showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average dramatically rising roughly at the time he began a news conference declaring a national emergency over the coronavirus . 
He also signed the chart . 
The note , which was also sent to some members of Congress , included screenshots of television coverage of the stock market closing much higher than Thursday . 
" The President would like to share the attached image with you , and passes along the following message : ' From opening of press conference , biggest day in stock market history ! ' 
" read the note , a copy of which was obtained by CNN . 
Friday was the best day for stocks since 2008 , but the S&P 500 ended the week with sharp losses and fell into a bear market on Thursday . 
An ongoing crisis : The message did not mention the overall coronavirus crisis , the number of people who have died or are sick , nor the fact that Trump had just declared a national emergency . 
In the US , more than 2,200 people had been diagnosed with coronavirus and 49 have died .
