A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration federal rule from going into effect next month that could have seen nearly 700,000 people lose access to food stamps , noting in part a need for flexibility as state and federal officials work to address nutritional needs during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Some context : In an order handed down Friday , the Howell granted a preliminary injunction and a stay on portions of a federal rule from the US Department of Agriculture . 
The rule , announced in December , would require more food stamp recipients to work in order to receive benefits by limiting states ' ability to waive existing work mandates .
