President Donald Trump â€™s backing of the legislation cleared the way for a broad , bipartisan vote . 
The Senate is expected to take up the measure when it returns to session next week . 
What 's in the bill : The broad legislative package includes provisions for paid emergency leave and free coronavirus testing . 
Trump tweeted his support for the bill earlier this evening , after Pelosi announced a deal with the administration . 
The deal came together after intense back and forth negotiation between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , and prolonged uncertainty over whether and when a consensus deal could be struck -- with House Democrats warning that they would go ahead and pass legislation one way or another . 
In a series of tweets , Trump put an end to the uncertainty by saying " I fully support " the legislation .
