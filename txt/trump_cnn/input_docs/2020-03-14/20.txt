President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said today that the administration is considering some domestic travel restrictions , specifically with regards to certain areas hard hit with the coronavirus . 
Trump did not provide any specifics or a possible timeframe . 
" We are considering a broad range of measures , " Pence added during the briefing . 
There have been internal discussions about restricting travel to areas in Washington state and other places considered " hot spots " for the virus . 
It ’s unclear how far along they are in implementing them , people familiar with the matter told CNN . 
There are preliminary conversations about halting some air or train travel between some major US cities as a potential additional step going forward . 
Homeland Security , Customs and Border Protection and Department of Transportation officials have discussed possibilities with the coronavirus task force , according to a person familiar with the matter . 
Some flights have already slowed to those places and there ’s an expectation that if other hotspots pop up , flights would similarly slow down due to lack of demand , which might mean they do not need to put formal restrictions in place .
