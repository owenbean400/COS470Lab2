US President Donald Trump does not need to be tested or quarantined for coronavirus despite being in proximity to infected dignitaries at Mar a Lago , the White House physician said in a statement today . 
Three members of a Brazilian delegation that traveled to the US have tested positive . 
One of them was seated at the same dinner table as Trump at Mar a Lago last Saturday , while another shook the President ’s hand and took a photograph with him , according to the physician ’s statement . 
There has been some flip flopping about this : On Thursday , the White House press secretary said Trump and Vice President Mike Pence " do not require being tested at this time . " 
Then on Friday , when asked about it by a reporter , Trump said he would " likely " receive a coronavirus test " fairly soon . " 
The White House was constantly evaluating whether to test the President and take measures to prevent the virus from spreading among Trump 's close confidants , according to one senior official , who said aides are keenly aware of the optics of testing the commander in chief .
