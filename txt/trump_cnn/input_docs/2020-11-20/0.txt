The rural hospital system in the United States is struggling to manage the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The spike of cases in rural America in the past few weeks has been a " challenge on a number of levels , " said Tom Morris , associate administrator for rural health policy in the federal government ’s Health Resources and Services Administration . 
Morris made the comments Thursday during the National Institutes of Health rural health seminar . 
Rural hospitals are small : Of the 2,000 hospitals considered to be rural , about 1,700 have 50 beds or fewer and 1,300 of them have 25 beds or fewer , said Morris , whose agency is part of the Health and Human Services Department . 
" We ’re not talking about large facilities . 
We ’re not talking about a lot of ICU capacity , " Morris said . 
" In a lot of these hospitals , they ’re able to offer an ICU of one or two beds . 
So , they have very limited inpatient resources . " 
Limited work force : The rural medical work force needed to care for Covid 19 patients is extremely limited , he said , as is the supply chain that would provide protective equipment . 
Many of these hospitals are also " financially vulnerable , " Morris said . 
Hospitals are closing : Morris said the Trump administration has given $ 150 million to the 1,700 50 bed rural hospitals to help with the extra costs of the pandemic . 
Rural hospitals , health clinics and community health centers also got an extra $ 11 billion to offset the losses they were facing due to the pandemic . 
But still , 17 rural hospitals have shut this year , adding to the 130 rural hospitals that have closed since 2010 . 
" We have many more rural hospitals that are at a financial risk and have been for quite some time , " Morris said , " The pandemic has not made any of that easier . "
