President Trump said he will " certainly listen " to health experts when it comes to returning to normalcy and removing social distancing guidelines . 
Trump 's aides have begun intensive discussions on a plan to reopen the US economy as soon as the start of May , according to people familiar with the deliberations — though health experts warn it 's far too early to declare mission accomplished and begin removing social distancing protocols . 
CNN 's Jim Acosta asked Trump if he 'll listen to health officials if they advise him it 's too soon to open . 
" If they come back to you , sir , and say ' Before May the 1st — we ca not open on May the 1st , ' will you listen ? " he asked . 
" Remember , I understand the other side of the argument very well . 
Because I look at both sides of an argument . 
I will listen to them very carefully , though , " Trump added .
