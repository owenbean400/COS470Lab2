Dr . Anthony Fauci said there " is no doubt you 're going to see cases " when some of the current social distancing restrictions are relaxed . 
Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said when restrictions are lifted and cases emerge , " that 's where you want your resources to be able to very efficiently in real time identify , isolate , and contact trace . " 
President Trump said that while he is hoping to reopen the country by a certain date , he wo not do anything until he knows the country will be healthy . 
He added that he does not want to have the country " go back " and then have to implement restrictions again . 
" We are looking at a date . 
We hope we are going to be able to fulfill a certain date , but we are not doing anything until we know that this country is going to be healthy . 
We do not want to go back and start doing it over again , even though it would be in a smaller scale , " Trump said .
