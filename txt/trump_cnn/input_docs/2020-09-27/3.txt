House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNN ’s " State of the Union " that House Democrats may offer their latest stimulus proposal as legislation if revived talks with the Trump administration do not yield a deal her party can get behind . 
Where things stand : Weeks after the last round of stimulus talks fell apart , where both sides were dug in behind topline funding numbers that were more than a trillion dollars apart , Pelosi expressed optimism Sunday that she could reach a deal in negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin . 
CNN has reported that some House Democrats have become anxious to get some kind of stimulus legislation passed before Congress breaks for the campaign season , fearing anger from voters if they fail to do so . 
" When I have a conversation with the administration it is in good faith . 
I trust Secretary Mnuchin to represent something that can reach a solution , and I believe we can come to an agreement , " Pelosi said . 
Although House Democrats have prepared a new proposal with a price tag of around $ 2.2 trillion , Pelosi said the stimulus her party envisions may end up costing more . 
" The President ’s denial of the virus and just resistance to doing anything to crush it has made matters worse in so many ways , " she said , citing restaurants , small businesses and American workers . 
" So we may need more money than that . 
We will reveal what that is in a short period of time . " 
Pressed by Tapper on whether she would offer the proposal as a bill if a deal remains elusive , Pelosi did not rule out the prospect . 
" That is definitely a possibility . 
But I ’m hoping for a deal . 
I ’d rather have a deal which puts money in people ’s pockets rather than to have rhetorical argument , " she said . 
The Trump administration has floated $ 1.5 trillion as the highest topline figure it is willing to consider , meaning the two sides still do not agree on the scope of the problem .
