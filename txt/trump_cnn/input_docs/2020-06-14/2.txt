Trump campaign and Tulsa GOP officials say more than 300,000 people have expressed interest in attending President Trump ’s rally in Tulsa . 
Since the rally site , the Bank of Oklahoma Center , only holds around 20,000 people , there are currently discussions about whether they will add a second event , the campaign and one official said . 
As for the potential of massive crowds gathering in a city that is in the middle of a coronavirus spike , there are currently no plans to practice social distancing at the rally according to one GOP official . 
The campaign has not responded to numerous requests for comment regarding what precautions it will take at the rally because of Covid 19 . 
The campaign and local organizers plan on the event being held in a packed arena . 
The GOP official told CNN that there were ongoing discussions among organizers and the campaign as to what precautions , if any , will be put place , including possible temperature scans for supporters before they ’re allowed inside the arena . 
This official said a temperature check is consistent with what many businesses in the state are doing as they reopen . 
With the caveat that the plans are not finalized , the official told CNN that as of now masks would be optional , and noted that the President himself does not like wearing a mask and it ’s up to individuals to decide .
