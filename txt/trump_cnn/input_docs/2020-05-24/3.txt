White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNN he thinks the unemployment rate will reach " north of 20 % " for the month of May . Hassett said he expects the rate will be even higher in June than in May , but after that " it should start to trend down . " 
Hassett thinks it is possible that the unemployment rate could still be in double digits in November , but he said he thinks " all the signs of economic recovery are going to be raging everywhere . " 
Pressed further by Bash , Hassett doubled down on his prediction for November , saying it would take a while for the unemployment rate to go down and adding that a vaccine breakthrough could change things . 
Hassett said President Trump is " going through all the options " related to another phase of economic stimulus .
