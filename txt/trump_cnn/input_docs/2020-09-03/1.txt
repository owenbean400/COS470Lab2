Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said the White House Coronavirus Task Force is not discussing herd immunity as a strategy to control the coronavirus pandemic , even though President Donald Trump frequently mentions it as a means of making the pandemic " go away . " 
Herd immunity occurs when enough people are infected or vaccinated in a community that a pathogen stops circulating . 
" That 's not a fundamental strategy that we 're using , " Fauci said in an interview Wednesday with MSNBC â€™s Andrea Mitchell . 
" We 're not there yet . " 
" The fundamental strategy that we clearly articulate and go by , through the task force , is to try to prevent as many infections as you possibly can prevent , " he added . 
" When you get someone who 's infected , you do the identification , isolation and contact tracing and you do the kinds of things to prevent infections . " 
Fauci said he did not understand what Trump was referring to in his comments about herd immunity .
