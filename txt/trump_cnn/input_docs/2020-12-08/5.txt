The White House coronavirus task force is warning states that current vaccination plans wo not reduce the spread of the disease until at least the late spring . 
Even as President Trump said Tuesday the US vaccination plan would " quickly and dramatically reduce deaths and hospitalizations and within a short period of time , I think we want to get back to normal , " his task force told states in a weekly report that mitigation measures were still essential to preventing further contagion . 
The reports , which are distributed to states on a weekly basis , said that while the " imminent arrival of vaccines provides hope , " the effect of the effort would takes months to materialize . 
" Large scale benefits of lower deaths and hospitalizations will only come after months of immunization , " the report said . 
" Difficult but temporary changes in personal behavior are key to limiting disease and death until we bring the pandemic to an end with immunization ; this messaging must be delivered frequently and by all effective modalities . " 
The report said the current surge was continuing in " every corner of the US , from small towns to large cities , from farms to beach communities . " 
It went on to lament that " many state and local governments are not implementing the same mitigation policies that stemmed the tide of the summer surge ; that must happen now . " 
It said mitigation efforts in Europe had resulted in " clear improvement " but warned " the majority of the United States is not mitigating similarly . "
