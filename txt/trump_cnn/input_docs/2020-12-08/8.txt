Michigan Gov . 
Gretchen Whitmer on Monday said it was " incredibly reckless " for Rudy Giuliani to attend a state legislative hearing last week without a mask . 
The state House committee hearing lasted more than four hours , where Giuliani pushed misleading claims that the presidential election was stolen from President Donald Trump . 
The President announced days later Giuliani had tested positive for Covid 19 . 
" We 've been telling the people of Michigan , the people of America , this virus is still very present . 
If you 're inside with people from outside your household , you 've got to be masked up , and you 've got to limit the amount of time that you are , and you certainly should not be unmasked at all , " Whitmer said . 
The governor called the hearing " unnecessary , " adding it was a " potentially spreading event that we may not see the ramifications from for another week or two . "
