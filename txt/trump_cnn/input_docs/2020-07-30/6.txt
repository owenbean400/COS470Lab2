President Trump said shutting down the economy " to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long term strategy for any country " as coronavirus continues to spread across the country . 
" The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions , " he said at a news briefing on Thursday . 
He said the purpose of the shutdown was to flatten the curve and to develop treatments and therapies . 
" We have done that , " Trump said , but warned the virus " can come rearing back when you least suspect it . " 
Trump said moving forward , it is important to protect elderly people and those with health conditions that put them at higher risk for complications . 
" You want to protect the elderly and socially distance . 
Wear a mask if you cannot socially distance and practice vigorous hygiene . 
Everyone – even healthy young people – should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease , " he said .
