Dr . Stephen Hahn , commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said Thursday that his agency " will not cut corners " when it comes to approving a Covid 19 vaccine . 
On Wednesday , an FDA official announced that the agency could issue an emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine in a matter of weeks -- once a vaccine meets efficacy requirements . 
Speaking on NBC ’s Today show on Thursday , Hahn said that even though things have been moving quickly on the vaccine development front , the FDA will focus on assisting developers and making sure a potential vaccine meets the safety and efficacy standards . 
Hahn said it 's possible that a vaccine could be ready for distribution by the end of the year . 
" Things have been moving very quickly . 
I know our team is looking at data in real time from these trials . 
And that should help us expedite this , " Hahn told NBC 's Savannah Guthrie . 
He said the decision on whether to take hydroxychloroquine , a drug that has been both promoted and taken by President Donald Trump , should be made between a patient and their doctor . 
When asked whether he was concerned about misinformation regarding the drug , Hahn said that " what I ’m concerned about is that FDA provide all the information about the side effects , the potential side effects , as well as the efficacy . "
