President Trump took the extraordinary step Thursday morning of openly suggesting in a tweet the possibility that the 2020 election , set for November 3 – 96 days from now – should be delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
Trump has previously sought to stoke fear and lay the groundwork to question the election ’s results by promoting the idea that mail in voting leads to widespread fraud and a " rigged " election . 
The tweet comes as a spate of recent polling in battleground states – and even states he won handily in 2016 – show him trailing or tied with former Vice President Joe Biden , and widespread disapproval of his handling of the pandemic . 
Asked about the issue in a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday , Attorney General William Barr said he had " no reason to think " that the upcoming election will be " rigged . " 
But he did say he believes that " if you have wholesale mail in voting , it substantially increases the risk of fraud . " 
But historically , voting by mail has not led to massive voter fraud . 
And nonpartisan election experts say the possibility of foreign entities printing millions of fraudulent mail in ballots this November is highly unlikely . 
A key point here : The President does not have the power to change the date of the election . 
Election Day is set by Congressional statute , and most experts agree that it cannot be changed without Congressional approval . 
Biden has previously raised the possibility of Trump attempting to delay the election . 
" Mark my words : I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow , come up with some rationale why it ca not be held , " Biden said at a virtual fundraiser in April , according to a pool report . 
Biden has maintained the November election should not be postponed and has previously made similar comments .
