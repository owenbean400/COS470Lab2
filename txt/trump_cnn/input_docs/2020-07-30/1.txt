Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers , said that the lack of a national plan around opening schools is making Americans " very scared " about the upcoming school year . 
" There 's national guidance about what can keep people safe , and frankly , if [ the teachers union ] could put it together in April , what has Betsy De Vos been doing ? " she said in an interview on CNN â€™s " New Day . " 
Education Secretary Betsy De Vos argued Wednesday against the need for a national plan on reopening schools . 
While Weingarten said school reopenings do need to be done on a regional level , the Trump administration has " been reckless and dangerous in saying fully reopen or else . " 
" What we need to do , like all of the other countries in the world have done , is that the government has to work together with people on the ground doing the essential work to make sure everyone is safe , " she said .
