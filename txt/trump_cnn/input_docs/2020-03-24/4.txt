US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this morning that " there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours , " as negotiations between congressional leaders and the Trump administration for a coronavirus stimulus package continue . 
" I think we ’re getting to a good place , if they stay there , " Pelosi said in an interview on CNBC . 
Pressure has been intensifying for days on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus package to respond to the economic fallout of the coronavirus , but Monday came and went without much action . 
Pelsoi said she believes the Senate bill will incorporate House Democrats ’ language on oversight for some of the funds in the package , and that the new version has also boosted resources for state and local governments . 
" We think the bill has moved sufficiently to the side of workers , " Pelosi added . 
She said congressional leaders " all appreciate the urgency . " 
Pelosi suggested she is hoping to avoid bringing the full House back to Washington to vote on the package , seeking to pass it through unanimous consent instead . 
What this means : Unanimous consent is commonly used for uncontroversial measures , not for packages of such magnitude as the coronavirus stimulus . 
In recent weeks , a group of members have pushed against the idea of returning to the Capitol , where they fear they will contribute to the spread of the virus . 
Any one member can block a unanimous consent request .
