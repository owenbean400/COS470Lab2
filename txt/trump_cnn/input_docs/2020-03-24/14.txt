President Trump said he wants the nation " opened up and just raring to go by Easter , " a date just over two weeks away that few health experts believe will be sufficient in containing the spread of coronavirus . 
Speaking during a Fox News town hall , Trump reiterated he was eager to see the nation return to normal , even as doctors warn the nation will see a massive spike in cases if Americans return to crowded workplaces or events . 
Despite announcing the new guidelines under the banner " The President 's Coronavirus Guidelines for America , " Trump seemed to distance himself from the practices during the town hall . 
" Somehow , the word got out that this is the thing we are supposed to be doing , " he said , noting the country had " never done a thing like this before . " 
" But we had to do it . 
It 's been very painful for our country and very destabilizing , " he said . 
As his advisers prepare options for returning the country to work , Trump suggested that Americans would still be able to exercise good health practices while still returning to normal . 
" We have to go back to work much sooner than people thought . 
People can go back to work and they can also pass it on my practice good judgment , " he said . 
Trump again compared coronavirus to the flu and auto accidents , despite warnings from his health advisers that such analogies make little sense . 
" We lose thousands and thousands of people to the flu . 
We do not turn the country off , " he said , adding : " We lose much more than that to automobile accidents . " 
Last week , Dr . Anthony Fauci said comparing coronavirus to auto accidents was a " false equivalency " and said it was important to " face the fact " that coronavirus is more lethal than the flu .
