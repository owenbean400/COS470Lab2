President Trump said that a " big part " of the stock market and the Dow ’s surge today was due to his work to get the country " open as soon possible " as well as the potential deal reached on the Hill . 
US stocks ended in the green on Tuesday , recouping all of Monday ’s losses as investors grew optimistic about the government ’s response to the coronavirus crisis . 
" The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America ’s economy , " Trump added . 
Trump also mistakenly claimed that today was the biggest one day gain for the Dow in history . 
In reality , it was the biggest one day gain for the Dow since 1933 .
