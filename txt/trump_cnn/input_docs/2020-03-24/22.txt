President Trump suggested Tuesday that his recent authorization of the Defense Production Act serves as enough " leverage " to compel companies to produce medical supplies without invoking the act to force them to start up production . 
Trump continued : " We did not have to exercise or utilize the DPA in any way . 
The fact that we have it helps but we did not have to and for the most part we wo not have to . " 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency describes the act as " the primary source of presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the US industrial base to support military , energy , space and homeland security programs . "
