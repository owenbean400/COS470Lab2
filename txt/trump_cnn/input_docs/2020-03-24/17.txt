Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he still hopes to reach a Senate deal on a coronavirus stimulus plan today . 
" I would just say we ’re trying to finalize all the documents . 
Going through a lot of complicated issues and we ’re making a lot of progress , " he said as he went from one meeting to another moments ago . " Again we ’re trying to get a deal as quick as we get a deal . 
So , I hope it ’s tonight . 
Absolutely . 
Still think we can get there , " he said when asked if there would be a deal tonight . 
Where things stand now : Pressure has been intensifying for days on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus package to respond to the economic fallout of the coronavirus , but yesterday came and went without much action . 
After four straight days of marathon negotiations , the Trump administration and senators again failed to secure an agreement on a roughly $ 2 trillion plan to provide a jolt to the economy and give aid to hard hit workers and industries . 
Leaders emerged from late night meetings in the Capitol optimistic that a deal could be struck today .
