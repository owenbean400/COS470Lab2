Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed what other negotiators are saying Tuesday morning , signaling that he expects a deal soon — later today . 
He said that he had " just finished a very productive meeting " with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , White House congressional liaison Eric Ueland and President Trump ’s acting chief of staff Mark Meadows . 
" Last night I thought we were on the 5 yard line , right now we ’re on the 2 . 
As I also said last night , at this point , of the few outstanding issues , I do not see any that ca not be overcome within the next few hours , " Schumer said . 
He continued : " We are very , very pleased with what seems to be moving forward in the bill – in the bipartisan bill – that we hope will be brought to the floor . " 
Schumer also said that the legislation will have " unemployment insurance on steroids . " 
" This is a great plan . 
What it says is if you lose your job in this crisis you can be furloughed by your employer . 
That means you stay on that employers work list , if you have health benefits with the employer you can keep getting them , but most importantly the federal government will pay your salary – your full salary – for now four months . 
We had asked for four months and four months looks like what we ’re going to get when we come to this agreement , " he said .
