President Trump just tweeted that " Congress must approve " a stimulus deal , " without all of the nonsense . " 
" The longer it takes , the harder it will be to start up our economy , " Trump wrote . 
" Our workers will be hurt ! " 
Where things stand now : Pressure has been intensifying for days on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus package to respond to the economic fallout of the coronavirus , but Monday came and went without much action . 
After four straight days of marathon negotiations , the Trump administration and senators again failed to secure an agreement on a roughly $ 2 trillion plan to provide a jolt to the economy and give aid to hard hit workers and industries . 
But leaders emerged from late night meetings in the Capitol optimistic that a deal could be struck today despite tweets from President Trump trashing the deal and baselessly accusing Democrats of siding with " the virus . "
