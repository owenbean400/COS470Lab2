Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said President Trump should " stop talking and start listening to the medical experts . " 
Earlier today , Trump said he wants the nation " opened up and just raring to go by Easter " â€” a date just more than two weeks away that few health experts believe will be sufficient in containing the spread of coronavirus . 
" Look , we all want the economy to open as rapidly as possible . 
The way to do that is let 's take care of the medical side of this immediately , " Biden said . 
Biden said Trump is " not responsible for the coronavirus " but added the President is " responsible for the delay in taking the actions that need to be taken . "
