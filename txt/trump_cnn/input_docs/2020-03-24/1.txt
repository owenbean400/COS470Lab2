The Federal Emergency Management Agency ’s administrator Peter Gaynor says his team told him they are going to use the Defense Production Act for the first time today . 
Gaynor says FEMA will use it today for about 60,000 test kits . 
" There ’s some test kits we need to get our hands on , " he said on CNN this morning . 
" We ’re going to insert some language into these mass contracts that we have for the 500 million masks . [ Defense Production Act ] language will be in that today . " 
What this is about : President Trump said he would invoke the act , which grants him authority to direct private companies to ramp up production of needed medical supplies to fight the coronavirus pandemic in the US . 
The law , passed in 1950 as a response to the Korean War , gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production . 
Shortly after Trump announced he would be invoking the Defense Production Act , the White House received pushback from business leaders , who expressed concern that the act could cause major unforeseen problems , including profit loss .
