Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was spotted heading into Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell 's office today . 
He said he 's in contact Rep . 
Mark Meadows , who is Trump 's incoming chief of staff , and he 's " looking forward " to getting a coronavirus stimulus deal done today . 
Where things stand now : Pressure has been intensifying for days on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus package to respond to the economic fallout of the coronavirus , but Monday came and went without much action . 
After four straight days of marathon negotiations , the Trump administration and senators again failed to secure an agreement on a roughly $ 2 trillion plan to provide a jolt to the economy and give aid to hard hit workers and industries . 
But leaders emerged from late night meetings in the Capitol optimistic that a deal could be struck today despite tweets from President Trump trashing the deal and baselessly accusing Democrats of siding with " the virus . "
