President Trump said during Tuesday ’s virtual town hall on Fox News that he " canceled " a stimulus deal with Democrats last night . 
" I canceled the deal last night . 
I said I ’m not going to sign that deal because ( House Speaker ) Nancy Pelosi came in and put a lot of things in the deal that had nothing to do with the workers , that had to do with an agenda that they ’ve been trying to get passed for 10 years , " Trump said in the Rose Garden of the White House . 
" I told … a lot of people there ’s no way I ’m signing that deal . " 
The President said Republican Sens . 
John Kennedy , Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham also spoke to him to advise him not to get onboard with the deal . 
" All of the sudden they start throwing all of the little Green New Deal stuff in , " Trump said of Democrats ’ additions to the stimulus proposal . 
He said they wanted assurances on what board rooms would look like , on green energy , windmills and oil . 
More context : After another marathon day of negotiations , Congress failed to make a deal Monday to pass a massive stimulus package to respond to the economic fallout of the coronavirus . 
But leaders emerged from late night meetings in the Capitol optimistic that a deal could be struck Tuesday despite tweets from Trump trashing the deal and baselessly accusing Democrats of siding with " the virus . " 
Throughout the day today , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — including Senate leadership — have said that they are close on making a deal .
