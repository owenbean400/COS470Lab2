President Trump said Tuesday that he still has a good relationship with Dr . Anthony Fauci , the coronavirus task force member who leads the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases . 
" I think it ’s very good , " he said of his relationship with Fauci . 
" You would have heard about it if it was not . " 
Asked why Fauci was not at the town hall today , Trump said , " You know , they have other things to do . 
And yesterday we were not really talking about what he ’s an expert on . 
We were talking about other things . " 
The President complained that when a task force member is not seen at a briefing or meeting , the press is quick to ask why they are not there . 
" I respect all of these people . 
These are great people , " Trump said . 
He called Dr . Deborah Birx and Fauci " extraordinary . " 
Earlier in the town hall , Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams asserted that the President listens to his health experts , including Fauci , about the coronavirus .
