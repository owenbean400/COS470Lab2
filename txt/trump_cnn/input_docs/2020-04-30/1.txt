The Trump administration 's program to accelerate the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine , called " Operation Warp Speed , " has the goal to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses by January -- which is in the realm of possibility , according to the nation 's top infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci . 
In a Thursday morning appearance on the Today Show , Fauci said that he is part of the team involved in that project . 
Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , previously has said that a coronavirus vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop . 
The United States currently has the timeline of developing its vaccine by the end of the year . 
" Remember go back in time , I was saying in January and February that it would be a year to 18 months , " Fauci said . 
" January is a year -- so it is not that much from what I had originally said . "
