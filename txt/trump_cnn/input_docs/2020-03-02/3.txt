Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor today to rail against President Trump , saying President Trump is downplaying the virus to a " dangerous degree . " 
Schumer also said that the Trump administration needs to take three steps : issue " coherent guidance " on how school districts should respond if a virus is detected in the community ; issue a " uniform " screening policy for airports and ports of entry ; and allow federal scientists and medical experts to speak freely . 
Schumer also reiterated that the emerging spending deal must prohibit the administration from spending the funds on anything other than the coronavirus . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell said today the Senate must quickly pass a coronavirus supplemental and warned Democrats against " moving the goalposts " or interfering in the ongoing positive negotiations between appropriators .
