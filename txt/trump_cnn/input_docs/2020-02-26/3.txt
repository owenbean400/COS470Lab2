The White House and Senate Democrats are at least $ 6 billion apart when it comes to determining how much funding the federal government needs to combat the coronavirus epidemic . 
Soon after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed an $ 8.5 billion package , a senior Trump administration official told CNN that the administration is " very confident " that its request for $ 1.25 billion in new emergency funds as part of a $ 2.5 billion total package will be sufficient to fund the US 's coronavirus response . 
The official rejected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer 's $ 8.5 billion counter and punched back at Democrats who are calling for significantly higher funding levels to respond to coronavirus . 
The official said the administration 's request " was carefully developed based on current and expected expenditures and will fully fund our robust all of government response to coronavirus . 
We ’ll continue working with Congress to get this done . " 
Remember : It 's not just Democrats who are saying the Trump administration 's funding request is insufficient . 
Even Republican Sen . 
Richard Shelby , the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee , said Tuesday that he worried that administration was " lowballing " the request . 
And it 's possible that pressure will soon come to bear on the administration . 
Capitol Hill sources told CNN that the Trump administration has already indicated that they know they will need more money down the line than initially requested . 
One Republican Senate aide said that while it is true the administration can ask for money whenever they want , the official said it was a strategic mistake for the Trump administration to not ask for a number closer to the Obama administration ’s Ebola funding request .
