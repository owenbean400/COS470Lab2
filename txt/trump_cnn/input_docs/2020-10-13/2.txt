White House physician Sean Conley said Monday President Donald Trump has tested negative for Covid 19 on consecutive days , as the President heads to a crowded campaign rally in Florida . 
That additional data , Conley said , included " viral load , subgenomic RNA and PCR cycle threshold measurements , as well as ongoing assessment of viral culture data . " 
PCR suggests a polymerase chain reaction test , which looks for any evidence of the virus , although Conley did not say clearly what type of test was run .

Trump , who first announced he tested positive on Thursday , October 1 , is more than 10 days out , and the US Food and Drug Administration has said it does not know how accurate the test is at that point . 
The White House still has not revealed the last time Trump tested negative prior to his positive diagnosis , offering varying justifications for withholding that information . 
Trump is " not infectious to others , " Conley added .
