Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , in a statement Tuesday , announced Senate Republicans will attempt to move forward on a targeted bill to restart the small business loan program that served as a centerpiece of the coronavirus relief efforts when the Senate returns to session next week . 
The effort is likely to be blocked – Democratic leaders have repeatedly rejected piecemeal approaches to the next relief effort , including a roughly $ 300 billion Senate GOP relief bill , which Democrats voted unanimously against last month . 
Instead , they have insisted on a broad , comprehensive response to the twin economic and public health issues facing the country . 
Those negotiations , however , have remained at a stalemate for months . 
While President Donald Trump offered a momentary boost to the prospects of an agreement last week when he called for a " big " deal and proposed a $ 1.8 trillion offer , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has rejected the effort and the talks are once again stuck without a clear path forward . 
Pelosi , in a letter to her House Democratic colleagues Tuesday , listed off a myriad of significant issues with the latest Trump administration proposal . 
" Significant changes must be made to remedy the Trump proposal ’s deficiencies , " Pelosi wrote to her colleagues . 
The Senate GOP move , which aides have said was under discussion for several days , follows a request to lawmakers from Treasury Sec . 
Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to pass a bill restarting the small business loan program , known as the Paycheck Protection Program . 
The program came to an end with roughly $ 130 billion in funds unspent .
