Drugmaker Eli Lilly said Tuesday it was pausing its trial of a combination antibody treatment for coronavirus for safety reasons . 
Usually , clinical trials are paused because a volunteer has suffered a side effect or become ill , but the company did not say what happened . 
" Safety is of the upmost importance to Lilly , " a spokesperson told CNN by email . 
It said the trial ’s Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , an independent group of medical experts who monitor clinical trials , had recommended the pause . 
" The trial , evaluating Lilly ’s investigational neutralizing antibody as a treatment for COVID 19 in hospitalized patients , is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . 
Lilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study , " the company said in the statement . 
Lilly is testing a combination of two lab engineered immune system proteins called monoclonal antibodies to treat severely ill patients with coronavirus . 
It is similar to the treatment made by Regeneron that was given to President Trump earlier this month . 
The news comes after drugmaker Johnson & Johnson announced that it learned of an " unexplained illness " in one of the volunteers which caused it to pause its Phase 3 coronavirus vaccine trial in the US on Sunday , and immediately informed the DSMB , which monitors clinical trial developments . 
The drugmaker said it did not know whether the volunteer who became ill had received the vaccine or placebo .
