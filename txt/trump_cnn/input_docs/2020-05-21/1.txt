If the United States had implemented social distancing policies just a week sooner , it could have prevented more than half the number of coronavirus deaths and infections , according to new research from Columbia University . 
And if the country had locked down two weeks earlier than it did , it could have prevented 84 % of deaths and 82 % of cases , said the the research team , led by epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman . 
Their findings have not been reviewed by other experts for accuracy . 
The US timeline : The first US case was reported at the end of January . 
It was not until mid March that the Trump administration urged Americans to avoid groups and limit travel . 
That ’s also when cities like New York started to close schools . 
The study used epidemiologic modeling to gauge transmission rates from March 15 to May 3 and determine the impact social distancing could have . 
The first days were crucial . 
" During the initial growth of a pandemic , infections increase exponentially . 
As a consequence , early intervention and fast response are critical , " the researchers wrote . 
But they admitted it ’s also true that they could not account for how people would have responded to earlier policies . 
" Public compliance with social distancing rules may also lag due to sub optimal awareness of infection risk , " they said . 
All 50 states are now in some stage of reopening . 
If local leaders detect a growth in new cases , they should respond quickly , the Columbia team said -- a longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death .
