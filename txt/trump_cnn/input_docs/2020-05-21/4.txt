A shipment of 50 ventilators , the first part of a US humanitarian aid delivery meant to help Russia fight coronavirus , has landed in the Russian capital , the US Embassy in Moscow said in a statement Thursday . 
The donation marks the " rapid " fulfillment " of an offer made by President Trump in response to President Putin â€™s request for assistance , " the statement read . 
In early April , Russia sent a cargo plane with medical supplies and ventilators to be deployed in New York and New Jersey . 
The model of Russian made ventilators , Aventa M , has been since suspended for use in Russia following two fires in hospitals treating coronavirus patients . 
A Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson told CNN at the time the ventilators had never been deployed and the shipment was returned by New York and New Jersey .
