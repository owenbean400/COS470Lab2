Stacey Nagy , a Texas woman who lost her husband David to the coronavirus , called out the President and state governor Greg Abbott in no uncertain terms in his obituary . 
" Family members believe David 's death was needless , " the obituary read . 
" They blame his death and the deaths of all the other innocent people , on Trump , Abbott , and all the other politicians who did not take this pandemic seriously and were more concerned with their popularity and votes than lives . " 
Nagy told CNN on Tuesday night that she initially hoped putting her husband ’s obituary in their local newspaper might spur members of her community to respect the seriousness of the pandemic , and was surprised when her words spread nationwide online . 
" I posted it in my little town ’s little newspaper , and hoped that a few of the residents would read it and start wearing masks , and I had no idea that it would have turned out the way it did , " she said . 
Loving husband : Nagy told CNN how her husband lived , in addition to the manner in which he died . 
" Dave was a character , he was a fun loving person , and he loved his family dearly , " Nagy said . 
" You know , I could be in the kitchen washing dishes at the sink and he would come up and start kissing the back of neck , giving me chills in the back of my neck , and he was the love of my life , and I love him . 
He was a part of me , and I feel lost without him . "
