President Trump reiterated on Wednesday that he may use executive authority to implement a payroll tax cut . 
The President then went on to say that the leaders of Democratic states do not want their states to reopen . 
" The Democrats are standing in our way . 
They do not want their states open , even if their state â€™s in good shape , " the President said . 
Some context : Trump has been pushing Congress to include a payroll tax cut in the next economic relief package . 
Payroll tax cuts have had mixed results in the past , and some economists argue that it 's not the best way to boost the economy right now . 
A payroll tax cut would reduce the amount taken out of workers ' paychecks to fund federal programs including Social Security and Medicare . 
Congress would have to decide how much to reduce the rate and how long the tax holiday would last .
