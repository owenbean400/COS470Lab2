There are two days before the US government releases its July jobs report , but President Trump is already talking it up . 
Trump has spoken about previous monthly jobs reports in similarly vague terms before their release , breaking with years of presidential protocol . 
In the " last two months we set a record on the job numbers . 
Now we will have another big job number on Friday , so it will be interesting to see what that is , " he said in the interview . 
Some context : Economists expect 1.6 million jobs were added to the US economy in July , markedly fewer than the 4.8 million added in June , which set a record for most new jobs in one month . 
But even if the July predictions hold true , the US economy will still be down some 13 million jobs since February . 
The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.5 % in July , still above the Great Recession peak .
