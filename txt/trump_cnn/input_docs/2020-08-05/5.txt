Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba of Jackson , Mississippi , said he is worried that the state has " yet to see the worst " of the coronavirus pandemic as cases continue to grow . 
He said that the city ’s hospitals and intensive care units are " overwhelmed " and asked for temporary hospitals to be set up during a recent meeting with the governor and Dr . Deborah Birx , a key member of the White House coronavirus task force . 
Mississippi Gov . 
Tate Reeves just implemented a two week temporary statewide mask mandate , which Lumumba calls " necessary . " 
" I think that we failed to operate with a sense of urgency . 
We issued a … mandatory facial covering mandate in the city of Jackson nearly a month ago , " Lumumba said . 
" . . . We warned that we were opening up too soon and that communities were having their hand forced to do so . 
And so I think we 're seeing the ill effects of that decision , " he said . 
Lumumba also spoke out against President Trump saying in an interview " it is what it is " when asked about the coronavirus death toll . 
" It ’s simply not OK just to say that people will die , knowing that we have not put our best effort forward , " the mayor said .
