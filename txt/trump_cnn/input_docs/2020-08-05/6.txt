President Trump argued on Wednesday that children should return to US schools because they ’re " almost " or " virtually immune " from the coronavirus . 
Even though children are less susceptible to the virus , they can still transmit it to others in their household or within their communities . 
Trump said he would get media criticism for using the term " totally immune , " adding , " but the fact is that they are virtually immune from this problem . " 
The President also brought up that only one minor had died from coronavirus in the state of New Jersey and that he suspected the child was diabetic . 
He also suggested that children under the diabetic child ’s age were also even more immune . 
Remember : But at least two children have died from coronavirus in New Jersey and both were under the age of five . 
The President also said older teachers should wait out the pandemic before returning to work in classrooms . 
Last month , Trump asserted that children do not catch or spread the coronavirus easily and that he ’s comfortable with his children and grandchildren returning to school . 
What we know about kids and coronavirus : CNN previously reported that researchers in South Korea have found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can transmit Covid 19 within a household just as much as adults , according to research published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal Emerging Infectious Diseases . 
They also found that children ages 9 and under transmitted the virus within their household at rates that were a lot lower . 
US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CBS News last month that though the risk to children getting coronavirus is low , they can still transmit it to others . 
" We know the risk is low to the actual students . 
But we know they can transmit to others . 
… We need to take measures to make sure we protect those who are vulnerable either because they are older or they have chronic medical conditions , " Adams said .
