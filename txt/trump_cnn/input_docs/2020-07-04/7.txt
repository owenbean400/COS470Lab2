About the event : President Trump spoke at the event , mentioning the virus just once , at the very top of his remarks , thanking those working to fight it . 
Attendees clustered together in stadium seating in front of a patriotic themed stage for hours before Trump arrived , and people at the top of the amphitheater sat in rows of folding chairs that were tied together with zip ties â€” preventing any social distancing .
