President Trump this morning signed an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program into law , according to the White House . 
The House unanimously passed the extension less than a day after the program shuttered , and PPP will now remain open to applications through August 8 . 
About the program : Congress created the program to help small businesses keep employees on their payrolls amid nationwide closures . 
The program was designed to offer small business loans to bridge the shutdowns and help businesses keep employees in their jobs â€” and in turn , the loans taken out would be forgiven , essentially shifting into a grant . 
More than 4.8 million small business owners have utilized the program , which was designed as a bridge for companies to maintain their payrolls through the worst of the pandemic .
