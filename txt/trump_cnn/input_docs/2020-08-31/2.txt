During a news conference with other community leaders on Monday , New York State Senator Brad Hoylman and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried called for the passage of their two bills that would allow the state board of elections to introduce mail in ballot drop boxes amid the pandemic and ongoing postal service delays . 
" Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , Donald Trump has tried for years to undermine our elections with false claims about voter fraud , " he continued . 
Hoylman pushed for the state to pass the bills as soon as possible to avoid the same fate of New York ’s June primary , pointing to the more than 84,000 absentee ballots that were invalidated in New York City . 
They accounted for 21 % of the all ballots received by the city ’s board of elections , said the senator . 
He called on the legislature to either convene to pass the bill , or have Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo authorize the ballot drop boxes via executive order . 
On Aug . 20 , Gov . 
Cuomo signed a package of election reforms that would allow voters to both request an absentee ballot due to Covid 19 and have ballots postmarked on election day be counted by the state board of elections . 
So far , 33 states along with Washington , DC , have authorized the use of ballot drop boxes , said Hoylman . 
The ballot box prototype unveiled Monday would be monitored by either local law enforcement or election officials and would include a tamper proof seal , he explained . 
Each one would cost around $ 6,000 and serve every 15 to 20 thousand registered voters , said Hoylman , which would amount to 650-865 boxes in NY for a total cost of four to five million dollars . 
The boxes could be placed in high traffic areas including libraries , schools , and possibly even near ATM machines , he said . 
" What is the cost in not assuring voters that their ballot is going to be counted in November , " he asked . 
According to the state senate and assembly websites , both bills are still in committee .
