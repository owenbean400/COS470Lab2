It is " irresponsible " for President Trump to suggest a Covid 19 vaccine will be developed by Election Day , according to Rick Bright , the ousted director of the office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine . 
Bright said that " scientists are working at breakneck speeds " on a vaccine . 
" It is unprecedented to see how fast they are moving through a lot the steps . 
The one step you cannot rush is the safety evaluation of that vaccine after it 's put into people . 
It takes time , " Bright said . 
The US Food and Drug Administration said it will want to see two months of follow up data after volunteers get their second vaccine doses for clinical trials . 
That would make it nearly impossible for any vaccine maker to apply for emergency use authorization by Nov . 3 .
