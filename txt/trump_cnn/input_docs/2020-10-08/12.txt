Rick Bright , the ousted director of the office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine , said President Trump ’s message to not be afraid of coronavirus is " reckless and deadly . " 
Bright resigned from his post at the National Institutes of Health this week . 
He was ousted from his role leading the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and reassigned to a narrower role at NIH . 
He filed a whistleblower complaint this spring alleging that his early warnings about coronavirus were ignored and that his caution at hydroxychloroquine led to his removal . 
" [ Trump ] has never told us the truth about the risk or the seriousness of this outbreak . 
He has not told the truth about his status , when he was infected . 
… By lying to the American public and not telling us the full truth , you ’re actually prolonging the duration and impact of this pandemic . 
You ’re actually allowing more people to die , " he said . 
Bright said he is speaking out because he thinks scientists are being pushed to the sidelines . 
" More people are going to die because scientists are being pushed back . 
… The world needs to know the truth . 
And if we continue to hide the truth , then we 're going to see many more deaths that do not need to occur , " Bright said .
