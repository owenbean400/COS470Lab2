Regeneron says it has applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for its experimental monoclonal antibody therapy , the same antibody cocktail given to President Donald Trump Friday after he was diagnosed with coronavirus . 
The biotechnology company confirmed it had submitted the EUA application in a statement on its website Wednesday night . 
Regeneron 's experimental antibody treatment is still in large scale clinical trials , but has been available for compassionate use , something the FDA has to approve on an individual basis , like it did for Trump . 
Some early data from trials of the antibody treatment released last week showed it worked fairly safely with few side effects . 
" This class of drugs is an extremely safe class , " Schleifer said .
