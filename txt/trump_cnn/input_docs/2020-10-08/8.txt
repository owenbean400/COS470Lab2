US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Operation Warp Speed has applied " the same methods " to therapeutics as it has to support vaccines and there could be " tens or hundreds of thousands of doses " of Regeneron 's antibody cocktail available soon . 
" OWS supported clinical trials continue for remdesivir in combination with other drugs . 
In addition to anticoagulants and other options , " Azar said . 
" We 're also supporting several randomized controlled clinical trials to produce more data on convalescent plasma , " he added , noting " to which Americans have enjoyed broader access than anywhere else on Earth . " 
Some background : Regeneron 's experimental antibody treatment is still in large scale clinical trials , but has been available for compassionate use , something the FDA has to approve on an individual basis , like it did for President Trump . 
The antibody therapy is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies that is designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS Co V 2 , the virus that causes Covid 19 , according to the company 's statement . 
A cocktail antibody therapy uses two or more lab engineered antibodies . 
Regeneron 's cocktail includes a monoclonal antibody that targets the spike protein the virus uses to drill into healthy cells , and another antibody that targets a different part of the novel coronavirus . 
With two , the hope is to trap and shut down viral replication .
