In a dire new warning , Amtrak says without $ 5 billion in pandemic stimulus funds from Congress , it will shed 2,400 workers , cut the frequency of trains on some routes , and stop major improvement projects . 
Some context : On Tuesday , President Trump shut the door on House Democrats ’ updated Heroes Act , which included $ 2.4 billion for Amtrak . 
" While we were grateful for this sign of support , at this time , there is no clear path to finalize such supplemental funding in Congress and the Administration , " said Flynn . 
" Amtrak is in a very precarious position as we await final decisions on our funding levels . " 
Amtrak ’s president said if current funding levels are carried over into the rail system ’s next fiscal year , " we will be unable to avoid more drastic impacts that could have long lasting effects on our Northeast Corridor infrastructure and the national rail system . "
