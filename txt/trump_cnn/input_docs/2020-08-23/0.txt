President Trump will hold a news conference at 6 p.m . ET Sunday to discuss " a major therapeutic breakthrough " regarding coronoavirus , White House Press Secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany announced . 
She said Alex Azar , Secretary for US Health and Human Services , Stephan Hahn , the head of the Food and Drug Administration , would be in attendance . 
On Saturday , President Donald Trump accused the US Food and Drug Administration of deliberately delaying coronavirus vaccine trials without providing any evidence . 
" The deep state , or whoever , over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics , " Trump tweeted , continuing to push his unfounded theory that there is a " deep state " embedded within the government bureaucracy working against his reelection . 
He accused the agency of delaying a vaccine for the virus until after the fall election , tweeting : " Obviously , they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd . 
Must focus on speed , and saving lives ! " 
Trump ended his tweet by tagging the Twitter account of Hahn , who he nominated last year to take up the role . 
Hahn assured Americans earlier this month that the agency " will not cut corners " to approve a vaccine .
