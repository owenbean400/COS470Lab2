President Donald Trump told reporters Sunday he believed " political reasons " created a slowdown of approval for a coronavirus treatment at the Food and Drug Administration -- but said he " broke the logjam " over the last week . 
Trump 's remarks amount to tacit confirmation that he applied pressure on the agency ahead of its announcement Sunday that it was issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to treat Covid 19 . 
He said he believed there were officials at the FDA and in the Department of Health and Human Services " that can see things being held up and would not mind so much . " 
Trump insisted his focus on treatments for coronavirus -- which has slowed the American economy and caused his poll numbers to sink -- was apolitical . 
Earlier in the briefing , Trump seemed enthusiastic when asked by a reporter from Fox News whether patients should have access to treatments or vaccines before they reach the end of trials . 
" We have all of these great , seemingly great answers that are ready to come out , but because of the process it takes -- can we use some of this early under right to try ? " he asked , referring to legislation that allows patients access to drugs that are still in the investigational phase . 
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn declined to answer when asked by Jim Acosta as the briefing concluded whether there was pressure on him to approve the emergency use of convalescent plasma .
