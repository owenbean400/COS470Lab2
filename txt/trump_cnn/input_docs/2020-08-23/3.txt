House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Sunday that her caucus is standing together in its approach to negotiating another round of coronavirus relief legislation with the Trump administration . 
This follows after almost half of House Democrats signed a letter last week calling on Pelosi to pass a stand alone unemployment insurance bill and restart talks with the White House to find bipartisan solutions to pass another coronavirus stimulus bill . 
Pelosi criticized the Trump administration 's stance against providing additional funds for state and local government . 
The White House has firmly opposed including $ 1 trillion in state and local aid which Democrats said must be part of a new stimulus bill . 
" What they say to us is why should one state help another state that may have needs ? 
Well , we welcome them to the United States of America , " the speaker said .
