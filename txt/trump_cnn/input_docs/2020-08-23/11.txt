The US Food and Drug Administration on Sunday issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma for the treatment of Covid 19 in hospitalized patients . 
The agency said it concluded that the product may be effective in treating Covid 19 and that " the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . " 
President Donald Trump is expected to discuss the announcement during a Sunday media briefing . 
Convalescent plasma is created from the blood of people who have recovered from Covid 19 , and it has shown some success in two other deadly coronaviruses : MERS and SARS . 
It has also been used to treat flu and Ebola . 
Emergency use authorization from the FDA does not require the same level of evidence as full FDA approval . 
At the end of March , the FDA created a pathway for scientists to try convalescent plasma with patients and study its impact . 
Physicians have been using the treatment since . 
So far , more than 60,000 people in the United States have been treated with convalescent plasma .
