President Trump would be willing to sign a bill that included Postal Service funding and reform – but only if Democrats agreed to include other economic relief measures along with it , White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Sunday . 
Meadows said he planned to call Pelosi later on Sunday and noted he met with a number of congressional Democrats on Capitol Hill on Saturday . 
Meadows told reporters he had tried to see the speaker , but she was in a meeting and so he left a note . 
There was no meeting on the books , CNN reported , so there was no expectation of them seeing each other . 
More context : Lawmakers had returned to the Hill for a rare Saturday vote on a bill that provided $ 25 billion for the US Postal Service , as well as a pause on cost cutting measures by the USPS Democrats charged would hamper delivery of mailed ballots in the fall . 
Meadows called the legislation , which passed the House 257-150 yesterday , a " largely messaging bill " that Pelosi knew had no chance of becoming law . 
" It has everything to do with a political statement , " Meadows said on Fox News . 
" Here 's how I know . 
Because in the privacy of the negotiating room , I offered $ 10 billion plus reforms for the Postal Service that actually they 've been asking for for a long time , to Speaker Pelosi and Chuck Schumer . " 
Trump ’s chief of staff also criticized Pelosi for previously rejecting the idea of passing individual bills to deal with aspects of economic relief that the two sides could potentially agree on – such as enhanced unemployment benefits and support for small businesses – but then embracing a standalone bill for the Postal Service . 
He criticized her for bringing the House back on a Saturday to vote on a mail bill , but not for relief funds . 
" Why did not she come in and do enhanced unemployment ? " 
Meadows said on Fox . 
" Why did not she come in and do money for education and daycare ? " 
CNN has reached out to Pelosi ’s office for comment .
