The White House may have bullied the US Food and Drug Administration into giving emergency use authorization to using blood plasma from coronavirus survivors as a treatment for new patients , a prominent vaccine expert said Sunday . 
Moving things along quickly is fine , Offit told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , but it 's the FDA 's job to hold products to a standard of safety and efficacy . 
Offit said he worries that the FDA , like other science based agencies " get bullied to do what Donald Trump wants them to do , and I think it 's a dangerous game he plays . " 
The potential side effects of convalescent plasma are not known , Offit said . 
While he said he thinks it is likely that it is generally a safe product , " until something has been shown clearly to work , we should not put it out there . " 
It makes sense that administering a serum with high levels of neutralizing antibodies to a person who is mildly ill would help , but " the trick is proving that it makes a difference , " Offit said minutes after the White House announcement about the EUA . 
The data so far have not proved that the plasma makes a difference , said Offit , which is why the FDA was " loath " to approve the treatment . 
In making the announcement , the FDA and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar cited data from a study posted online to a pre print server , meaning it had not been peer reviewed , on August 12 . 
Offit questioned whether there was newer data that the FDA had not shared . 
Offit said that what worries him the most is the repercussions this could have on vaccines .
