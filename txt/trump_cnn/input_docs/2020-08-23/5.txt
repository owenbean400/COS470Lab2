Tonight â€™s White House press conference is expected to be about an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) for a convalescent plasma to treat Covid 19 , according to two sources with knowledge of the situation . 
Last week , President Trump accused some health officials of playing politics regarding the EUA for convalescent plasma . 
When asked about the US Food and Drug Administration not having granted a EUA , Trump said it was political . 
Today , one of the sources who is close to the White House Coronavirus Task Force , said the FDA has reviewed additional data to inform its impending EUA decision . 
This official has not personally reviewed the data . 
The source said the FDA is under no obligation to consult anyone outside the agency about its decision . 
The science : Convalescent plasma is created from the blood of people who have recovered from Covid 19 , and it has shown success in two other deadly coronaviruses : MERS and SARS . 
It has also been used to treat the flu and Ebola . 
Emergency use authorization from the FDA does not require the same level of evidence as full FDA approval . 
At the end of March , the FDA created a pathway for scientists to try convalescent plasma with patients and study its impact . 
Physicians have been using the treatment since . 
So far , more than 60,000 people in the United States have been treated with convalescent plasma .
