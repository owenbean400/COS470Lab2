Bernie Sanders called on President Trump to sign the Covid 19 relief bill passed by Congress " right now " and implored the President to push for additional $ 2,000 payments to individuals after signing the bill . 
Sanders had been among the loudest voices pushing for $ 2,000 payments to people to be included in the $ 900 billion bill that only included $ 600 payments , which Sanders called " simply not enough . " 
Sanders also criticized President Trump for being absent during negotiations for the bill that now sits on his desk . 
" Not a word , " Sanders said when asked if he â€™d heard from Trump during the negotiations of the bill . 
" Everybody assumed that Mnuchin was representing the White House . " 
Sanders also commented that he suspects President elect Joe Biden will make it a priority to provide further assistance to people once he takes office .
