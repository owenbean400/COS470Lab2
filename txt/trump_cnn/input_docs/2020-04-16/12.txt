During his announcement about new guidelines from the federal government , President Trump made a complete reversal in course from remarks earlier this week where he suggested he had " absolute authority " to reopen the country . 
Trump suggested Thursday that governors will be empowered to make the decisions regarding stay at home orders and will be supported by the federal government . 
" Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states , every state is very different . 
They ’re all beautiful , we love them all , but they ’re very , very different . 
They need to remain closed , we will allow them to do that . 
And if they believe it is time to reopen , we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task and very , very quickly , depending on what they want to do , " Trump said at the coronavirus task force press briefing . 
He continued : " We are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts . 
We ’ll have numerous cases where states have worked , and will be working , very , very closely together . " 
CNN reported details of the proposal earlier Thursday .
