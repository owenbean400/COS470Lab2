The union representing Federal Emergency Management Agency employees is joining growing calls for the Trump administration to utilize the full authorities provided by the Defense Production Act to shore up more protective equipment to fight Covid 19 , according to a letter obtained by CNN . 
The wartime era law , which gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production , has been a point of contention between states and the Trump administration . 
Some context : While President Trump has invoked the law in some instances during the coronavirus pandemic , the shortage of critically needed supplies has fueled calls to use the law in its full capacity . 
The letter is the first time FEMA 's union , which represents 3,000 employees , has joined that push . 
" We will not flatten the curve unless every front line worker in the public and private sector who has a job where telework is not available has access to appropriate personal protective equipment , " said the letter , written by Steven Reaves , president of FEMA 's union . 
The letter is expected to be sent to lawmakers later Thursday .
