Today on a call with the nation 's governors about reopening the economy after the coronavirus , several governors pressed President Trump over lack of testing . 
According a source familiar , the administration focused on the two main private sector firms , Quest and Labcorp , saying both of them still had capacity to conduct more tests . 
But , as this source notes , this does not address one of the biggest problems many states face , not just a lack of tests , but lack of materials needed for the testing , such as swabs . 
During the call , the White House insisted that they had shipments of the swabs getting ready to go out , which should make the testing easier . 
However , the source pointed out that the administration has been promising this for more than a month . 
The other problem with private testing is that it still takes multiple days to get the results . 
At one point , the administration also said that not all states were using their public state labs to their capacity .
