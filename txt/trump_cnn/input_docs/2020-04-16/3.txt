Nearly a dozen African American pastors from Philadelphia to Los Angeles issued a " moral appeal " to the Trump administration over the " alarming number of deaths " in black communities from Covid 19 . 
Testing , treatment , and protective gear must be equally distributed and readily available to black and poor communities , and to essential wage workers , healthcare workers , prisons , and shelters , the pastors said at a virtual news conference Wednesday . 
Rev . 
Traci Blackmon , who pastors a church in St . Louis , became emotional as she spoke about the suffering she is seeing among her congregants . 
Three of those five had to go to the hospital three times before they were given a test , Blackmon said . 
Early data from some areas show African Americans make up a higher percentage of Covid 19 victims . 
In Chicago , 62 % of the people who have died from Covid 19 are black , though they make up 30 % of the population , according to data from the city . 
In Louisiana , 32 % of the population is African American , but that population represents about 59 % of coronavirus deaths in the state .
