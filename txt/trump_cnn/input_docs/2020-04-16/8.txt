In his call with senators on Thursday , President Trump heard a similar message he received a day earlier from business leaders : the country needs to dramatically increase its testing capabilities before states can reopen . 
In the phone call with Democratic and Republican senators , Trump was told by some lawmakers that without the increased testing , asymptomatic people may return to workplaces and unknowingly spread the virus , creating further contagion , according to people familiar with the call . 
Trump countered by saying his administration had worked to scale up testing and repeated his dubious claim that the United States had tested more people than any other country . 
He also pointed to a new test that people could administer themselves that uses saliva , a person familiar with the conversation said . 
As he did on Wednesday during his briefing , Trump told senators that individual states — and not the federal government — should be responsible for testing , but that the administration would support governors in their efforts to scale up tests .
