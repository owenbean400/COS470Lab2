Connecticut Gov . 
Ned Lamont said that while he will listen to the federal government ’s guidance on reopening the economy , the decision will ultimately be up to individual states . 
" The feds can get the reagents , the feds can get the testing kits , the feds can tell us what type of antibody testing is approved so we can roll that out , and then at the end of the day , I think it 's the governors who are going to get it done , " Lamont said . 
Lamond said Connecticut is still trying to obtain supplies such as reagents and masks from the federal government stockpile . 
President Trump is expected to issue guidance today on reopening the country ’s economy . 
Lamont says they will weigh his guidelines , as well as ones from experts like Dr . Anthony Fauci , but in the end , governors will make their own decisions for their states . 
" I think a lot of my regional governors are out there on their own , " Lamont said . 
" We ca not simply wait for the federal government 's guidance . 
But I 'll listen when it comes . " 
Lamont said he wo not recommend opening businesses and schools before there is broad testing available . 
" I think that would be really dangerous , " he said . 
Lamont also said he will be issuing guidelines in the coming days for wearing masks in the state to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
He said he wants people to wear masks whenever they are not able to socially distance , including at the grocery store .
