President Trump announced a proposed measure to reopen the economy in three phases at today 's daily coronavirus briefing . 
Earlier today Trump gave state governors the proposed plan . 
CNN reported on the recommendations sent to governors earlier Thursday . 
The plan outlines the " proposed state or regional gating criteria " for each phase . 
It includes when to reopen restaurants , bars , gyms and public spaces and gives guidance for employers , as well as phasing in nonessential travel . 
In the first phase of reopening , the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so . 
Large venues can operate under strict social distancing protocols . 
Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines , but bars should remain shuttered . 
The President said that because states are all different , governors will make decisions based on individual needs . 
" If they need to remain closed , we will allow them to do that . 
If they believe it is time to reopen , we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task and very , very quickly depending on what they want to do , " he said . 
The phased plan also encourages employers to enact social distancing , temperature checks , testing and sanitation practices .
