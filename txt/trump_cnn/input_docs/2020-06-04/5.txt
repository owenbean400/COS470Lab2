Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , told CNN he ’s concerned that vaccine " skepticism " could hinder the effort to immunize the country against Covid 19 . 
A vaccine could come on the market as early as next year , and Collins said he hopes " the American public will embrace this as an opportunity to protect themselves , and the rest of their community , in order to get us all back to some sort of normal state . " 
Some people have expressed concern that President Trump ’s name for the campaign to develop a coronavirus vaccine — " Operation Warp Speed " — leaves the impression that scientists are rushing through the vaccine testing process . 
" Maybe we ’ve got some work to do to try to explain exactly once we have the data , why these vaccines are in fact proven to be safe and effective , " he added . 
Collins said that despite the drive to get the vaccine out in record time , nothing would compromise the science . 
" As a scientist , a physician and the director of the National Institutes of Health , we will make these decisions solely on the basis of the evidence for individual vaccines . 
This will not be influenced by other factors that might put people at risk , " he said .
