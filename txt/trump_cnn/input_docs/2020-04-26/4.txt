Some people in recent days have opened their mailboxes and found something unusual : a personal letter from President Donald Trump . 
CNN has obtained a copy of the letter , signed by the President , sent to recipients of the federal stimulus payment . 
In the letter , Trump said he " proudly signed into law " the CARES Act , which authorized payments to individuals . 
The letter states : " I am pleased to notify that as provided by the CARES Act , you are receiving an Economic Impact Payment ... 
We hope this payment provides meaningful support to you during this period . " 
The return address is the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service . 
The envelope says " Postage and Fees Paid , Internal Revenue Service . " 
In the legislation , there is a section saying " Not later than 15 days after the date on which the ( Treasury ) Secretary distributed any payment to an eligible taxpayer pursuant to this subsection , notice shall be sent by mail to such taxpayer 's last known address . 
Such notice shall indicate the method by which such payment was made , the amount of such payment , and a phone number for the appropriate point of contact at the Internal Revenue Service to report any failure to receive such payment . " 
CNN reported Friday that more than 88 million people received their payments totaling nearly $ 158 billion , the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said . 
That leaves about 62 million others . 
Individuals are due up to $ 1,200 , and married couples can receive up to $ 2,400 . 
The amount decreases as income increases .
