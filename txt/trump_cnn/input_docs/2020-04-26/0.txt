Dr . Anthony Fauci jokingly said that if any actor was going to portray him on " Saturday Night Live , " he 'd want Brad Pitt . 
On Saturday night , Fauci got his wish . 
In a surprise appearance , Pitt played Fauci at the opening of Saturday 's " SNL , " which was produced remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic . 
" First , I 'd like to thank all the older women in America who have sent me supportive , inspiring and sometimes graphic e mails , " Pitt as Fauci said . 
Pitt 's Fauci then explained that there 's been a lot of misinformation out there about the coronavirus , and that " yes , the President has taken some liberties with our guidelines . " 
He then said he 'd like to explain what President Trump was " trying to say . " 
" And remember , let 's all keep an open mind , " Pitt 's Fauci said . 
The sketch then proceeded to show clips of Trump talking about the outbreak . 
The first had Trump saying that the country would have a vaccine " relatively soon . " 
" Relatively soon is an interesting phrase . 
Relative to the entire history of earth ? 
Sure , the vaccine is going to come real fast , " Pitt 's Fauci said . 
" But if you were going to tell a friend , ' I 'll be over relatively soon ' and then showed up a year and a half later , well , your friend may be relatively pissed off . "
