White House Coronavirus task force response coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said President Trump 's suggestion on Thursday that injecting UV light or disinfectants into the human body as possible coronavirus treatments was a " dialogue " between the president and acting Department of Homeland Security official Bill Bryan about new information . 
When the President turned to her at the briefing she made it clear , and the President understood , that injections were not a treatment for the virus , she told CNN on Sunday . 
Bryan had presented a study about how light and disinfectants could help kill the virus on surfaces and exposing the outer part of the body — but not doing so inside . 
Birx said it was " unfortunate " that critical information about the impact of direct sunlight on the aerosolization of the virus detailed in the study Bryan presented was lost during the stir over the President 's comments . 
Birx said it bothers her that the President 's comments are still a topic of conversation because she thinks " we 're missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people , to continue to protect one another . " 
Some background : During the briefing , President Trump specifically directed a question at Birx about the possibility of sunlight and disinfectant , according to the official White House transcript . 
The transcript had to be officially amended to reflect that Birx responded to the President ’s question by saying " Not as a treatment , " instead of " That is a treatment . " 
During a bill signing ceremony in the Oval Office on Friday , Trump said he was not speaking to either Birx or Bryan , but was instead addressing reporters and being sarcastic .
