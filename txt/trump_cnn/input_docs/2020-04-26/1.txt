Sen . 
Bill Cassidy , a republican from Louisiana , is proposing a $ 500 billion bill that would give emergency relief funds to state and local governments as several of the nation 's governors say they need federal money to continue daily operations . 
One third of the money would be awarded based on population size , one third based on the number of coronavirus cases in the state and one third based on the state 's revenue loss , Cassidy said . 
He said supporting local governments means supporting small businesses . 
" Your city is going bankrupt because they rely upon sales tax , hotel bed tax , tourism to keep the police , to keep the fire , to keep the sanitation , " he told CNN Sunday morning . 
" The city 's bankrupt because a federally ordered lockdown has happened and now you do not have the police , the sanitation . 
What is your restaurant going to do ? 
It 's going to close its doors . 
Garbage piling up in front , and rats running in the garbage , is not what brings people through your doors . " 
He said supporting the system of city workers who help businesses thrive , is important to the reopening of the economy . 
Some background : Some states say they are facing billion dollar budget deficits because of spending needed to battle the coronavirus pandemic . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell floated the possibility of states declaring bankruptcy rather than receive more federal aid . 
While Republicans are in general agreement with Mc Connell that they should hit pause on any new funding , some GOP senators like Cassidy are publicly and privately expressing an openness toward a new round of aid to cash strapped state and local governments President Trump signed a more than $ 480 billion coronavirus relief package into law earlier this week –– but it did not include money for state governments .
