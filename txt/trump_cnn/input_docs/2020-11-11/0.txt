Nursing homes in the United States are still taking days to get back Covid 19 test results as many shun the Trump administration 's central strategy to limit the spread of the virus among old and sick Americans . 
In late summer , federal officials began distributing to nursing homes millions of point of care antigen tests , which can be given on site and report the presence or absence of the virus within minutes . 
By January , the Department of Health and Human Services is slated to send roughly 23 million rapid tests . 
But as of October 25 , 38 % of the nation 's roughly 15,000 nursing homes have yet to use a point of care test , a KHN analysis of nursing home records shows . 
The numbers suggest a basic disagreement among the Trump administration , state health officials and nursing home administrators over the best way to test this population and how to strike the right balance between speed and accuracy . 
Many nursing homes still primarily send samples out to laboratories , using a type of test that 's considered more reliable but can take days to deliver results . 
As a result , in 29 % of the approximately 13,000 facilities that provided their testing speed to the government , results for residents took an average of three days or more , the analysis found . 
Just 17 % of nursing homes reported their average turnaround time was less than a day , and the remainder tended to get results in one or two days . 
Wait times for test results of staff members were similar .
