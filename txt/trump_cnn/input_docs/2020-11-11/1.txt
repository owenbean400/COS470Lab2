Doctors from Harvard University have shared serious reservations about the Trump administration ’s Covid 19 antibody treatment rollout , in an editorial published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association . 
The editorial -- written before the announcement that Eli Lilly ’s monoclonal antibody treatment won emergency use authorization on Monday and would be sent out to clinics as early as this week -- focuses on Regeneron ’s treatment . 
It has not yet been given an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration . 
Dr . Robert Goldstein , an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School , said he believed Regeneron is likely to get the nod soon , and what he knows about the rollout plans for both could put a serious strain on the system and potentially worsen inequities in treatment . 
Goldstein said doctors still do not have a lot of detail about which patients best benefit from the treatments . 
Much of what doctors know comes from news releases . 
News releases may reassure investors , he said , but they leave doctors with too many questions about who to treat -- especially in cases like this one , when treatments are in such limited supply . 
Goldstein is also concerned about how the antibody treatments need to be administered -- in a health care office with space for someone to be infused for an hour and observed for another hour . 
Many safety net and rural health care systems do not have this kind of capacity , he said . 
The editorial ’s final concern is that there is no obligation for doctors to document how well the therapy works . 
Goldstein said he understands the US needs to move forward quickly in a public health crisis , especially if treatments can reduce hospitalizations , which reached an all time high Tuesday . 
" But we can do this better , " he said . 
" We know that we can do this better and we should be doing it better . "
