The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of " accelerating " coronavirus spread and strongly recommending increased testing as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country . 
The task force , which warned of " significant deterioration in the Sunbelt " in last week ’s set of reports , said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week , " leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date . " 
The weekly reports continue to provide an unvarnished , unfiltered look at the reality of each state ’s current situation , which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the pandemic publicly in weeks . 
The task force leadership is under constant scrutiny , while the White House has repeatedly declined to make all of its reports publicly accessible . 
In recommendations to several states , the task force called for an expansion of testing , particularly to target asymptomatic cases . 
The reports added : " Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts , inclusive of mask wearing , physical distancing , hand hygiene , and immediate isolation , contact tracing , and quarantine . "
