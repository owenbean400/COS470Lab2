House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , the two top negotiators for a new round of coronavirus relief , are engaged in open warfare after weeks of private negotiations -- casting new doubt on whether they will be able to reach agreement on stimulus legislation even after the November election . 
On Thursday afternoon , Mnuchin slammed Pelosi in their highest profile clash so far , saying the speaker is refusing to compromise to get much needed aid to Americans . 
His remarks came after Pelosi sent her own letter to Mnuchin earlier Thursday that emphasized just how divided the two sides remain on the details of a potential stimulus bill , and hit the Trump administration for not accepting Democratic demands on key issues . 
Mnuchin said he first learned of Pelosi â€™s letter from media reports Thursday morning , and he " can unfortunately only conclude that it is a political stunt . " 
What this means for the bill : The confrontation between the two is inauspicious for the odds of a new stimulus bill . 
When everyone else had essentially given up on the idea of another round of coronavirus relief over the summer , Pelosi and Mnuchin continued to have phone calls to negotiate and work towards a deal . 
With Democratic leaders standing firmly behind their call for a massive aid package and Republican lawmakers instead advocating for a much smaller , targeted bill , an agreement never really appeared imminent . 
But Pelosi and Mnuchin continued to insist progress was being made -- and sometimes , it was . 
Both had previously expressed hope that a deal could be finalized before Election Day , but talks have faltered in recent days . 
At a news conference earlier in the day , Pelosi said the talks were not over . 
She indicated she is eyeing the congressional lame duck session after the election as an opportunity for lawmakers to approve new aid .
