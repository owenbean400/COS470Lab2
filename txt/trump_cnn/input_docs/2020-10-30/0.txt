Dr . Deborah Birx emerged from a meeting at the White House one day in late summer with a new resolution : Never again would she sit in a meeting with Dr . Scott Atlas and listen to him pontificate on the pandemic . 
That 's when she went all in on a plan to essentially abandon the White House and avoid the growing influence of Atlas , a radiologist with no expertise in epidemiology who was nevertheless rising in influence with President Donald Trump . 
Birx , a physician with decades of experience in global health , told a friend that she would take her message directly to the people and simply sidestep the kind of misleading messages she 'd just heard from Atlas in that meeting . 
The friend requested anonymity to discuss the exchange with CNN . 
Now Atlas is Trump 's single go to adviser on the coronavirus . 
And Birx , one of the most prominent figures of the early pandemic , is in North Dakota . 
She has now been to 40 states and logged more than 20,000 miles , many of them since that fateful August meeting . 
She tours the country by commercial air , advising small groups of state and local officials on combating transmission . 
She pulls a small suitcase packed with essentials and an array of the signature scarves she wears each day . 
Her friends call it her " self exile . " 
It 's a handy personal credo given that Trump has not consulted in person with Birx in months . 
She still belongs to the White House coronavirus task force , but it rarely meets these days and its reports are not widely disseminated . 
The President is not deploying her to anything , so she 's deploying herself .
