The US Food and Drug Administration warned against giving a controversial drug to patients who are also getting the one drug that has any authorization for use in treating coronavirus . 
Mixing remdesivir and either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine could reduce the effectiveness of remdesivir , the FDA warned . 
Earlier on Monday , the FDA removed the emergency use authorization it had given the two malaria drugs , leaving remdesivir as the only drug that has the authorization for Covid 19 . 
" The agency is not aware of instances of this reduced activity occurring in the clinical setting but is continuing to evaluate all data related to remdesivir , " the FDA said . 
More on this : Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were touted by President Trump as good drugs to take to treat coronavirus , and he said last month that he himself was taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus infection . 
Several studies have shown not only that the drugs do not help patients with Covid 19 , but they might raise the risk of serious side effects . 
On Monday , the FDA said the drugs do not meet " the statutory criteria " for emergency use authorization as they are unlikely to be effective in treating Covid 19 based on the latest scientific evidence . 
Remdesivir is an infused antiviral drug made by Gilead Sciences Inc .
