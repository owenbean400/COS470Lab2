Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said he would advise against attending large political rallies . 
Gottlieb also said that as we are taking many infections with us heading into fall , that the government and the Trump administration should be setting an example by encouraging people to wear masks and social distance . 
Setting this example would be " a powerful message to individual people across the country , " he said . 
Gottlieb agreed with comments made by White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx about the use of masks at nationwide protests being less effective due to things like shouting , saying that he had seen data that supported this . 
" Obviously the risk is a little bit diminished when you â€™re outside versus indoors , but we know these large gatherings are going to lead to more spread , " Gottlieb said . 
However , while there are things that can be done to reduce the risks , this is a shared responsibility for everyone .
