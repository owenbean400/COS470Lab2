President Trump noted in a public message on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic poses a significant risk for men , adding that men are less likely than women to seek care for health concerns . 
The address was made in recognition of Men 's Health Week , the week leading up to Father 's Day . 
" Accordingly , it is critical that men who show symptoms of the coronavirus , including shortness of breath , cough , fever , aches , or chills , immediately contact their doctor or healthcare provider . 
Doing so will ensure that they receive the care they need and help prevent the spread of this disease , " Trump said in part . 
Trump added that the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act has enhanced access to health care and treatment services for all health conditions , including mental illness , while also reducing the likelihood of transmission of diseases like coronavirus by expanding telehealth coverage for the duration of this public health emergency . 
This presidential message comes at a time when Trump has been planning a rally in Tulsa , Oklahoma — despite concerns about social distancing — and he has not been wearing a mask during public speeches and press conferences . 
What the research says : Researchers have noted that more men appear to be dying from Covid 19 than women during the pandemic . 
A CNN analysis earlier this year found that in the countries for which data was available — spanning nearly a quarter of the world 's population — men were 50 % more likely than women to die after being diagnosed with Covid 19 .
