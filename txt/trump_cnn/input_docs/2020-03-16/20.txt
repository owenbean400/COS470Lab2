Despite concerns about large groups of people being together in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak , officials in Arizona say they will not be postponing the state 's presidential primary scheduled for Tuesday . 
" Our election leaders have been working overtime to ensure that voting is safe , " Gov . 
Doug Ducey said at a news conference Monday . 
Only Democrats will be going to the polls in Arizona on Tuesday . 
The Arizona Republican Party decided last year not to hold a primary , instead planning to give all of the state â€™s 2020 delegates to President Donald Trump without opposition . 
Although Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has the authority to postpone the election in an emergency , she said , " We have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future . " 
Hobbs said the decision is also in the best interests of the workers who are needed to tabulate the results . 
" There are thousands of workers in communities across the state that must continue the job of counting the ballots in the days following the election , " Hobbs said . 
" The longer we wait , the more difficult and dangerous this will become . "
