After multiple confirmed cases at President Donald Trump â€™s Mar a Lago resort last week , including a fundraiser attendee and an aide to the Brazilian President , the club is undergoing a deep clean , a member told CNN . 
Members were notified via email that the club will be closed Monday for cleaning . 
This includes its grand ballroom but excludes the beach club , which is across the street from the main area and will remain open . 
Dinner will be served as usual Tuesday through Saturday .
