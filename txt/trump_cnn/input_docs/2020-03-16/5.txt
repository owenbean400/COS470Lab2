There are active discussions within the Trump administration to encourage a possible " curfew " across the nation in which non essential businesses would be encouraged to close by a certain time each night , according to an administration official and another source familiar . 
The recommendation would likely focus on malls , restaurants and bars . 
Grocery stores and pharmacies could be exempt from the curfew . 
The idea would be fashioned after the European model but would likely have to be enforced at a local level . 
The source familiar tells CNN that a curfew could be strongly encouraged at the state level . 
Vice President Mike Pence ’s spokeswoman Katie Miller strongly disputed that a curfew was under discussions . 
" A curfew is not on the table , " she said . 
Miller said curfews would not be discussed during the President ’s video teleconference with governors today .
