President Donald Trump and his administration have prevented public health officials from using the might of the country ’s foremost disease fighting agency to properly respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic , said Dr . William Foege , the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
USA Today posted the letter online this week . 
He told NPR he does not know how USA Today got a copy of the letter , but that he stands by what he said . 
In the letter , Foege wrote to Redfield that the Trump administration has " tarnished the CDC ’s reputation as the premiere global public health agency through its bungled Covid 19 response , and that the situation in the US " is a slaughter and not just a political dispute . " 
Foege told NPR he felt he had to speak up . 
" If you know how to prevent torture and do not do it , you become the torturer , " Foege said , quoting from the writings of a Holocaust survivor . 
" This is the burden I found myself living under : that silence was complicity . "
