Monoclonal antibody treatments like the one President Donald Trump got may be the most effective approach for treating coronavirus infections , Microsoft founder Bill Gates said Thursday . 
Last Friday , Trump was given an antibody cocktail produced by biotechnology company Regeneron which included a pair of monoclonal antibodies that target the spike protein the virus uses to drill into healthy cells . 
Trump left the hospital and returned to the White House Monday . 
Regeneron and pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co . have applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for their monoclonal antibody products . 
Early data from clinical trials of Eli Lilly and Co ’s monoclonal antibody indicates a 60 % reduction in hospitalization rates , Gates said . 
He said Lilly hopes to be able to treat patients with very low doses of the lab engineered immune system proteins . 
Gates said monoclonal treatments may end up being far cheaper than the formulations now used to treat cancer , rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions -- treatments than can run hundreds of thousands of dollars a year , Gates predicted . 
" If everything goes well , the cost of this intervention could be only a few hundred dollars or even under $ 100 , " Gates said . 
Gates , who has spun his fortune into a major medical and public health philanthropy , said the Bill & Melinda gates Foundation had invested in manufacturing monoclonals . 
Trump has said he thought the Regeneron treatment he was given last week had cured him . 
" The word cure is a bit of an overpromise , " Gates said , laughing . 
" That makes it sound like it works for everyone and the whole concern about this disease will go away , and that ’s the last thing we want people to think about . "
