President Trump " failed to tell the public the truth that he knew " about the novel coronavirus in February , veteran journalist Bob Woodward told CNN 's Anderson Cooper Tuesday night . 
Speaking on CNN 's " Anderson Cooper 360 , " Woodward said the President knew the seriousness of the virus in February . 
Woodward went on to say that Trump could have warned Americans about the virus during his State of the Union speech that month . 
Trump told Woodward he knew how deadly the virus was , telling the journalist on Feb . 7 , " This is deadly stuff . " 
In March , Trump admitted he kept that knowledge hidden from the public . 
" I wanted to always play it down , " Trump told Woodward on March 19 , even as he had declared a national emergency over the virus days earlier . 
" I still like playing it down , because I do not want to create a panic . " 
In a new clip aired on " Anderson Cooper 360 " Tuesday , Woodward asked Trump on March 19 , " Was there a moment in all of this , last two months , where you said to yourself â€” you know , you 're waking up or whatever you 're doing and you say , ' Ah , this is the leadership test of a lifetime ? ' " " No , " Trump replied . 
Woodward asked , " No ? " 
" I think it might be , but I do not think that , " Trump said . 
" All I want to do is get it solved . 
There are many people that said that to me . 
They said , you 're now a wartime President . "
