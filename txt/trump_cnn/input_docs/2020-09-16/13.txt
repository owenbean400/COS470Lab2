President Trump confirmed an earlier report that a White House staff member has tested positive for coronavirus . 
Press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany later said that it was just one person who tested positive . 
" It did not effect the event and press was not around the individual , " Mc Enany said , apparently referring to the President ’s town hall event last night in Philadelphia . 
" And it ’s not anybody that ’s near me , " Trump added . 
" It was one person , not a person that I was associated with . " 
Trump did not answer when asked if it was at the event in Philadelphia . 
The information stems from today 's foreign print pool reporter , Raquel Krähenbühl , who wrote on Twitter earlier today that she was told the press pool was tested late today because : " It was a very busy morning . 
We had a couple of positives today . " 
It 's unclear who told this to the foreign print pool reporter and the information has not been included in any pool reports seen by CNN . 
The White House declined to comment to CNN . 
Earlier White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters , " I do not comment on any health related issues as it relates to the White House ever . " 
The suspected positive coronavirus case inside the White House come a day after visits from Trump allies and foreign delegations from Israel , the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain for the signing of peace agreements .
