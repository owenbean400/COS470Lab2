Admiral Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health at the Health and Human Services Department , denied Wednesday he had ever been asked to test fewer Americans to make the pandemic look less serious than it really is . 
Sen Dick Durbin , a Democrat from Illinois , asked Giroir , who heads testing efforts for the White House Coronavirus Task Force , about comments President Trump has made repeatedly saying the reason the US has so many cases of Covid 19 is because the US does more testing . 
When Durbin asked during Wednesday ’s Senate Appropriations Hearing if ending testing would end the spread of Covid 19 , Giroir answered , " No , sir . " 
Detecting as many cases as possible means that they can be appropriately isolated and contact tracing can happen , he said . 
" It is true that the more testing you do , the more cases you will discover , " Giroir said . 
" But the cases are there no matter what . " 
Giroir said that he has " never been asked , told , hinted , suggested that we should decrease testing . " 
He said every time the task force meets , they work to expand testing . 
" My job is to expand testing as much as feasibly , even infeasibly , possible and get the right test to the right people at the right time , " he said . 
" That ’s been my mission . 
No one ’s told me to alter that . "
