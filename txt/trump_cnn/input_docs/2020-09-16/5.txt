US President Donald Trump said in March that he did not consider the coronavirus pandemic a once in a lifetime leadership challenge , even as the country was going through historic shutdowns to fight the spread , according to a new interview shared by veteran journalist Bob Woodward . 
" Was there a moment in all of this , last two months , where you said to yourself -- you know , you 're waking up or whatever you 're doing and you say , ' Ah , this is the leadership test of a lifetime ? ' 
" Woodward asked Trump on March 19 , in a new clip aired on CNN 's " Anderson Cooper 360 " on Tuesday night .

By the March 19 interview , there had been 265 reported deaths in the United States from the virus .
