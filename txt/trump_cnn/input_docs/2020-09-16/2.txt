US President Donald Trump insisted that he did not downplay the coronavirus but rather " up played it in terms of action taken " at ABC ’s town hall on Tuesday night . 
Responding to a question from an undecided voter at ABC ’s town hall , Trump contradicted his own statements to journalist and author Bob Woodward in which he said he " wanted to always play it down . " 
Trump said last week that he was a cheerleader for the country and did not want to create a panic responding to the comments he made to Woodward . 
" The fact is , I ’m a cheerleader for this country , I love our country , and I do not want people to be frightened . 
I do not want to create panic , as you say , " Trump said on Sept . 9 .
