Retail sales ticked up in August from the previous month but at a slower pace after the enhanced unemployment benefits provided by the federal government ended . 
US retail sales rose 0.6 % in August , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday . 
That 's below the 1 % predicted by economists surveyed by Refinitv . 
In July , retail sales grew 0.9 % , the Commerce Department said . 
That gain already was significantly slower than the 8.4 % gain in June . 
A supplemental $ 600 weekly unemployment insurance , which had been part of the government 's first stimulus bill , ran out at the end of July . 
Since then , Congress has been unable to agree another boost to jobless benefits . 
President Trump signed an executive order to bolster benefits again , although by less money , by diverting funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . 
Consumer spending is the biggest engine of US economic growth , and retail sales are an important component of that . 
The report from the Commerce Department , however , does not include spending on services â€” things like hair cuts , medical care and financial services . 
Some economists say continued growth in retail sales depends on future government stimulus funds and relief to people who have lost their jobs . 
Some background : Retail sales slumped to a seven year low in April as the coronavirus prompted stores across the country to shut their doors . 
Sales bounced back to pre pandemic levels in July . 
Although retail sales have bounced back , the spending has not gone to all retailers equally . 
So far in 2020 , nearly 8,000 stores have said they will permanently close , according to Coresight Research , a retail research and advisory firm . 
It anticipates closures will set a new annual record this year with as many as 25,000 , breaking last year 's record 9,302 closures tracked by the firm .
