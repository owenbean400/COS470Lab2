Alaska Airlines is cutting flights for the third time since the coronavirus pandemic began . 
In a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Seattle based carrier said the latest cutbacks will mean an 80 % drop compared to its typical number of flights for April and May . 
The new filing says " sizable cuts will be necessary for the coming months " beyond May , although Alaska Airlines says it will wait before making specific decisions that far into 2020 . 
The company also confirmed it has asked for payroll support grants under the CARES Act , one of the stimulus measures passed by Congress and signed by President Trump last month .
