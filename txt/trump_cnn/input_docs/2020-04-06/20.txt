Hydroxychloroquine will be used in a trial of 3,000 patients at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit , Michigan , and the results will be tracked in a formal study , Vice President Mike Pence announced Sunday . 
Pence added that they are " more than prepared " to make hydroxychloroquine available to doctor 's offices and pharmacies in the Detroit area " as they deem appropriate . " 
Rear Adm . John Polowczyk of the Supply Chain Logistics Task Force said that the government is working to put out millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine into areas with increasing number of coronavirus cases . 
President Donald Trump has frequently claimed the drug has high efficacy against Covid 19 despite no evidence the drug is effective and safe for preventing or treating the coronavirus . 
However , there is no " definitive information to be able to make any comment " on whether the drug can be used to treat coronavirus , said Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , at the White House briefing on Saturday . 
There are currently no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent Covid 19 .
