There was a heated disagreement in the Situation Room this weekend over the efficacy of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine -- but multiple sources say it was mostly one sided . 
President Donald Trump 's top trade adviser Peter Navarro feuded with other officials inside the coronavirus task force over the unproven drug 's treatment for the virus . 
Medical experts have repeatedly explained to the President that there is a risk in touting the drug in case ultimately it does not work . 
But other aides and outside advisers have sided with Trump , including Navarro , who is still not a formal part of the task force but has wedged himself into the meetings . 
What happened : While discussing the latest on hydroxychloroquine this weekend , Navarro lashed out at Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious diseases expert and one of those advisers who has urged caution about the drug , a person familiar with the meeting told CNN . 
Not data : Navarro had brought a stack of paperwork with him into the Situation Room on the drug , arguing it was proof that it could work to treat coronavirus , which Fauci disagreed with because it was not data . 
Not a proven treatment : A source close to the task force said Fauci is not backing off of his belief that hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment for coronavirus . 
When CNN â€™s Jeremy Diamond asked Fauci to comment on the matter Sunday night , Trump stepped in and did not allow Fauci to answer . 
But a source said the doctor has already offered his opinion on the drug in other venues and would continue to do so . 
The argument highlights how deep the divide runs over the task force 's response to the coronavirus outbreak : Another source told CNN that despite the disagreement in the Situation Room with Fauci and Navarro , Fauci continues to have a good relationship with Trump and Vice Presdient Mike Pence , though some staffers have shown irritation when his opinions differ .
