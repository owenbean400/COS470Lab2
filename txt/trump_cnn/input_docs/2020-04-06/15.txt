President Donald Trump said that he ’s " going to get involved " in the case of a Navy captain removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt . 
At a Monday briefing , Trump was asked about comments made by Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly , who attacked Capt . Brett Crozier as either " too naive or too stupid " to be in command . 
" I have not heard it exactly , I heard they heard , " Trump said , referring to the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt . 
" I heard they had a statement that was made , if that were the statement , it ’s a strong statement . " 
Crozier was relieved of command after a letter he sent to Navy leadership was leaked to the media . 
The letter flagged his concerns about the Roosevelt 's crew of more than 4,000 -- saying in part that " sailors do not need to die " - - and discussed the challenges of trying to contain an outbreak of coronavirus aboard the ship . 
He urgently requested that sailors be allowed to quarantine on land . 
The Navy cited loss of confidence in his command . 
" The letters should not have been sent , and certainly they should not have been leaked , " Trump said . 
" This is a military operation . 
I must tell you I ’ve heard very good things about the gentlemen . 
Both gentlemen , by the way , I will say this . 
About both gentlemen . 
And I may look into it from the standpoint of something should be resolved because I ’m hearing good things about both of people . "
