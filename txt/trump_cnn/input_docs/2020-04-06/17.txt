President Donald Trump on Monday questioned whether politics tinged the findings of a newly released Health and Human Services inspector general report that found hospitals have been most concerned about a shortage of coronavirus testing supplies and long wait times for test results . 
After listening to a reporter citing the report during Monday ’s White House press briefing , Trump responded , " It ’s just wrong . 
It ’s just wrong . 
Did I hear the word ‘ inspector general ' ? 
Really ? " 
The President also questioned the integrity of the leadership in HHS ’ Office of the Inspector General saying , " Well where did he come from , the inspector general ? 
What ’s his name ? " 
" We ’ve had more testing and had more results than any country anywhere in the world . 
They ’re doing an incredible job , " the President continued . 
" So give me the name of the inspector general . 
Could politics be entered into that ? " he concluded . 
The report was based on interviews with more than 300 hospitals around the country . 
Admiral Brett Giroir , who serves as the assistant secretary for health , expressed frustration with the recent OIG report ’s findings , saying during Monday ’s briefing that the OIG ’s office did not adequately communicate with him . 
Giroir pointed out that the report was done around March 23 and March 24 , which he said was " during a ramp up period . " 
" It ’s hard to interpret the report because it mixes up all kinds of things , but clearly there were complaints by some hospitals of a backlog , had probably sent out tests , and that is true . 
There were several days of backlog as some of the major labs that have been taken care , " Giroir said .
