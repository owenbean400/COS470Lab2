Asked about the possibility of restrictions on travel between coronavirus hotspots , President Donald Trump said : " There â€™s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes . " 
Facts First : There is no evidence that plane passengers in the US are being tested for the coronavirus at all , let alone both when they get on and get off the plane . 
While it is theoretically possible this is happening under the radar at a particular airport , it is certainly not happening widely . 
Trump might have meant to refer to screening -- which involves questioning and sometimes temperature checks -- rather than actual testing , but major US airlines are not doing screening , either . 
Some plane passengers are being subjected to government screening upon landing , but most passengers are not -- and this screening , unlike testing , cannot conclusively determine whether someone has the virus .
