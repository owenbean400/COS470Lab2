President Trump ’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday that loans under the program aimed at assisting small businesses impacted by coronavirus reached $ 38 billion , and he dismissed glitches that hindered the program ’s rollout . 
In an interview with CNBC , Kudlow said , " the glitches will get worked . 
It 's a monumental undertaking . " 
A number of banks said they would not take part in the program during its launch on Friday because the government had failed to provide enough information in advance . 
Trump over the weekend described the rollout as " flawless . " 
Kudlow says that the President " does not want the cure to be worse than the problem " and asserted that the coronavirus itself must be mitigated before any talk of reopening the economy can be considered . 
" The health side has to come first , " Kudlow said . 
" The health side must continue to come first and the mitigation efforts , we believe , are working . " 
He said that the government ’s priority remains " phase three " of an assistance program . 
He also said that the Federal Reserve is likely going to continue rolling out various initiatives aimed at easing the economic crisis , including " a main street lending facility . " 
Kudlow added that he is interested in selling bonds " in order to raise money for the war effort , in this case the pandemic effort . " 
" Why not sell large bonds , why not go for it in a patriotic way , and an American safety way , and to bring the economy back whenever that can be possible , " he said .
