" Hello , everyone , I 'm Principal O 'Grady . 
Welcome to the St . Mary Magdalene By The Expressway class of 2020 virtual graduation , " Kate Mc Kinnon said to a zoom conference of the entire class playing students . 
" I know this is not how you expected your high school career to come to an end , but we 're all making sacrifices . 
I have had to share my child 's Adderall with him . " 
Mc Kinnon 's principal told the class that she tried to get the class 's preferred speakers of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama , but they said no as did the next five choices . 
" So I moved on to your eighth choice , receiving one vote , President Donald Trump , " she said .
