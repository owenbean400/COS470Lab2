Hong Kongers have continued stockpiling toilet paper amid fears the city may run out of it , despite the fact that the government has denied the rumor that spurred the panic buying . 
Unconfirmed reports had circulated that mainland China would stop exporting certain goods -- specifically toilet paper -- to Hong Kong , as more borders between the two places closed . 
The Hong Kong government has quashed the rumors and appealed for calm . 
Emergency measures , including closing several borders , " will not affect the freight services between the mainland and Hong Kong , " the government said in a statement . 
But the reassurances do not seem to have had much effect -- one supermarket 's website is so swamped that users have to join an online queue , with a wait stretching for more than an hour . 
And many stores ' toilet paper and paper towel shelves were empty on Saturday .
