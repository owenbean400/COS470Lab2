China ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) said Monday that Hong Kong ’s legislative council elections are considered local elections in China , adding no foreign entity has " any right to interfere and nothing could justify such interference . " 
Here 's some background : On Friday Hong Kong ’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam used a colonial era emergency regulation to postpone the September Legislative Council elections by a year due to the growing Covid 19 outbreak in Hong Kong . 
Some pro democracy lawmakers accused the government of wanting to avoid a potential loss following China 's imposition of a new national security law on the city . 
MOFA spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Monday that the decision was a " legitimate measure to protect Hong Kong residents safety and health " and a way to ensure the elections " can be safe , fair , and just . " 
" There are many precedents postponing elections because of disasters such as an epidemic . 
The Hong Kong SAR government 's decision is in line with this common practice , is legitimate , reasonable , and lawful , " Wang said .
