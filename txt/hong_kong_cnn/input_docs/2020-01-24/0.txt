Many pharmacies and other shops in Hong Kong are running low on face masks as residents of the city -- where memories of the 2003 SARS crisis are still very fresh -- bulk buy them ahead of the Lunar New Year break . 
According to public broadcaster RTHK , multiple stores have already run out , raising fears that they will not be able to restock before the middle of next week , due to the public holiday , which runs through until Wednesday in Hong Kong . 
Hong Kong 's Department of Health and the Hospital Authority said in a statement that there was a three month stockpile sufficient to cover medical workers and patients . 
The city 's Food and Health Bureau is liaising with suppliers at the wholesale level to " ascertain scope for expediting the delivery of and stepping up local supplies . " 
The city 's Consumer Council urged traders not to raise prices of face masks to " outrageous levels " as demand spikes . 
In mainland China , online retailer Taobao has banned stores from hiking prices . 
Pharmacies in Macao have reportedly begun restricting the sale of face masks to 10 per customer .
