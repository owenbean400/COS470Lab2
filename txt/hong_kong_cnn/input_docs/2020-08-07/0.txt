Covid 19 appears to suppress the function of important immune system cells , preventing the body from fighting off the infection , researchers in Hong Kong reported Thursday . 
The team at the University of Hong Kong ( HKU ) said their findings , published in the peer reviewed journal Immunity , indicate that boosting immune response with certain drugs might help patients recover better . 
It ’s an approach already being tested by several groups . 
The researchers looked at the blood of 41 patients treated for coronavirus in Hong Kong early in the pandemic , and compared their immune function to that of healthy volunteers . 
Immune system cells known as dendritic cells , along with T cells and natural killer cells in patients with Covid 19 all appeared to be suppressed . 
All these cells are part of the body ’s response to an infection . 
One of the drugs tested was interferon beta 1b . 
It was initially developed as a treatment for multiple sclerosis , but because it targets the body 's immune system , it is also being tested in coronavirus patients .
