Hong Kong announced Friday the suspension of all schools in the city , following a surge in locally transmitted coronavirus cases . 
Summer holiday for public school students was originally scheduled to begin in late July . 
The announcement comes after Hong Kong reported 42 coronavirus cases on Thursday , including 34 locally transmitted infections . 
The Hong Kong government has tightened social distancing measures in a bid to contain the fresh outbreak . 
Ben Cowling , a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong , said on Twitter that the " effective reproductive number " -- the average number of people each coronavirus carrier goes on to infect -- for local infections is now close to 3 , which will take " a lot of effort to bring down . " 
That number was estimated to be around 2 during the previous wave of outbreak in late March , Cowling said .
