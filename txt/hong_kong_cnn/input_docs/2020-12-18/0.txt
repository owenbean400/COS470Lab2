Hong Kong will provide $ 826 million in relief for struggling local industries in an effort to help businesses stay afloat through the Covid 19 pandemic this holiday season , according to the city 's Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung . 
Speaking to media on Thursday , Cheung said that many sectors have been hit hard by tighter restrictions during the city 's fourth wave of cases , and the government is " responding to calls for a new round of financial relief package . " 
According to official documents , the fourth subsidy program will see $ 709.4 million injected into sectors including entertainment , catering , education and the beauty and massage industry . 
Meanwhile , $ 116 million will be set aside for emergency use . 
The latest package comes after the government warned earlier that there would be no further financial help after it gave $ 40 billion in aid during three previous rounds of assistance earlier this year .
