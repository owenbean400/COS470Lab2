The Hong Kong government has agreed to lead a $ 5 billion bailout of Cathay Pacific , taking a minority stake in the city 's beleaguered flagship carrier . 
Cathay and parent company Swire Pacific announced plans to raise 39 billion Hong Kong dollars ( $ 5 billion ) in new capital on Tuesday to help the airline survive the crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic . 
The Hong Kong government would provide the bulk of the new funds extending a bailout package worth 27.3 billion Hong Kong dollars ( $ 3.5 billion ) consisting of loans and preferred share purchases . 
The rest of the capital will come from issuing new stock . 
Hong Kong 's flagship carrier had already been suffering a slump in business because of widespread protests that rocked the city last year , when the coronavirus pandemic hit .
