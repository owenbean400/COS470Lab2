Hong Kong has postponed a much hyped travel bubble with Singapore due to a rise in coronavirus cases in the city , just hours after their counterparts in Singapore said it would go ahead . 
Edward Yau , Hong Kong 's secretary for commerce and economic development , announced the two week delay during a press conference on Saturday . 
" We had planned to launch the HK Singapore travel bubble tomorrow , " Yau said . 
" But in the light of the recent upsurge of local cases , we have decided together with Singapore government that we would defer the launching of the Air Travel bubble by two weeks . " 
" We will make further announcements perhaps by early December on the formal launching of the scheme , " he added . 
Singapore 's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung also announced in a Twitter post that the bubble has been delayed . 
But hours earlier , Singapore had said the bubble would go ahead despite the spike in Hong Kong , with extra precautions added to ensure safety . 
The " Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced that the Singapore Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble ( ATB ) will be launched as scheduled , with arriving passengers subject to an on arrival test as a further precaution , " Ong explained on Saturday . 
" Given the evolving situation in Hong Kong , Secretary Edward Yau and I discussed further this afternoon , and decided that it would be better to defer the launch of the ATB , by two weeks . 
We will review within two weeks on the new launch date and update again , " Ong said . 
Hong Kong has experienced a sharp rise in Covid 19 cases in the last few days after weeks of steadily low cases loads . 
" The scale of the increase is very alarming , " said Doctor Chuang Shuk kwan , head of the Communicable Disease Branch at Hong Kong â€™s Centre for Health Protection . 
She warned on Saturday that this new increase in cases will be " very difficult to control . "
