Flights between Singapore and Hong Kong will go ahead as part of the planned travel bubble which begins November 22 , despite a recent rise in Covid 19 cases in Hong Kong . 
There will be additional measures , however , according to Singapore 's Civil Aviation Authority ( CAAS . ) Travelers from Hong Kong will be required to take a Covid 19 PCR test upon arriving at Changi Airport that will cost 196 Singapore dollars ( $ 145 ) , except for the first week , to give travelers time to " adjust to this change . " 
Travelers will need to self isolate until they receive their results , which will take about six to eight hours . 
The travel bubble will be suspended if the seven day average of unlinked cases , or cases with an unknown origin , exceeds five per day , CAAS added . 
Hong Kong 's current average is 2.14 . " The threshold will be exceeded if there are more than 22 unlinked cases in Hong Kong over the next three days . 
This will trigger a two day notice period , after which suspension will come into effect , " a news release from the CAAS said . 
If this happens , there will be a two day notice before the bubble is suspended and a seven day Stay Home Notice ( SHN ) will be applied for travelers from Hong Kong into Singapore . 
" Hong Kong has a comprehensive public health surveillance system and the overall incidence rate is still low , " CAAS said .
