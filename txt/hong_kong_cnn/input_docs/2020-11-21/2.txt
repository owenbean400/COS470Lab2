Hong Kong recorded 43 new coronavirus cases on Saturday — the biggest daily jump in more than three months , according to a statement from the city ’s Centre for Health Protection ( CHP ) . 
Of the newly reported cases , 36 were locally transmitted , the statement said . 
" Given that the situation of COVID 19 infection remains severe and that there is a continuous increase in the number of cases reported around the world , members of the public are strongly urged to avoid all non essential travel outside Hong Kong , " the CHP spokesperson was quoted saying in the statement . 
The CHP also called on members of the public to avoid going out , having social contact and dining out . 
The announcement of the new cases comes after Hong Kong postponed a much hyped " travel bubble " with Singapore due to a rise in coronavirus cases in the city . 
Edward Yau , Hong Kong 's secretary for commerce and economic development , announced the two week delay during a press conference on Saturday . 
" We had planned to launch the HK Singapore travel bubble tomorrow , " Yau said . 
" But in the light of the recent upsurge of local cases , we have decided together with Singapore government that we would defer the launching of the Air Travel bubble by two weeks . "
