Health officials in Hong Kong are conducting a partial evacuation of residents from an apartment block following possibility that the coronavirus may have been transmitted via the building piping system , Professor KY Yuen said during an impromptu midnight press conference held on Tuesday morning local time . 
Health officials have traced at least two confirmed cases of the coronavirus to the specific residential building called Hong Mei House in the Tsing Yi area of Hong Kong . 
" As the pipeline that transfers feces is connected to the air pipe , it is very likely for the virus in the feces to be transmitted through the air fan into the toilet , " Professor Yuen said . 
Parts of the building were evacuated as a precaution while health officials and engineers carried out emergency checks , he added . 
Professor Yuen said that the transmission route is not clear yet , so the evacuation was taken to protect the residents of the building . 
This comes as local health officials confirmed that both the 42nd confirmed and latest case in the city and the 12th confirmed patient both lived in Hong Mei House . 
The 12th case was confirmed on January 30 and the 42nd case was confirmed on February 10 . 
Hong Kong now has 42 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus .
