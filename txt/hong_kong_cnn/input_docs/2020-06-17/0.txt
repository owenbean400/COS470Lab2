The US Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to three companies selling Covid 19 tests that the FDA says were " inappropriately " marketed and " potentially placing public health at risk . " 
This is the first time the agency says it has sent warning letters to companies for marketing adulterated or misbranded test kits . 
The letters went to Medakit Ltd . of Sheung Wan , Hong Kong ; 
Antibodiescheck.com and Yama Group ; and Dr . Jason Korkus , DDS and Sonrisa Family Dental d/b/a My COVID19 Club of Chicago , Illinois . 
The agency asked these companies to take immediate steps to fix violations and stop the sale of the products . 
The FDA said the companies violated policy by offering at home test kits in the US for sale without getting marketing approval or authorization . 
Products were misbranded as " FDA approved , " when they were not , and the products used the FDA logo which is only supposed to be used by the FDA and not used by the private sector , the agency said . 
The FDA said that if the companies do not take immediate action , the agency may take legal action that could include seizing the product . 
There is no home diagnostic or antibody test for Covid 19 authorized by the FDA . 
Home tests pose certain challenges for the public that may not be able to collect samples and interpret the results as well as a trained professional could . 
There are some FDA approved self diagnostic tests for people to use at home , but those require users to send those samples to a lab for processing .
