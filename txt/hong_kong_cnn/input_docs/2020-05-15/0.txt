With international travel restrictions , health checks , government measures and more , air travel looks very different in the age of Covid 19 . 
CNN International Correspondent Will Ripley took a flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong this week . 
A journey that typically takes about five hours instead became a days long exercise . 
" This is one of three flights per week , they tell me , and it 's flying with 109 passengers . 
The capacity is well over 400 , so about a fourth of the capacity , " said Ripley , once he got on the plane . 
" It 's easy to see why airlines are struggling so much right now . 
How do you sustain an airline , keep an airport open , when so few people are traveling ? " 
Ripley arrived in Hong Kong , where he received an electronic bracelet that will track his movements during the next 14 days to make sure he follows the mandatory quarantine ( which everyone arriving at the airport must do , even if they test negative for Covid 19 ) . 
He and all other passengers were required to get tested -- but because it was late in the evening , the results would not come in until the next day . 
So they were all taken to government provided accommodation at a hotel and provided with a free meal . 
Finally , 20 hours after he started his trip back to Hong Kong , Ripley got the news -- he tested negative . 
Now , it 's time to go home , where he will stay quarantined for the next two weeks . 
He will have to monitor his health , and fill out a government supplied daily log of his temperature and any potential symptoms .
