Hong Kong lawmaker Ann Chiang has clashed with her colleagues and a top medical official over whether you can clean and reuse face masks , as the semi autonomous Chinese city faces shortages and long queues at the few shops still with masks in stock . 
Speaking during a parliamentary session , Chiang , chair of the health services panel , asked Wong Ka hing , controller of the government run Center for Health Protection , " what if I ca not buy any surgical masks ? " 
" The public do not have so many masks as you do , " she told Wong , before asking if it " possible to sterilize them at home ? " 
" That does not work according to my understanding , " Wong responded . 
Chiang had earlier uploaded a video to Facebook showing how she steam cleans her own masks , and in a follow up post she defended the move as a possible last resort , pointing out that materials in the mask could withstand temperatures of over 140 degrees C , meaning 100C should not damage the masks itself . 
According to public broadcaster RTHK , medical sector lawmaker Pierre Chan said the idea was " horrible , " and " will destroy the structure of that surgical mask , it 's very simple . " 
" ( Masks are ) one use only and please , do that , " he said . 
Whether surgical masks can be safely reused has been examined in the past . 
A report published in 2006 from the US Institute of Medicine said it could not find any means of cleaning disposable masks , including more sophisticated respirators , " without increasing the likelihood of infection . "
