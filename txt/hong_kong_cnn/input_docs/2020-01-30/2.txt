Hong Kong customs officials are carrying out a large scale city wide special operation to crack down on stores selling fake surgical masks amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak . 
Officers with the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department have conducted spot checks on almost 200 stores across the city , including pharmacies , chain stores , and other shops that sell the face masks . 
" The spot check operation focused on three aspects of surgical masks , namely false origin claims , non compliance with consumer goods safety standards and false trademarks , " a statement from the customs department said . 
The operation , codenamed " Guardian , " is to ensure masks sold in Hong Kong comply with consumer goods safety standards . 
" Immediate announcements will be made if any irregularities are spotted during the operation , " the statement said . 
The crackdown comes as supplies of face masks are running low in Hong Kong . 
Long lines of residents queueing outside pharmacies and stores are a common sight around the territory . 
Hong Kong has now confirmed 10 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus .
