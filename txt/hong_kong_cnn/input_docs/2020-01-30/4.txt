Jokes about how Wuhan residents can now make a great contribution to China by simply doing nothing and lying on the couch are doing the rounds on Chinese social media . 
There is also a viral video of an elderly woman in Wuhan dumping bags of vegetables into her shopping cart while everyone around her stopped to listen to Premier Li Keqiang giving a short speech at a local supermarket . 
The meme goes that no one can stop Wuhan grannies from getting their groceries , not even the Chinese premier . 
Li visited Wuhan on Monday to inspect the situation on the ground and placate the public amid growing criticism of the government 's handling of the crisis . 
The same evening , residents could be heard shouting " Go , Wuhan ! " and singing China 's national anthem from their high rise buildings , according to videos circulating online . 
The scene echoes similar evening routines in Hong Kong last year during the city 's ongoing pro democracy protests , which began in June . 
Protesters shouted " Go , Hong Kong ! " and sang the protest movement 's anthem from their apartment windows . 
Not all Wuhan residents support the practice , however . 
Counter calls online warned it was too dangerous to shout from apartment windows , as droplets of bodily fluids carrying the coronavirus could be passed from one floor to another as people shouted over balconies .
