Mothers across Hong Kong are giving birth alone as public hospitals in the territory are banning partners from labor wards in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak . 
Dee Cheung , 34 , a Canadian born Hong Kong resident , gave birth to a baby girl at 6pm on Monday , January 27 . 
She found out her husband would not be allowed into the delivery room -- or the labor ward to meet the baby afterward -- when she arrived at hospital . 
Sandra Marco Colino , 42 , a Spaniard who has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years , gave birth via a planned C section at 37 weeks , as she had placenta previa , which can cause severe bleeding during delivery . 
Because her baby girl was just 2.2 kilograms at birth , she had to go to the Special Care Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital . 
While Hong Kong battles the coronavirus outbreak , all parents have been banned from the unit to protect the most vulnerable babies from infection , meaning Colino and her husband did not meet their daughter until she was six days old . 
Colina added that nurses took photographs of their baby in the Special Care Unit and would give them to her husband every day as an update . 
Veronika , went through 30 hours of labor on her own at the Queen Mary Hospital , on Hong Kong Island . 
Kloub 's husband met their baby girl , Aurora , on the street outside the hospital while he gave her some bags to take up to the ward . 
CNN reached out to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority for comment but did not receive a response .
