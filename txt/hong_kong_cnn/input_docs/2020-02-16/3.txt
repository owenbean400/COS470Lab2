The Hong Kong government is arranging a chartered flight to bring its residents , who are under quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship , back home free of charge , once they are permitted to leave . 
A two week quarantine on board the cruise liner is due to end on February 19 . 
However , Japanese officials have said it could take days to complete the disembarkation . 
" Once the Japanese authorities have confirmed the detailed arrangements , the government will inform the affected Hong Kong residents details of the return date and related arrangements as soon as possible , " the city 's security bureau said . 
" Taking into consideration the potential risk on public health , the persons concerned will be arranged to stay at quarantine centre for 14 days upon their arrival in Hong Kong . " 
There are around 330 Hong Kong residents on board , including 260 holding a HKSAR passport and around 70 holding a foreign passport .
