Days after most Americans began life on lockdown , President Donald Trump has already said he wants the nation " opened up and just raring to go " by April 12 . 
That 's just over two weeks away , and most doctors believe far too early for a return to normal , risking another wave of coronavirus infections that could quickly spiral out of control . 
But Trump , along with many prominent US conservatives , is concerned about the effects on the economy -- particularly the markets -- should people be away from work for too long . 
Other governments have tackled with this issue already , with authorities across China moving to bail out affected businesses and provide payments to people living on lockdown , making it easier for them to stay at home and help rein in the outbreak . 
Hong Kong , one of the first places outside mainland China to see infections , also provides a model for what happens when you go back to work too soon . 
This week , the city sent civil servants back home after they returned to their offices around the start of the month . 
Numbers had been stable in Hong Kong when that decision was made , but imported infections combined with a lack of social distancing soon led to a new wave of local cases . 
That experience should cause alarm for anyone advocating a quick return to work in the US . 
New York City alone has 50 times the number of confirmed cases as Hong Kong , even after the new wave of infections . 
Cities in the US are also far less able to control transport in and out , or even keep track of imported infections until they show up at hospitals . 
Trump and his backers in conservative media may be concerned what happens to the stock market if workers are at home for too long , but there 's no reason to suppose the line will go up if they 're in hospitals or morgues instead . 
As Hong Kong has shown , fighting the coronavirus is a long game , and you ca not rush it .
