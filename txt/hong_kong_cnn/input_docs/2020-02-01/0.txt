An estimated 75,815 people in Wuhan , China could be infected with the novel coronavirus as of January 25 , researchers in Hong Kong said . 
Gabriel Leung , one of the authors of study published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet , said the estimates could be much higher than the number of confirmed cases because " not everyone who is infected would require or seek medical attention . " 
Leung , who is the chairman of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong , and the other authors cautioned " that given the lack of a robust and detailed timeline of records of suspected , probable , and confirmed cases and close contacts , the true size of the epidemic and its pandemic potential remains unclear . "
