Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific said in a statement today that it is " appealing to " all 27,000 of its employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave from March to June . 
" In view of the novel coronavirus outbreak and also significant drop in market demand , we just announced massive capacity cuts yesterday , " said the company in a statement . 
A rough year for Cathay : The airline , the city 's flag carrier , has been struggling for more than half a year , hit hard by the political unrest that consumed Hong Kong in the entire second half of 2019 . 
Intense pro democracy , anti government protests saw tourist figures drop dramatically , and Cathay was one of several airlines reporting plummeting business . 
The airline was also dragged into heated controversy after firing an employee , allegedly over a political Facebook post . 
Chinese state media slammed Cathay workers taking part in illegal demonstrations , and the airline vowed to fire employees who are found doing so .
