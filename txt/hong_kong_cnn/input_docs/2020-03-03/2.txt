They 're your furry best friend and a fixture of your home -- but could your beloved cat or dog give you coronavirus ? 
Experts agree , almost definitely not . 
Why then did one dog in Hong Kong test positive for coronavirus last week ? 
Here 's what happened . 
Last Friday , Hong Kong 's Agriculture , Fisheries and Conservation Department ( AFCD ) said that samples from the dog 's nasal and oral cavities had tested " weak positive " for novel coronavirus . 
It was believed to be the first time that a dog anywhere in the world tested positive for the virus . 
The dog -- which had no symptoms -- was put into quarantine and will be repeatedly tested until the result comes back negative , according to the statement . 
The department " strongly advises " that pets of people infected with coronavirus are quarantined for 14 days .

That 's because while dogs can test positive for the virus , it does not necessarily mean they have been infected .
