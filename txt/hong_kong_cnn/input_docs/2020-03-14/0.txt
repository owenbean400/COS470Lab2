Vietnam is suspending travel from certain European countries , according to a government statement issued Saturday . 
The ban will apply to travelers who have been in 26 European countries , known as the Schengen Area , and the UK in the past 14 days . 
Visas upon arrival will also no longer be issued for all foreign nationals , the statement said . 
The travel restrictions come into effect at midnight Sunday local time , and will last 30 days . 
Vietnam has 32 cases of the coronavirus , 16 of which have been discharged from hospital . 
A wave of travel bans : Vietnam 's ban echoes similar ones imposed by the US , Hong Kong , Turkey , Cambodia and other countries in the past few days . 
The US and Hong Kong both implemented bans for the Schengen Area . 
Turkey and Cambodia 's bans did not cover as many countries , and singled out several of the hardest hit European nations , like Spain and Germany .
