Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) to continue its training and improve its combat preparedness amid the ongoing pandemic , according to state broadcaster CCTV . 
Remember : Modernizing the army and enhancing its combat preparedness have been a priority for Xi since he took power in 2013 . 
Xi , who also heads the 2 million strong PLA , acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic has been a " big test " for the military while also creating a " profound impact " on China ’s security and development . 
" It is necessary to adhere to the bottom line thinking , comprehensively strengthen the training of troops and combat preparedness , " said Xi , adding that the military should " resolutely safeguard national sovereignty , security , development interests and the overall strategic stability of the country . " 
Xi echoed previous statements made by Premier Li Keqiang following the announcement of an increased military budget last week when Li said the bigger military budget was needed to protect China ’s " sovereignty , security , development interests . " 
Xi ’s comments come amid growing tensions between the US and China over several issues including trade , Hong Kong , and the coronavirus pandemic .
