Hong Kong will allow groups of up to 50 people to gather starting on Friday as coronavirus restrictions in the city continue to be eased by the government . 
Chan said the government is also lifting the limit on the number of customers allowed per table inside catering and restaurant businesses . 
Chan stressed that restaurants will still need to follow certain rules , such as ensuring tables are at least 1.5 meters apart . 
" Under the suppress and lift strategy , we are now in the lift stage , if the epidemic remains stable , and where public health risks permit , we will try to relax the measures as far as possible , " Chan said . 
The relaxed restrictions will be in effect for two weeks starting on Friday and will cover July 1 , the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong â€™s handover , a day where large scale protests and rallies are usually held .
