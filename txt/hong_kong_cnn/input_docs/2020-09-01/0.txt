At least 615,000 people have registered for Hong Kong 's free mass voluntary Covid 19 testing program , according to the city 's government . 
The mass testing began on Tuesday local time for all residents in the city of 7.5 million . 
Hong Kong 's leader , Carrie Lam , said Tuesday that the government does not have a " quantifiable target " for the number of participants but appealed to the public " to encourage as many citizens to come forward . " 
In a news conference , Lam said that the relatively low number of participants was not a reflection of the government 's popularity , but instead had to do with people not understanding the program -- so " they try to cause worries and fears among the people . " 
" The purpose of the program is to identify hidden carriers as far as possible in order to reduce the spread of the virus , and in turn to cut the transmission route , " Lam said . 
Hong Kong 's testing program has sparked controversy and even boycott , just as the city is battling its third wave of coronavirus .
