Hong Kong had just begun letting its guard down in late February when it was hit by a second wave of the novel coronavirus . 
After a brief period of low case numbers , new infections spiked dramatically , prompting a series of additional stringent restrictions . 
That second wave now appears to have largely passed . 
Hong Kong has not had a case of local transmission in more than two weeks . 
In total , Hong Kong has recorded only 15 new cases since April 20 , all of which were people with recent travel history . 
That brings the city 's total to 1,041 cases and four deaths . 
Of those total cases , 900 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital . 
What Hong Kong did : The coronavirus first emerged in mainland China in December , and jumped the border into Hong Kong on January 24 . 
By then , it had already made its way to several other countries . 
Hong Kong closed borders and began social distancing just a week or so after recording its first case . 
But this three month stretch of working from home , business closures and service suspensions has dealt a massive blow to both the city 's economy and the mental health and wellbeing of residents . 
Now , with the second wave mostly contained , many are itching to get back to pre pandemic life .
