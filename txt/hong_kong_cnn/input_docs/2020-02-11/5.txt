Thailand has confirmed another case of coronavirus , bringing the total number of infections in the country up to 33 . 
The latest patient is a 54 year old Chinese woman who traveled from Wuhan before the city was put on lock down , according to Thailand 's Department of Disease Control . 
The news came as the Thai authorities announced they would not allow the Westerdam to dock outside Bangkok over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus . 
The cruise liner has been stuck at sea for days , with more than 2,000 people on board . 
None of its former or current passengers have been infected with coronavirus , but after the cruise liner stopped in Hong Kong it has been unable to find a country willing to let it dock . 
Holland America said in a statement Monday the ship would dock in Laem Chabang in Thailand on February 13 and that passengers would be allowed to disembark there . 
The company also said all guests on board the Westerdam would be fully refunded and receive future cruise credit . 
However , a senior Thai government official said at a news conference Tuesday that the country 's health authorities are not allowing the ship to dock in Thailand . 
CNN has reached out to Holland America for comment and more information on its proposed route .
