The advice on whether people should wear masks differs from country to country , depending on the severity of the situation in each place and what local health authorities are advising . 
In Hong Kong , for instance , city authorities are advising people wear masks in crowded places like public transport . 
But in the US , officials are advising the opposite . 
" For someone who 's healthy , it 's not going to protect you against the virus , " said CNN Chief Correspondent Sanjay Gupta . 
" It may actually become a reservoir when you 're taking it on , when you 're taking it off . 
You could actually contaminate yourself . 
It traps viral particles . 
It does not do what people think it would do . " 
Here 's who should be wearing masks : People who are actually sick . 
The masks , Gupta said , " may decrease the amount of respiratory droplets coming out of their mouth or nose . " 
Health care workers who are taking care of very sick patients also need masks â€” another reason why people should not panic and buy masks , he said . 
It could cut the supply for these nurses and doctors on the front line against the virus .
