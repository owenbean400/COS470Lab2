On June 18 , Hong Kong Disneyland will become the world 's second Disney park to reopen . 
One of the smallest Disney theme parks , it closed on January 26 due to the global coronavirus crisis and has remained shut since then , with a few exceptions -- namely its hotels and a few on site restaurants . 
Shanghai Disneyland was the first park to reopen , welcoming guests back on May 11 . 
Its reopening gave clues as to what Disney parks around the world would look like post coronavirus , with social distancing regulations enforced and both guests and employees ( aka cast members ) sporting face masks . 
And it looks like Hong Kong Disneyland will follow similar procedures . 
Guests will be required to book reservations online at least one week in advance in order to maintain crowd control . 
Upon arrival , they will have to submit to temperature checks , fill out a health declaration form and wear face masks . 
Magic Access members , who are the park 's annual pass holders , will get priority for booking reservations .
