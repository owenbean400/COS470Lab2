A combination of three antiviral drugs plus an immune system booster seemed to help patients recover more quickly from coronavirus infections , doctors in Hong Kong have reported . 
They said the approach needs more testing but it could offer another treatment possibility for Covid 19 patients . 
Currently the only authorized treatment in the US is the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir , which also shortens the duration of illness but is limited in supply . 
Dr . Peter Chin Hong , who is treating coronavirus patients at the University of California San Francisco , said the study offers new hope in the pandemic . 
Dr . Kwok Yung Yuen at Hong Kong University and colleagues tested the HIV drug combination of ritonavir and lopanivir along with the general antiviral drug ribavirin and a multiple sclerosis drug called beta interferon . 
Yuen 's team gave some patients only the HIV drug combination , often sold under the brand name Kaletra . 
Others were randomly assigned to get the lopinavir ritonavir combination plus the antiviral drug ribavirin and injections of beta interferon . 
The patients who got the cocktail tested negative for coronavirus after seven days on average . 
Those who just got the HIV drugs were positive on average for 12 days , the team reported in the Lancet medical journal . 
The patients given the cocktail also felt better quicker -- within four days .
