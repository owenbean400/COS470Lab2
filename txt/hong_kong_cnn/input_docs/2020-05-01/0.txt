Ahead of expected Labor day protests , Hong Kong â€™s Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the city has been able to withstand the coronavirus pandemic but might not be able to bear a return of political violence . 
Hong Kong was rocked last year by pro democracy , anti government protests with escalating violence and anger on all sides . 
The pandemic has put a damper on protests , but anger in the city has not gone away nor has the protest movement gone completely dormant -- even as restrictions on gatherings and a desire to avoid infection has put a temporary halt to the kind of mass demonstrations seen in 2019 .
