The number of people in Israel instructed to self quarantine over fears of coronavirus has swelled to more than 200 , after a visiting South Korean tour group tested positive for the disease after leaving the country . 
As of Sunday morning , 180 students and 19 teachers from three different schools were under instruction to remain at home , the Education Ministry said . 
The students and teachers had come into close contact with the South Korean tour group at different sites and national parks throughout Israel . 
In addition , 12 Israeli border policemen from the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron will remain under self quarantine , a spokesman for the border police said in a statement . 
The South Korean tour group visited the holy site on February 13 . 
On Saturday , the Ministry of Health said 20 workers of Israel 's Natural Parks Authority who came into contact with the tour group have also been ordered to self quarantine until Wednesday at the earliest . 
That totals at least 231 people in Israel under self quarantine . 
In addition , there are also Israeli citizens under self quarantine who have returned from places such as China , Hong Kong , and Singapore , where a mandatory self quarantine period of 14 days is required . 
There is no official tally of how many of these citizens there are . 
Anyone instructed to self quarantine by Israel 's Health Ministry is forbidden from visiting any public areas , including schools , hospitals , entertainment centers , shopping centers , and public transport . 
Because of concern over the coronavirus and the number of people under self quarantine in the country , Israel is planning to set up special isolated polling stations for the March 2 election . 
The Central Elections Committee is preparing for the possibility of approximately 20 such isolated polling stations for affected voters .
