Hong Kong has banned three international airlines from flying specific routes into the city for two weeks , under a new law aimed at stopping the spread of Covid 19 , the city ’s government said on Friday . 
Flights by the three airlines were found to have one or more Covid positive passengers aboard , according to the statement . 
They are : An incoming flight from Amsterdam operated by KLM Dutch Royal airlines on November 27 . 
A flight from Kathmandu to Hong Kong operated by Nepal Airlines on December 1 . 
Two flights to Hong Kong from Dubai via Bangkok operated by Emirates on December 2 . 
Under strict new rules , the Hong Kong government is prohibiting the airlines from flying those routes into the city for 14 days . 
What triggered the bans ? 
Passengers test positive : The ban is enforceable when an airline carries more than five Covid 19 positive passengers . 
The Nepal Airlines flight on December 1 had six passengers test positive on arrival . 
Consecutive flights : The ban is also enforceable on an airline which operates two consecutive flights into Hong Kong carrying Covid 19 positive passengers . 
This was the case with the Emirates flights , which brought four cases to Hong Kong on December 2 and three cases on December 3 . 
Failure to comply with measures : The flight operated by KLM from Amsterdam to Hong Kong on November 27 only had one Covid 19 positive passenger , but was also added to the 14 day blacklist . 
The Hong Kong government said it reserves the right to block the route for 14 days if a passenger on board an aircraft carrying Covid 19 fails to comply with pandemic control measures . 
KLM ’s Amsterdam Hong Kong and Nepal Airlines ’ Kathmandu route will be put out of action until December 17 , while Emirates will be unable to fly into Hong Kong from Dubai or Bangkok until December 18 , the Hong Kong government said .
