Student Andrew Sutton asks CNN 's town hall if someone in an apartment building gets Covid 19 , can the virus spread to other units through the plumbing or vents , like SARS did ? 
Dr . Leana Wen , the former Baltimore health commissioner , said currently there is no evidence that the coronavirus can spread long distances . 
However , she added that the virus could spread through a defective plumbing system . 
This was a particular concern in Hong Kong . 
During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak , this method became a major source of transmission . 
At the Amoy Gardens housing estate , there were more than 300 infections and 42 deaths after defective plumbing allowed the virus to spread through the building . 
Dr . Wen also recommended opening the windows to increase your own ventilation once the weather gets warmer and to wash your hands thoroughly after touching surfaces that are used often , like handrails or buttons in elevators .
