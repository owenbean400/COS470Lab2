Hong Kong and Singapore will launch a new " air travel bubble , " on November 22 , a scheme that will allow residents to travel between the two Asian hubs without requiring quarantine or restrictive control measures . 
At first , the air travel bubble , or ATB , will allow one flight a day into each city , with a maximum of 200 travelers per flight , Singapore â€™s civil aviation authority said Wednesday . 
By December 7 , the bubble will allow two flights a day into each city , with each flight carrying a maximum of 200 travelers , they said . 
People hoping to fly between the two cities will have to meet certain parameters before doing so , such as no travel history in the previous 14 days . 
They will also have to undergo compulsory Covid 19 testing before flying . 
The Civil Aviation of Singapore called the program a " milestone arrangement " that " seeks to revive air travel in a safe and progressive way . " 
They did , however , caution that should the situation deteriorate in either city , the ATB will be suspended . 
The launch of the ATB , coupled with the small amount of Covid 19 infections in Singapore and Hong Kong reflect a remarkable turnaround after both places had both experienced soaring infection numbers earlier this year .
