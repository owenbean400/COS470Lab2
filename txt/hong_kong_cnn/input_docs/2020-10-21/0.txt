Cathay Pacific Group , the owner of Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific , is cutting 5,900 jobs across its global workforce in a bid to stay afloat , the company said Wednesday . 
Cathay is just one of many airlines across the world that have been decimated by the Covid 19 pandemic , as anti epidemic measures have forced travelers to stay home . 
The company said it would shutter its regional carrier , Cathay Dragon , and lay off 5,300 employees based in Hong Kong . 
About 600 employees based outside of Hong Kong are likely to be affected " subject to local regulatory requirements , " the company said in a statement . 
Tang said that in spite of these efforts , the company was burning through up to 2 billion Hong Kong dollars ( about $ 260 million ) in cash each month , which was " simply unsustainable . " 
He said the changes announced today would reduce those expenditures by about 500 million Hong Kong dollars ( $ 65 million ) per month . 
Tang said Cathay expects to operate at just 25 % of its 2019 capacity in the first half of next year , and less than 50 % for the entirety of 2021 .
