Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam arrived at press conference today wearing a surgical face mask , alongside several other members of her senior team . 
Just a few months ago , the sight of government officials wearing masks would have been unthinkable -- for a very different reason . 
Today 's press conference , and the officials ' decision to wear masks , come as the Hong Kong government look to step up efforts to enforce better public health measures . 
As of today , there are eight confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Hong Kong . 
At the press conference , Lam announced additional measures including restricted travel across the Chinese border . 
Masks in a different context : But a little over three months ago , in early October , Lam had invoked colonial era emergency powers to ban people from wearing face masks in public assemblies as anti government , pro democracy protests rocked the city . 
Protesters often wore face masks , as well as helmets and goggles , to obscure their identity and protect against tear gas when battling riot police on the streets . 
For the entire second half of 2019 , face masks were a symbol of the city 's political crisis , and a statement on where you stood . 
When Lam announced the face mask ban , she said it would help " stop violence and restore calm to society , " and act as a deterrent for protesters .
