The Hong Kong government has announced that government workers will be allowed to work from home when the Chinese New Year holiday ends on Wednesday . 
The directive excludes emergency service workers and people who work for essential public services . 
The private sector has also been urged to make similar arrangements , a government spokesman said . 
There have been numerous calls within Hong Kong for the city to close its border with China , and attempts to convert unoccupied apartment buildings in the northern town of Fanling to a quarantine center were met by fierce protests , eventually forcing them to be abandoned .
