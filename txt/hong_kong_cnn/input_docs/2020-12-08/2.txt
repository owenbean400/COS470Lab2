Hong Kong has announced new measures to suppress the flow of people amid a fourth wave of Covid 19 in the city . 
Starting on Thursday , restaurants will only be allowed to provide takeaway services between 6 p.m . and 5 a.m . the following day , Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan announced during a press conference . 
Restaurants will be capped at 50 % of total seating capacity , while gyms , swimming pools , and sports centers will have to close until at least December 23 , Chan added . 
The new measures come as Hong Kong reported another 100 Covid 19 cases on Tuesday , of which 95 were locally transmitted . 
Chan also announced that the government had approved a legal framework that will give it the power to order individuals to remain at a location when they wait to receive their Covid 19 test results . 
The government will also arrange coaches to transfer all international travelers arriving in Hong Kong from outside of mainland China , Macau , and Taiwan to designated quarantine hotels to minimize the risk of community transmission , Chan said . 
Travelers will also be required to conduct a test either on day 19 or 20 after their arrival to " ensure that even in the rare situation where the incubation period of the virus exceeds that of the quarantine period , nobody will be allowed to go undetected , " she added .
