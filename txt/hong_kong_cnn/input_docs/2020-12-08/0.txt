Hong Kong is imposing tougher anti epidemic measures as new cases continue to rise as part of the city 's so called fourth wave . 
The government will announce a 6 p.m . dining curfew for restaurants and will close gyms , sports centers , and beauty salons , Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a regular news briefing Tuesday . 
Lam said people are not sticking to social distancing measures and the new restrictions are to " curb the number of people on the streets and reduce the flow of people . " 
Covid 19 infections have been rising in Hong Kong since the end of November , and the city is now reporting dozens of new cases each day . 
Many of those are linked to a dance club cluster , which now includes more than 650 cases . 
In total , Hong Kong has reported more than 6,900 coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic , including 112 deaths . 
Lam said Tuesday that Hong Kong 's new cases are at " a record high " and nearing the peak of the last wave in July . 
One third of the total number of recent cases are from untraceable sources , Lam said . 
The exact restrictions will be announced later , Lam said , as she appealed to members of the public to suspend all social events , parties and meal gatherings .
