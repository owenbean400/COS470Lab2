Yesterday , health officials in Hong Kong partially evacuated residents from an apartment block over fears the coronavirus may have been transmitted via the building 's pipes . 
Two residents living on different floors of the building had been infected , health officials said . 
Three more cases have since been linked to the same building . 
This has happened before : During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak , pipes became a major source of transmission . 
At one housing estate , there were more than 300 infections and 42 deaths after defective plumbing allowed the virus to spread through the building . 
Investigation underway : Scientists believe the coronavirus is mainly transmitted by direct contact -- such as touching someone 's hand -- and through droplets , like when an infected person coughs on someone else . 
But because the two patients lived directly above one another , and the initial inspection found that a pipe had been disconnected from the bathroom 's waste pipe , authorities decided to investigate whether the virus could have spread through the building 's sewage system . 
Microbiologist Yuen Kwok yung said at a news conference today that an improperly sealed pipe could have resulted in a virus transmission , by carrying infected feces into the building 's ventilation system and blowing the virus into people 's bathrooms . 
How to protect yourself : While the investigation into the building continues , Hong Kong 's Center for Health Protection has advised the public to maintain drainage pipes by regularly pouring water into drain outlets and to put the toilet lid down before flushing " to avoid spreading germs . "
