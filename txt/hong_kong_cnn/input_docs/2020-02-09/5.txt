Hong Kong 's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said tourism and retail sectors would likely take a big hit as visitor numbers from mainland China dramatically fall in the viral outbreak . 
The impact on the Hong Kong economy could be worse than SARS was in 2003 . 
" The actual impact of this epidemic on Hong Kong 's economy depends on its development , but I believe that the outlook is not optimistic and is likely to be a stronger impact than the that of SARS in 2003 , " he wrote on his blog . 
" In terms of internal factors , mainland visitors now account for 78 % of all visitors to Hong Kong , a percentage much higher than 41 % in 2002 . 
In recent years , tourism accounts for 32 % of Hong Kong 's total service industry output , which is higher than 21 % during the SARS period . 
Therefore , if the tourism and retail industry continue to weaken , there will be a more significant impact on our economy . "
