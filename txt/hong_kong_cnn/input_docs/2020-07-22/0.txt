Hong Kong will require all individuals to wear a face mask in all public indoor areas as it battles the third wave of Covid 19 , Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said Wednesday . 
While masks are currently required in public transport , the requirement will be extended to all public indoor areas , bus interchange and terminal stations , she said . 
The new regulations will take effect on Thursday , and offenders may face a maximum penalty of US$645 ( HK$5,000 ) . 
In addition , the city will require air travelers from nine high risk countries -- including the United States and Kazakhstan -- to show negative results in nucleic acid tests within 72 hours of their flight , she added . 
Chan said the additional measures are needed as the city has reported 605 locally transmitted cases in the past 14 days . 
She said the coming two weeks will be critical .
