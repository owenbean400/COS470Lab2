Hong Kong 's Polytechnic University has developed new face masks that could be reusable for up to 70 times , according to local reports . 
Lawmaker Felix Chung told CNN the project was led by both the university and the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel . 
Researchers are working to develop a new antibacterial material that could be used in various textile products -- including face masks . 
They are producing samples , which will hopefully be ready by Monday , Chung said . 
Once the samples are ready , the teams can gauge whether they are ready for public distribution . 
A different battle : The university may be at the forefront of the global fight against the outbreak -- but just a few months ago , it was a smoldering battleground , wrecked by fire and tear gas in a very different fight . 
The university became a significant protest site during anti government , pro democracy unrest that rocked Hong Kong during the entire second half of 2019 . 
Protesters in November occupied the university for more than a week , and fought off riot police laying siege to the campus . 
Images at the time showed building entrances on fire , petrol bombs , makeshift weapons like bows and arrows , and clouds of tear gas . 
It also became a powerful symbol of the conflict : young , angry Hong Kongers on a school campus , some declaring they were ready to give their lives to win the city greater freedoms .
