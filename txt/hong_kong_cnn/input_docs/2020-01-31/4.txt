The Hong Kong police force issued a statement earlier today urging the public not to believe online rumors and pledging support for the community . 
The statement read : City authorities have urged residents to avoid handshakes and close contact with people as they work to contain the virus . 
School has been suspended for the week , with many businesses closing temporarily or employees told to work from home . 
A divided city : The police 's pledge to " join hands " with the public may also ring hollow for those who have spent the past eight months clashing with those very officers . 
Hong Kong was thrown into political chaos and violence last June by anti government , pro democracy protests . 
For months , the city was consumed with heated battles between protesters and police . 
Some protesters accuse officers of excessive force and police brutality -- allegations the force strongly denies .
