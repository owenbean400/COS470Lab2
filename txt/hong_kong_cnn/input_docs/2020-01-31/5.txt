In a press conference early Friday evening , Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged residents to stay vigilant and announced further measures by the government to contain the spread of the coronavirus . 
Here are the highlights : The numbers : There are now 12 confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong , five of which are Hong Kong residents and seven are mainland Chinese residents , Lam said . 
School suspended : Primary and secondary schools were originally set to resume on February 17 , but will now stay suspended until March 2 . 
The government will re evaluate at that point whether to resume classes , depending on the status of the outbreak . 
Stay at home : Lam urged students and employees of suspended businesses to stay home instead of using the free time to go outside -- the point of these suspensions is " social distancing , " to diminish crowds and gatherings . 
Border crossings : Lam had announced travel restrictions and some border closings earlier this week . 
The number of arrivals from mainland China across different border points had dropped 91 % since two weeks ago , she said today . 
Additional measures : Lam said the city government had adopted measures like early identification and close tracking of infected patients , but would continue adopting measures suggested by the World Health Organization , like selective screening at international borders . 
Travel warning : Lam urged Hong Kong residents not to visit the mainland , warning that " this will increase the risk of being infected . "
