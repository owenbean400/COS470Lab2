Medical workers in Hong Kong have ended their strike after members voted not to extend it . 
Thousands of workers have been on strike for five days , demanding that the Hong Kong government close all borders with mainland China and take further emergency measures against the virus . 
In a press statement released on Friday , the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said that more than 7,000 members voted in a poll to decide whether to continue the strike and 4,000 members voted against it . 
Over the past five days , the union has organized a medical sector strike that has heavily impacted services across the city . 
On Wednesday alone , over 7,000 employees took part accounting for nearly 10 % of all public sector medical workers in the city . 
For most of the week , public hospitals have had limited services due to the strike . 
Remaining staff members have had to focus efforts on emergency services , so patients with mild conditions were advised to find private hospitals or clinics instead . 
Meanwhile , Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has implemented emergency measures such as mandatory quarantines for travelers coming from China , and closed all but three of Hong Kong 's mainland China border crossings .
