Hong Kong has reported a new cluster of locally transmitted coronavirus cases -- the first in more than two weeks . 
The cluster consists of nine new cases , the city 's leader Carrie Lam said today . 
Three of the new patients have been identified as workers at the same food logistics warehouse . 
The other six came into contact with one of those workers . 
What happened : Sunday 's positive diagnosis of a 34 year old woman who works at the Kerry Logistics warehouse in the New Territories neighborhood of Kwai Chung led to the eight further positive tests , including her husband , four neighbors , two of her colleagues and a paramedic who assisted her , according to Hong Kong 's Centre For Health Protection . 
The warehouse serves consumer brands , including Marks & Spencer . 
The concern : The woman had no recent travel history and it is unknown where she contracted the coronavirus , making this cluster the first locally transmitted cases in 16 days . 
Hong Kong now has 1,094 total coronavirus cases , with four known deaths . 
CNN has reached out to Marks & Spencer to comment on measures to combat the apparent outbreak . 
Earlier this year , the British company was forced to close all its Hong Kong stores and its corporate office in the city after three employees tested positive .
