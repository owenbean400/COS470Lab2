A hospital in Hong Kong accidentally put a 62 year old coronavirus patient in the wrong room , causing concern that she may have infected others . 
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority 's director of quality and safety , Dr . Chung Kin lai , apologized for the mistake Saturday morning . 
Chung said the woman was put in the wrong ward , which did not have negative room pressure -- a feature designed to stop the spread of germs . 
" We want to apologize for this incident and the imperfect handling , " he said . 
The hospital , located in the district of Tuen Mun , is now assessing whether other patients have been put at risk and the extent of that risk .
