Mass contact tracing should be the " next national mission " in the UK ’s battle with coronavirus , former health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote Tuesday . 
In an opinion piece for the Times of London , Hunt said : " We need every arm of the state , every spare civil servant , every local government town planner and every furloughed administrator turning their hand to the task " of contact tracing . 
Hunt wrote : " The reason why the countries with the lowest death rates have generally been the biggest testers is because of what testing makes possible : quarantining of people with the virus , tracking down who they have been near , and if necessary isolating them as well . " 
" Do this on a massive scale and you can keep open shops , offices and restaurants - as has happened in South Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong - with much less damage to the economy than European or American style mass lockdowns . " 
Hunt , who is now chairman of the UK ’s Health Select Committee which scrutinizes the government , said that by the time the UK ’s lockdown is reviewed again in two weeks contact tracing needs to be a " viable option . "
