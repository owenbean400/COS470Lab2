Hong Kong will require all arriving travelers from foreign countries to be quarantined for 14 days at home , Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced during a weekly press briefing today . 
The city will also issue a red outbound travel alert on all foreign countries with the exception of mainland China , Taiwan , and Macao , she said . 
Currently , Hong Kong requires anyone traveling from mainland China to the city to self quarantine at home for 14 days . 
The new measures will take effect on Thursday , and will affect both residents and non residents . 
Rise in imported cases : This comes as the number of imported cases have risen in recent days . 
In the past two weeks , 50 of the 57 new cases reported have been imported to Hong Kong from overseas , Lam said . 
The city now has a total of 157 cases . 
Lam urged travelers to practice personal hygiene and wear face masks during the journey , and said the government would provide airlines with masks to prevent a possible shortage . 
She also spoke about extending existing measures as the pandemic stretches on ; schools have been closed for months now , and are unlikely to fully reopen in the next month as previously planned , Lam said .
