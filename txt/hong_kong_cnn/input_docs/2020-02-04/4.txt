Months of violent protests and a bruising US China trade war pushed Hong Kong into a recession last year for the first time in a decade . 
Now the coronavirus outbreak threatens to derail things once again . 
Officials said yesterday Hong Kong 's economy shrank 1.2 % last year as massive protests paralyzed the city 's streets and scared away tourists . 
GDP shrank 2.9 % in the fourth quarter alone . 
Hopes dashed : There were signs that 2020 might be better -- diminishing protests , and an initial trade deal -- but then the outbreak happened . 
It has spurred the city government to cancel school for weeks , and order civil servants to work from home . 
Retail stores , theme parks , cultural attractions and other hotspots remain closed . 
Tourism hit : The protests already took a heavy toll on the tourism industry : The number of people who visited Hong Kong in November plunged by nearly half compared to a year earlier . 
The coronavirus outbreak will likely exacerbate that problem . 
Most of Hong Kong 's visitors come from mainland China , where many cities have placed their residents on lockdown . 
Hong Kong has also closed nearly all of its border crossings into the mainland in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading .
