In Hong Kong , mask wearing will be compulsory in all indoor and outdoor public spaces from Wednesday midnight until August 4 , authorities announced on Monday . 
Hong Kong Chief Secretary Mathew Cheung announced four new social restrictions as the city struggles to contain its locally dubbed " third wave " of Covid 19 infections . 
On Monday , the city recorded its sixth straight day of over 100 local cases . 
Failure to comply with the mask ordinance may result in a fine up to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars ( $ 645 ) . 
People with " reasonable excuses " such as medical conditions or children under two will be exempt . 
Dining at restaurants is also banned , though they can still provide takeout services . 
Group gatherings in public will be limited to no more than two people -- down from four previously -- and premises with " high risk of infections " such as swimming pools and sports venues will be shut . 
He added Hong Kong has been using the correct strategy to deal with the virus -- a " lift and suppress " method based on expert advice and scientific evidence . 
Cheung said the city is facing a high risk of community outbreak and urged people to reduce social interaction as much as possible . 
The coming two to three weeks are critical for containing the outbreak , he said . 
When asked about the possibility of a lockdown , Cheung said the measure would cause too much inconvenience and difficulty . 
He said he believed the current measures are " appropriate . " 
As of Monday , Hong Kong has recorded a total number of 2,778 Covid 19 cases and 20 related deaths .
