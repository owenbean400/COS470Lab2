Hong Kong 's hospital union will expand its strike on Tuesday , following a breakdown in negotiations with the government and the organization on Monday night . 
The expanded strike actions will now include all members of the union willing to go on strike as opposed to the strike on Monday which was only comprised of non emergency personnel . 
The union previously asked the government to meet demands including stopping all travelers from entering Hong Kong from mainland China , implementing measures to ensure the supply of face masks , providing isolation wards and sufficient support for staff working in them , and investigating reports of patients escaping hospitals . 
After Chief Executive Carrie Lam ’s press conference on Monday , union spokesperson Winnie Yu said the ports that remain open in Hong Kong – the International Airport , Shenzhen Bay , and Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge – still account for nearly 60 % of all inbound mainland travelers . 
Yu added that under Article 27 of the Hong Kong Basic Law residents shall have freedom of speech and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions , and to strike .
