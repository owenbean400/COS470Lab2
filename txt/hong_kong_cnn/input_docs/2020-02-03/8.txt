Hong Kong 's hospital authority ( HA ) urged healthcare workers to return to work after they began a strike Monday in response to the government 's handling of the Wuhan coronavirus . 
In a statement released Monday , the HA called " all healthcare workers participating in industrial action to return to work as soon as possible to avoid further affecting public hospital services and patient treatment . " 
Hong Kong 's main public hospital medical workers union began a strike Monday with at least 2,400 people participating in the first day , according to Hospital Authority Employee Alliance union 's Facebook page . 
The union previously asked the government to meet demands including stopping all travelers from entering Hong Kong from mainland China , implementing measures to ensure the supply of face masks , providing isolation wards and sufficient support for staff working in them , and investigating reports of patients escaping hospitals .
