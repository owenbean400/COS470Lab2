At CNN 's ongoing town hall , we 're taking audience questions and answering them with medical experts weighing in . 
One viewer asked : What supplies should I get in case my community locks down ? 
Here 's what Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , had to say : Extra medication in case you ca not get refills Bottled water Canned food But he and CNN 's Anderson Cooper acknowledged that sometimes health insurance does not allow for extra medication . 
" We 're looking at relieving a lot of regulations and other things to make it easier for people to cope with this .. really somebody should look at that , " Fauci said . 
People have been panic buying : Stores have sold out of face masks , hand sanitizer , food staples , and more . 
The cleaning supplies can be good to have , especially soap and sanitizer — but one unusual item selling out is toilet paper . 
It 's not entirely clear what is driving the panic buying of toilet paper . 
The trend began in Hong Kong last month after rumors that border closures would cut off the supply from China — but the rumors were dispelled by the government , and there do not appear to be any similar rumors in the US .
