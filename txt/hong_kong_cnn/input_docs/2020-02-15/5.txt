All asymptomatic residents of a Hong Kong public housing building can return home on Sunday after their quarantine ends , the government said today . 
The building was partially evacuated this week after four residents on different floors tested positive for the virus . 
About 100 residents then tested negative for the virus , and were transferred to quarantine centers . 
The four patients : A 62 year old female resident was confirmed with the virus about a week and a half after a 75 year old man in the same building became infected . 
The woman 's son and daughter in law , who live with her , were confirmed with the virus soon after . 
Transmission through pipes : The cases set off alarm bells among health officials that the virus could have been transmitted through pipes in the building . 
In densely populated Hong Kong this could lead to hundreds of people becoming infected in the supposed safety of their own homes . 
The authorities said today they have finished cleaning and disinfecting the building , including the apartments of the confirmed cases . 
They have also adjusted a vent pipe in the female patient 's apartment after it was found to have been altered without authorization .
