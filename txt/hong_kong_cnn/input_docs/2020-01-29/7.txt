Tourism in the semi autonomous Chinese territory of Macao has dropped by 73.6 % from 2019 to 2020 amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak , according to statistics released by the government on Wednesday . 
Chinese mainland tourists represent the bulk of the drop , with a 79.6 % fall since 2019 . 
Macao is known for its casinos , which mainland tourists usually visit during the Chinese New Year since gambling is illegal in the mainland . 
But Chinese New Year -- which took place this past weekend -- was hit hard , with many choosing to stay home instead of traveling on holiday or to visit friends and family , for fear of being infected or spreading the virus . 
The local government is also barring entry to those who have been to Hubei in the last 14 days . 
Hong Kong : Macao is not the only nearby city to restrict travel -- Hong Kong , also a semi autonomous Chinese territory , announced it would close some of its borders with the mainland . 
The new border controls are expected to take place Thursday . 
Carrie Lam , the city 's Chief Executive , claim they would eventually reduce mainland Chinese visitors by 80 % . 
But many in the city -- including medical workers and some lawmakers -- say it 's not enough , and demand a full border shutdown and ban on Chinese tourists until the virus has been contained .
