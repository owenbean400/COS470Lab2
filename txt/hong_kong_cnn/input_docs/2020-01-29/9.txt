John Nicholls , a clinical professor at Hong Kong University , is part of the team investigating the coronavirus in Hong Kong . 
He weighs in on the outbreak : Testing for coronavirus : Just because a person tests negative for coronavirus , does not mean they wo not contract it in the future , Nicholls said . 
It â€™s possible a person could test negative , and then need to be tested again later . 
Virus in hospital : If the spread of the coronavirus is anything like the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak , it could spread " extensively " within hospitals , Nicholls said . 
If doctors do not decontaminate medical instruments or equipment -- even something as simple as a stethoscope -- that 's one way the virus could spread . 
" Hidden mortality " : Not all people who die during an outbreak are infected with the disease . 
During outbreaks like these , hospitals often no longer had the capacity to care for patients with unrelated illnesses . 
During SARS , Hong Kong hospitals temporarily halted elective surgeries because doctors were too stretched . 
This means there is a " hidden mortality " from people who missed their surgeries or appointments , Nicholls said .
