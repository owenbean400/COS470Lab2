Asian low cost airline HK Express is temporarily suspending all flights scheduled for March 23 to April 30 due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
The carrier , which was acquired by Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific last year , said in a news release that its decision was made " in light of the significant drop in travel demand " amid growing travel restrictions imposed by Hong Kong and various other governments across the world to curb the spread of the virus . 
" Given all the challenges we have been facing , preserving our cash position is key to make sure we stay together as team , " CEO Mandy Ng said .
