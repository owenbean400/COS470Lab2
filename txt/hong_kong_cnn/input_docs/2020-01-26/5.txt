Hong Kong is facing a serious shortage of face masks after fears over the Wuhan coronavirus sparked a surge in demand . 
Horace Lau , vice president of Hong Kong â€™s General Chamber of Pharmacies , told CNN the next batch of face masks was not expected to arrive in the city until February . 
" The supply of face masks during the Lunar New Year is highly uncertain , " he said . 
Hong Kong imports most of its face masks from China , Taiwan and Malaysia , Lau added -- so if China stops exports , supply will be even tighter . 
Deliveries could also be affected by the Lunar New Year holiday in both China and Hong Kong . 
Lau said that in his own shop he had sold over 10,000 boxes of 50 face masks in the last week alone . 
The price of face masks in pharmacies has already started to rise , he added .
