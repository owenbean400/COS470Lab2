Yesterday was the first day of the Lunar New Year , the Year of the Rat . 
For many Chinese people , the holiday is a once a year chance to share a meal and carry bags of gifts from the cities to their families back home . 
This year , it was originally expected that 3 billion journeys would be made during " chunyun , " or spring rush -- the 40 day period from January 9 to February 18 when people travel for Lunar New Year . 
But celebrations were considerably smaller this year , as authorities across mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao canceled many large public gatherings in order to help contain the Wuhan coronavirus . 
Eva Kwang , 35 , was at Hong Kong 's West Kowloon Station on Friday to cancel her family 's train tickets to Guangzhou , in southern Guangdong province . 
She said she was sad that she could not see her family , but was worried about her two children . 
" I think the safety for us is more important than my dinner with them , " she told CNN . 
" I think I can go back and visit them after maybe one month or two months . "
