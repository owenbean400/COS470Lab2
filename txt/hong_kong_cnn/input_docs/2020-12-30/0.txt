A group representing some 400 Hong Kong citizens and residents currently in the United Kingdom have written to the city ’s government begging for it to rescind a ban on entry from the country introduced after a new , potentially more infectious variant of the coronavirus was detected in the UK . 
In a letter to the Hong Kong government , seen by CNN , the group said the " regulatory amendments , announced at understandably short notice , have severely impacted many of us . " 
They requested that the Hong Kong government publicly announce a date for the ban to be rescinded , giving them a degree of certainty on when to book flights and hotel accommodation for quarantine stays , or to open a travel window to allow those currently overseas who hold Hong Kong residence to return to the city . 
The Chief Executive ’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN . 
In an email seen by CNN to the group , a spokeswoman for the Chief Executive said the new variant in the UK had forced the government " to make a resolute move to halt further importation . " 
Multiple governments around the world have temporarily banned entry from the UK over the new coronavirus variant . 
A ban in France -- which has now been eased -- caused chaos earlier this month when thousands of heavy duty vehicles were stranded at the UK ’s border on the English Channel .
