Cathay Pacific Airways is laying off hundreds of cabin crew in the United States , as demand collapses because of the coronavirus pandemic . 
The Hong Kong carrier said Friday that it is shutting down cabin crew bases in New York , San Francisco and Los Angeles , effectively laying off 286 staff . 
Like all global airlines , Cathay has been hard hit by restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries in an effort to curb the transmission of Covid 19 . 
The measures have led to a collapse in demand for air travel . 
Cathay said in an email to customers on Thursday that it has reduced passenger capacity by 97 % across its network for the month of April . 
Pandemic forces airline industry into crisis : On Tuesday , the International Air Transport Association said that it now expects worldwide losses due to the coronavirus to top $ 314 billion , higher than the $ 252 billion in losses it had forecast just weeks earlier . 
The aviation group said travel worldwide has plummeted by 80 % , much deeper than its earlier predictions .
