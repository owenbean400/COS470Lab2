Yesterday , preliminary research found that a 33 year old man in Hong Kong had contracted Covid 19 twice this year , having fallen ill 142 days after being infected the first time . 
Ivan Hung , part of the research team at the University of Hong Kong , said the study " underscores the importance of having an annual coronavirus vaccine to boost immunity even if you recovered from a natural infection . " 
The second or third infection will likely be less severe than the first , unless the patient is elderly or immunocompromised , he added . 
Vaccine development : More than 30 vaccine candidates are now in varying stages of clinical development and Phase 1 , 2 or 3 clinical trials , according to the World Health Organization . 
The race to find an effective vaccine has global implications , not just for the health of billions of people , but potential billions in revenue for the successful developer and manufacturer .
