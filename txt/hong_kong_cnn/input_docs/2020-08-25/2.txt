Hong Kong will relax some coronavirus restrictions starting Friday , as daily new cases begin to drop after several weeks of combating a third wave of infection . 
Current social distancing measures will be extended for two more days before loosening , Hong Kong Secretary of Food and Health Sophia Chan announced today . 
Dine in services at restaurants will be extended until 9 p.m . instead of the current 6 p.m . , while cinemas , beauty parlors and some outdoor sports premises will reopen , Chan said . 
Face masks will also no longer be mandatory when exercising or in country parks . 
Third wave : Hong Kong recorded nine new cases of Covid 19 on Monday , marking the lowest daily number of cases since July 3 . 
The past month has seen a third wave of infections sweep the city ; daily case counts skyrocketed from single to triple digits . 
The third wave saw restrictions , which had been gradually lifting , slam back down . 
No more than two people are allowed to gather in public , and restaurants can only seat a maximum of two people at one table . 
But it 's still too early to relax : Hong Kong Director of Health Constance Chan added that the community infection chain has not been completely cut off , as around 30-40 % of cases are from unknown sources .
