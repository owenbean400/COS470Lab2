Cleaning robots , temperature checks and antimicrobial coatings could soon become synonymous with airport trips . 
Hong Kong airport has provided a glimpse into what international airport procedures might look like once we 're traveling again -- and a lot of disinfection technologies are involved . 
Officials at the Asian destination 's international airport claim it is the first in the world to trial a live operation of CLean Tech , a full body disinfection booth . 
How it works : Those passing through undertake a temperature check before entering a booth for the 40 second disinfection and sanitizing procedures . 
The individual is also sprinkled with sanitizing spray for " instant disinfection " inside the booth , which is kept under negative pressure , to prevent cross contamination . 
Kills viruses on clothing : According to the airport authority , the inside of the facility contains an antimicrobial coating that can remotely kill any viruses and/or bacteria found on clothing , and the body , by using photocatalyst advances along with " nano needles . " 
Is it in operation ? 
While CLean Tech is at present only being used on staff who undertake public health and quarantine duties for passenger arrivals , the fact that it 's being trialed at one of the world 's busiest airports suggests facilities like this may be used more widely in the near future .
