Hong Kong has extended the suspension of school classes until at least March 16 due to the novel coronavirus , Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung said at a news conference on Thursday . 
Schools were previously suspended until March 2 , but that start date has been delayed for an additional two weeks due to the virus outbreak . 
Yeung said there â€™s " no urgency " for students staying in mainland China or other places to return to the city , and the government is " considering different options for students from mainland China . " 
Students will still be able to complete their work through e learning platforms , despite the suspension . 
The semi autonomous Chinese city has reported at least 50 cases of the coronavirus , and one death .
