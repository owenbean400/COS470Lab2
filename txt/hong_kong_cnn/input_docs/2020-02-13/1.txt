Another 242 people died from the novel coronavirus in Hubei province on Wednesday , and 14,840 new cases were recorded -- a huge spike in confirmed infections . 
At least 1,355 people have now died in mainland China from novel coronavirus , with 1,310 deaths in Hubei alone . 
One person has also died in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines . 
A new way of counting cases : The huge rise in confirmed cases comes from a tweak in how the authorities are tallying infections . 
The government is now including " clinically diagnosed cases " -- i.e . people diagnosed on the basis of their symptoms rather than testing positive -- to make it easier for those patients to access treatment . 
The numbers in Hubei : The epicenter of the outbreak has now recorded 48,206 cases . 
Of those , 33,693 patients have been hospitalized and 1,437 are in critical condition , according to the health authority . 
Meanwhile , 3,441 patients have recovered and been discharged . 
The global tally : The global number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases has now exceeded 60,015 , with the vast majority of cases in mainland China . 
China ’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China ’s provinces later .
