United Airlines said on Wednesday that it will extend the suspension of flights to China and Hong Kong until April 24 . 
The destinations affected are Beijing , Chengdu , Shanghai and Hong Kong . 
Global airlines cut flights : United is just one of many major international airlines that have suspended , reduced , or entirely withdrawn routes to China and its territories due to the coronavirus outbreak and a fall in demand . 
Delta and American Airlines , two of the largest US airlines , also canceled flights . 
American announced its decision last month after a union representing 15,000 pilots sued the company to immediately halt its US China service , citing " serious , and in many ways still unknown , health threats posed by the coronavirus . "
