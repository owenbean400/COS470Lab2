Disney ’s executive chairman Bob Iger admitted that the coronavirus outbreak has been " challenging " for the company , but that it 's strong enough to weather any downturn . 
" I think it ’s fair to say that we ’re all sobered by the concern that we feel for everyone effected by this global crisis , " the former CEO said at Disney ’s annual investor conference . 
How Disney has responded to coronavirus : Disney closed its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January , warning that profits from its facilities in China could drop by $ 280 million in the current quarter . 
The company has also temporarily shuttered its parks in Japan . 
" Our future has always been bright , and it remains so for good reason , " Iger added . 
" In fact , when you think about the world today , what we create at the Walt Disney Co . has never been more necessary or more important . "
