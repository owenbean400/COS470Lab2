In Hong Kong , face masks are ubiquitous . 
Nearly everyone wears masks when they go out on the streets -- a visual representation of the city 's widespread , intense efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic . 
But there is also rising friction as people warn against complacency and the possibility of a second wave of cases . 
Earlier this week , the front page of the influential local newspaper Apple Daily criticized expatriates gathering in a bar without masks . 
The story tapped into a widespread perception among many Hong Kongers , whether true or not , that some of the city 's foreign residents have not shared their alarm at the outbreak . 
The trauma of SARS : Many foreigners living in the city today did not experience the 2003 SARS outbreak , which has cast a long shadow over the current response , and made Hong Kongers far more wary and willing to take extreme precautions . 
Some residents were frustrated at the attitude of a minority of expatriates , including some bosses and colleagues , who belittled or mocked the emergency measures being put in place -- such as wearing masks everywhere or working from home -- ignoring the painful lessons that their locally born colleagues had learned from SARS . 
The privilege of escape : There was also a feeling that many foreign passport holders had an easy escape route to other countries that Hong Kongers did not . 
Another part of the problem is that , while Hong Kong has long advised people to wear face masks in public , other governments have given conflicting advice , and those returning to or going about the city unmaksed may be following the guidance of their home countries .
