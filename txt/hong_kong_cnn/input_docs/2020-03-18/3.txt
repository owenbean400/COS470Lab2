Hong Kong reported its largest increase in new coronavirus cases on Wednesday , after a period of apparent slowdown in infections . 
For most of March , few , if any , cases were reported every day . 
Today , there were 14 new cases -- all of which except one had recent international travel history . 
This brings the city 's total to 182 cases . 
Wong Ka hing , of Hong Kong â€™s Center for Health Protection , warned today that a huge volume of travelers is expected to arrive in Hong Kong in the coming days , especially as students abroad arrive home after university closures . 
This has raised alarm that there may be a second wave of infections , with travelers abroad potentially bringing back many new infections and forming new clusters . 
Starting Thursday , all international arrivals will be required to self quarantine for 14 days .
