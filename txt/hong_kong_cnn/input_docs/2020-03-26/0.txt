With a new wave of coronavirus cases spreading through Hong Kong , the city 's government and many businesses have announced new measures to rein in the outbreak . 
On Tuesday , Mc Donald 's Hong Kong announced it would be closing its 235 branches in the city -- usually open 24 hours -- from 6 p.m . every day . 
That 's devastating news for the hundreds of people experiencing homelessness who regularly spend their nights in the restaurants . 
A study in 2018 found there had been a five fold increase in the number of people sleeping in Mc Donald 's outlets , a number that has likely gone up as the city has felt the pinch from the coronavirus slowdown . 
Homeless charities had already reported record numbers of people seeking relief in recent weeks . 
Government homeless shelters are only opened during extreme weather , and do not provide a long term solution for many people sleeping rough . 
Help on the horizon : A fundraising push by Impact HK to raise money to house " Mc Refugees " has already passed its 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ( $ 12,900 ) goal . 
Crowdfunding continues : Rotmeyer said 100 % of funds would be used to support the homeless and would go to small hotels suffering from the economic slowdown .
