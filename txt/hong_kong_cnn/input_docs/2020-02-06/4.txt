Hong Kong 's Hospital Authority ( HA ) warned today that public hospitals would only offer limited services , as thousands of employees and medical workers began a fourth consecutive day of strike action . 
More than 7,000 healthcare workers participated in yesterday 's strike , according to the Hospital Authority Employee Alliance , a union representing medical workers . 
This accounts for nearly 10 % of all HA medical staff , the union said . 
Limited service : The HA urged patients with only mild conditions to visit private hospitals and doctors , or specialist clinics , given the depleted workforce in public hospitals today . 
Why they 're striking : Strikers and union members are demanding completely closed borders with mainland China , and have accused the city 's government of inadequate action during the coronavirus outbreak . 
Other demands include providing enough gear for health workers and providing " proper " isolation wards . 
Government response : Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam criticized the strikers for weakening the city 's medical capacity at a crucial time . 
Remaining employees still working in hospitals now have a heavier workload to make up for their absent colleagues , she said . 
Lam also announced new emergency measures yesterday , including a mandatory 14 day quarantine for all travelers coming from mainland China -- including Hong Kong residents .
