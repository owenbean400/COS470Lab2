Disney has warned that profits from its parks in China could drop by $ 280 million in the current quarter , due to shutdowns caused by the coronavirus and a loss of business related to recent mass protests in Hong Kong . 
The company added during its earnings call Tuesday that the coronavirus will hurt its results for the quarter through March and the fiscal year as a whole . 
Closed businesses : Disney suspended operations at some of its facilities in China last month as the outbreak spread . 
For now , the properties in Hong Kong and Shanghai are closed indefinitely , and " the precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures , " chief financial officer Christine Mc Carthy said . 
Operating income at the company 's Shanghai park could drop by about $ 135 million this quarter if the park remains closed for two months , she added .
