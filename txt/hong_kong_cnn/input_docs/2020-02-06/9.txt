Taiwan will prohibit international cruise ships from docking in its ports from today onward , according to a statement form the self governing island 's Ministry of Health . 
This comes as two cruise ships remain docked and quarantined in Japan and Hong Kong , with thousands on board , after the virus was spread by infected former passengers . 
The ship that is now in Hong Kong had docked and departed from Kaohsiung , Taiwan , on February 4 . 
It is unclear how long the ban will be in place .
