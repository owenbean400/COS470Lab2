New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy said the state is " literally at the edge " in regards to the number of ventilators available to treat coronavirus patients . 
There are 61 ventilators available in the state warehouses , New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said . 
Persichilli said there is a concern about the number of ventilators , and that they are looking for another option . 
Murphy said officials were on the phone with the White House Saturday morning and expressed that ventilators are a priority . 
Some context : The latest model projections report the hospitalizations in New Jersey will peak at 15,922 and ICU admissions will be about 3,821 –– but that changes daily , Persichilli said . 
She believes the state will have bed spaces for everyone , but the concern continues to be the availability of personal protection equipment and ventilators . 
Persichilli also said the USNS Comfort , a military hospital ship in New York City , will now be accepting patients from New Jersey hospitals .
