As the US has struggled with Covid 19 testing delays and supply chain shortages , White House testing czar Adm . Brett Giroir said Friday the administration has done " everything we can do to increase testing the capacity of the country . " 
When asked by CNN if it ’s true that the administration has exhausted its executive authority to acquire additional supplies for labs that are processing Covid 19 tests , Giroir said , " I ’m going to say definitively , yes . " 
On Thursday , Giroir said US testing is sufficient and the country ’s goal should not necessarily be to screen as much of the population as possible . 
His claim , according to Dr . Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , is not supported by experts . 
" I do not know why Admiral Giroir thinks that we are doing plenty of testing , when literally no public health expert I know of in the entire country agrees with his assessment , " Jha told CNN earlier Friday .
