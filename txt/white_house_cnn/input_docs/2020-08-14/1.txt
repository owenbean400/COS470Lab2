Adm . Brett Giroir , White House coronavirus testing czar , said the United States wants to increase Covid 19 testing , but " there is no physical way to do 5 million tests per day in this country . " 
Giroir was responding to comments by Dr . Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , who told CNN ’s Kate Bolduan Friday that the United States needs to be at least 4 to 5 million each day , based on current outbreak levels – and it ’s testing well below that number . 
Jha ’s remarks followed Giroir ’s comments a day earlier that the United States testing is sufficient and country ’s goal should not necessarily be to screen as many people as feasible . 
" I do not know why Admiral Giroir thinks that we are doing plenty of testing , when literally no public health expert I know of in the entire country agrees with his assessment , " Jha said earlier Friday . 
On Friday afternoon , Giroir told CNN ’s Pamela Brown , " I really felt compelled to come on this afternoon after hearing Dr . Jha this morning because just about everything he said was the opposite of what reality is , and that really troubled me , and I want to make sure that the American people understand where we are and where we 're going . " 
" When Dr . Jha comes on TV and attacks whether I care about this country and my patriotism , I figure if you have to stoop that low , the rest of the things must be doing OK . "
