The White House has formally declared that teachers are essential workers as part of its effort to encourage schools around the country to reopen for in person learning . 
The move is just the latest in the administration ’s campaign to pressure districts into bringing back students this fall . 
The essential worker designation provides guidance for educators that is only voluntary ; it calls on teachers to return to the classroom even after potential exposure . 
Some context : Vice President Mike Pence announced the decision to governors on a call earlier this week , a person familiar with the decision said . 
Under Department of Homeland Security guidance issued this week , teachers are now considered " critical infrastructure workers , " and are subject to the same kinds of advisories as other workers who have born that label – such as doctors and law enforcement officers . 
The guidance for essential workers states that they can continue to work even after exposure to a confirmed case of Covid 19 , provided they remain asymptomatic . 
Schools ’ contribution to community spread has already been a top concern for districts making the decision to open or close , so pushing teachers to continue working after potential exposure could prove controversial . 
White House officials made the move in part to convey how seriously its believes the schools question should be taken , the person said , but also to try to stabilize the teaching workforce and streamline guidance at a time of confusion about the future of classrooms .
