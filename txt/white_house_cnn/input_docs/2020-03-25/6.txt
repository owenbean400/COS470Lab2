White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow predicted , as expected , significant increases in unemployment numbers ahead of Thursday ’s jobs report . 
" That ’ll come out at 8:30 a.m . tomorrow but it ’s going to be a very big increase . 
Everybody in the market knows that , " he said during an appearance on Fox News . 
He said the House will pass the stimulus bill : " Yes the House will . 
They ’re on board . " 
Kudlow went on to explain how the package will add up to " $ 6 trillion " through the Federal Reserve . 
" Well this whole package is $ 2 trillion in direct assistance and on top of that , we are giving the Federal Reserve the resources to put up as much as $ 4 trillion to stabilize financial markets and back up loan guarantees and help some distressed industries . 
This is all on a short term basis , cause this is going to be weeks and months , not years . 
So when you add the two together , you ’re looking at $ 6 trillion package , " he said .
