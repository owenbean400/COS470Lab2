Dr . Deborah Birx came to the White House podium Wednesday with a personal story meant to express a dire warning to Americans shirking social distancing guidelines . 
Birx said that her grandmother lived with the guilt of infecting her mother during the pandemic of 1918 . 
Birx continued : " This is why we keep saying to every American : You have a role to protect each and every person that you interact with and we have a role to protect one another . 
It ’s why we are social distancing , why you are social distancing , but to every American out there : when you are protecting yourself , you are protecting others . 
And if you , inadvertently , I know , brought this virus home to someone with a preexisting condition , I can tell you my grandmother lived with that for 88 years … This is not a theoretic , this is a reality , you can see the number of deaths that are occurring . " 
Birx is the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force .
