Rhode Island Gov . 
Gina Raimondo said small businesses in her state need funding " right now " as the state is still weeks away from reaching a peak in coronavirus cases . 
Raimondo said coronavirus cases in the state are still increasing each day , and she will not be able to relax restrictions on businesses until " we 're on the backside of that curve . " 
Like businesses , hospitals also need emergency relief funding from the federal government , Raimondo added . 
" The White House and governors asked our hospitals to stop doing elective surgery for safety reasons . 
That 's their main source of revenue . 
We have to be there for the hospitals to help them , " she said . 
Raimondo said that while she agrees the next federal stimulus bill should include money or hospitals and state governments – not just strictly businesses – this is not a time for politics . 
" It is not time to play politics , " she said . 
" It 's time to deliver outcomes for the American people . 
That 's what they 're expecting from their leaders right now . "
