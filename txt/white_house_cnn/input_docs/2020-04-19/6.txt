New York state will undertake the " most aggressive " statewide antibody testing survey in the nation over the next week , according to Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo . 
Cuomo said they will sample thousands of people across the state to find out if they have antibodies . 
" That will tell us for the first time what percent of the population actually has had the coronavirus and is now at least short term immune to the virus , " he said . 
The New York State Department of Health will be running the tests over the next week . 
The state will have to work with the White House to assist with the supply chain and coordinate private labs , Cuomo said .
