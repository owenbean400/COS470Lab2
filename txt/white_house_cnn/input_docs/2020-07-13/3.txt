White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested Monday that there may be a financial incentive for local governments that reopen their schools . 
Kudlow reiterated that President Trump is considering defunding schools that do not reopen , but , " I think the President would be willing to consider additional funding for state and local governments if the schools do reopen , so that is perhaps an incentive . " 
The Fox hosts asked him about his comments that going back to school should not be " that hard . " 
He would not provide specifics on how much money would be allocated for areas that reopen schools . 
" It 's something that probably would be on the table . 
He has not made a decision . 
This is a pre decisional thought , but it can be done , " he said . 
" I mean this is not ... so difficult . 
We should not be so pessimistic ... 
America is creative and innovative , " Kudlow added . 
He also acknowledged on Fox that the new case rate is " disturbing " but it " does not yet seem to be translating " into another economic downturn .
