White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany did not offer any defense or pushback on the narrative of tension between the White House and Dr . Anthony Fauci when asked about his relationship with the task force Monday , instead saying the nation ’s top infectious disease expert simply " represents one viewpoint in the administration . " 
" The Admiral [ Brett Giroir ] hit the nail on the head on this yesterday . 
He was making the point that Dr . Fauci represents one viewpoint in the administration and he looks at things from a public health standpoint , " Mc Enany said during an appearance on Fox News . 
She continued : Remember : These remarks come as Trump and Fauci have not spoken in over a month . 
On school reopening , Mc Enany claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not looking at data or science when she was critical of the administration ’s reopening plans and is " messing with our children . " 
She was asked how the administration ’s guidelines would differ from CDC guidelines – though it ’s unclear what Trump administration guidelines the host was referring to . 
Regardless , Mc Enany said , " We leave it to localities as to exactly what guidelines work . " 
She said CDC guidelines are " out there as a best case scenario , " but many of its measures are " not possible or not feasible . " 
" These are perfect world guidelines , " she said of the CDC ’s recommendations .
