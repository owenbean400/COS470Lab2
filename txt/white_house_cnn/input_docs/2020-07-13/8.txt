The Association of American Medical Colleges released a statement in support of Dr . Anthony Fauci , and condemned efforts to discredit him . 
The AAMC statement notes that the group was " extremely concerned " and " alarmed " by efforts to discredit Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
What this is about : The White House has been making a concerted effort to discredit Fauci . 
The President on Monday retweeted a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that " everyone is lying " about coronavirus , and a White House official told CNN in a statement on Saturday that " several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr . Fauci has been wrong on things . " 
But the AAMC statement argues otherwise — saying that the United States should be " applauding " Fauci for his service , instead of discrediting him . 
" This does not mean that scientific knowledge and recommendations will not change as our understanding of the virus grows . 
To the contrary , a successful response depends on Dr . Fauci , his colleagues , and scientists throughout America ’s system of medical research who are able to draw conclusions based on current observations and continuously adjust those conclusions based on continuing observations , " the statement added . 
The college group said science is " a dynamic and evolving process . " 
" Taking quotes from Dr . Fauci out of context to discredit his scientific knowledge and judgment will do tremendous harm to our nation ’s efforts to get the virus under control , restore our economy , and return us to a more normal way of life . 
America should be applauding Dr . Fauci for his service and following his advice , not undermining his credibility at this critical time , " the statement read .
