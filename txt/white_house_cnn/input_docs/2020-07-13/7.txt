Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said the younger people who are testing positive for Covid 19 in this surge of the outbreak are very important to stopping it . 
" We ’ve got to convince them that just because they get infected and the likelihood that they ’re not going to get seriously ill , does not mean that their infection is not a very important part of the propagation of the outbreak , " Fauci said on Monday . 
Speaking during a webinar with Stanford School of Medicine , he said that young people need to think of not only their personal responsibilities , but their societal responsibilities . 
" Although you may not get sick , almost certainly you ’re going to infect somebody else , who almost certainly infects somebody else and then you will get a vulnerable person who will be sick , who will go to the hospital , who might die , " said Fauci , who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force .
