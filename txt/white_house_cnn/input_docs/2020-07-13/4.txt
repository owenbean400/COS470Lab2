The Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) is working on a supplemental funding request for education that would essentially create a new pot of money for schools — but one that districts can only access if they commit to reopening , a source familiar with the plan tells CNN . 
The White House has been told it cannot withhold existing funding from schools to get them to open their classrooms . 
This is a new working strategy to get around the rules : Instead of threatening baseline funding , the White House will just try to offer additional money to provide an advantage to schools that reopen . 
The proposal , which is for now in the works as part of the White House proposal for the next stimulus bill , provides yet another example of aides scrambling to find a workable avenue for plans President Donald Trump has announced without warning or preparation . 
Some context : Education Secretary Betsy De Vos on CNN yesterday would not deny that the administration would look at withholding funds from schools in order to force their hands . 
And earlier this morning , White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested in an interview with Fox News that there may be a financial incentive for local governments that reopen their schools amid the President ’s push to reopen .
