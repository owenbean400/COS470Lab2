Florida 's staggering new single day US state record of coronavirus cases underscores how the aggressive opening strategy championed by President Donald Trump and allied governors is turning into one of the worst political and economic calls in modern history . 
The Sunshine State recorded more than 15,000 new infections on Sunday -- the highest number of new cases in a single day by any state -- as the pandemic raged across southern and western heartlands including Texas , Georgia and Arizona . 
The surge came two months after many states , disregarding government guidelines , opened up bars , gyms , hair salons and other businesses . 
Fresh controversy is boiling meanwhile over Trump 's aggressive push to get schools fully operational within weeks , after Education Secretary Betsy De Vos failed repeatedly to outline a plan to do so safely in a CNN interview Sunday . 
The White House also intensified a stunning whispering campaign against the nation 's top infectious disease specialist , Dr . Anthony Fauci , accusing him of making mistakes and of refusing to prioritize the President 's interests . 
Trump 's fixation on his electoral prospects and desire to ignite an economic comeback were behind his assurances that it was safe to ease stay at home orders without waiting for infection curves to properly flatten . 
The push was eagerly embraced by some GOP governors , including Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis , who is now facing heavy criticism as his state sees runaway infection rates .
