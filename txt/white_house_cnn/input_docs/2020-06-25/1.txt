White House Economic adviser Larry Kudlow , when asked about the increase in coronavirus cases across the country and its economic impact , said Thursday that " there will be some shutdowns in individual places or certain stores , " but that he believes the country as a whole will not shutdown again . 
He said that while the US has seen an increase in cases nationally of " just a little bit , " multiple states have seen a decrease in cases . 
However , data shows , coronavirus cases continue to surge in the U.S . as some states are reporting record numbers , including the country 's three most populous states . 
Kudlow was also pleased the new jobless claims were down for the 12th straight week , and said he still believes the economy will have a strong V shaped recovery . 
Conditions in the US labor market are undoubtedly improving , but as CNN 's business team noted this morning the road to recovery is long and littered with obstacles . 
Last week 's new jobless claims brought the total claims filed since the mid March to 47.3 million . 
Kudlow said he believes the unemployment rate could fall below 10 % by year end .
