White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said the statistic she watches closest is the test positivity rate because it is " the most sensitive indicator " of how the coronavirus situation is unfolding at any particular time and place . 
The test positivity rate is the percentage of people who get tested and turn out to be infected with the virus . 
She said every Monday each governor gets an approximately 10 page report with that information . 
" We think that 's the earliest indicator . 
That 's why we show that at county level , at metro level , in small cities and large metro areas , as well as the state level — so that every governor and every mayor and every health commissioner can really understand what we 're seeing in their state . 
And so that we can really provide recommendations to the states on how best to control this virus , " she said . 
Birx said the country had to change its testing strategy to improve the turnaround time for test results — especially the hardest hit states , which also have the longest turnaround times . 
" We have three states that are equivalent to what the worst conditions were , as far as number of tests required , with New York … . 
So now we need three times , really , the number of tests that we had before . 
And so we 're really working to increase pooling . 
We know that can dramatically increase our through put , " she said . 
" Really , we need the Northeast and the Midwest , that have those very low test positive rates , to move to pooling so that those tests can be moved to the South , the Southwest and the West , " she said .
