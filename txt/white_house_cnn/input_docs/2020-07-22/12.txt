Fairfax County Public Schools in Northern Virginia , one of the largest public schools systems in the nation , has announced it will begin the school year virtually on Sept . 8 . 
In a message addressed to county parents , caregivers and staff , Superintendent Scott Brabrand said they had determined that " full time online instruction is the only safe option at this time . " 
" We will reassess health conditions regularly to determine when students can begin in person instruction , if science and data suggest it is safe to do so , " Brabrand added . 
This is a change from the county 's first back to school plan : The original plan for Fairfax County Public Schools was to open with two days a week in the classroom and the rest will be virtual . 
Parents could have chosen the option to have their children engage in only virtual learning , Brabrand told CNN ’s Dana Bash . 
The White House has been pushing for schools nation wide to open for in person teaching . 
In an interview on Fox News last week , Education Secretary Betsy De Vos said of Fairfax County ’s original plan , " What kind of family can orient their schedules around that kind of a schedule ? 
And for kids , it ’s just the wrong thing . "
