The surge in coronavirus cases seen across the South and Southwest can be linked back to the traveling people did around Memorial Day , White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said Wednesday . 
Birx told Fox News ’ Bret Baier Wednesday that the current spread of the pandemic — across the South , Southeast and into the Southwest and West — is very different than what the country experienced in March and April . 
" What do I mean by that ? 
This epidemic all appeared across the South and the West after June 10 simultaneously . 
Previously in the March April timeframe , first we had the New York Metro following Washington state , and then a series of metros that went down in a period of time , often two or three weeks apart , " she said .
