After passing their $ 3.4 trillion stimulus package in May , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats now say they are prepared to move forward with a scaled down $ 2.2 trillion package . 
But that price tag is still too high for Senate Republicans and the White House . 
If Pelosi puts the new package on the House floor , it â€™s a sign that her talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have collapsed . 
Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill tweeted that the speaker and Mnuchin spoke tonight and agreed to speak again tomorrow morning .
