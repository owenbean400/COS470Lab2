Even though children only account for about 10 % of coronavirus diagnoses , and under 1 % of the deaths , people should pay attention to the spread of the virus in kids , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday . 
" It is unclear the degree to which they transmit . 
There are papers that come out that say they do not do it as efficiently as adults do , particularly young children , " added Fauci , who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force . 
" But it â€™s an evolving situation . 
The more you read about it and the more papers come out , you have got to keep an open mind when it comes to an issue like what the role of children is in transmission , " Fauci added .
