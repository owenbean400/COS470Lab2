US officials are looking into a number of options to increase hospital capacity and ease the strain on protective gear like gowns and masks , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer Friday . 
Hospitals may consider " creating Covid wards , " similar to what has happened abroad . 
They are checking the availability of Veterans Affairs hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers . 
In addition to utilizing industrial N95 masks , Birx expressed interest in developing an option for people to " self test " for the virus . 
If that becomes a reality , " then we could really eliminate the amount of personal protective devices needed in the testing arena , " she said .
