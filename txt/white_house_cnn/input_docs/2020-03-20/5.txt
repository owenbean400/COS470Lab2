The United States may have tested roughly 170,000 people so far , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer Friday . 
" I know that in general our positivity rate is between 9 and 11 % , " Birx said . 
" If 90 % are negative , you can do the calculation of how many tests we have done . " 
There are currently more than 17,000 confirmed cases in the United States . 
On Thursday , Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that " tens of thousands of tests are being performed every day . " 
On Friday , President Trump said , " We have now a great system . 
And it 's almost fully in gear , but it 's able to test millions of people . " 
Currently , testing occurs through a variety of channels , including public health labs , hospitals and commercial labs . 
US health officials have said they are working on a system to share that data with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as required by law . 
Birx said she expects numbers to rise sharply over the coming days as labs run through a backlog of tests , as well .
