When asked if it was fair to say the White House has postponed all non coronavirus related events and travel , deputy press secretary Judd Deere told CNN that there has been a scaling back in activities as they continue to follow the President 's coronavirus guidelines . 
Deere added : " The complex has also implemented temperature checks at all entrances and for those in close contact with the President and Vice President , paused the internship and volunteer program , canceled all east and west wing tours and more to keep the campus safe and healthy . " 
But a White House official stressed to CNN that the situation is fluid and that they are constantly evaluating the situation . 
" This is a constantly changing , evolving situation , " the official said . 
For now , large scale social events — things that require logistical support and travel arrangements — are on hold . 
There are still events on the calendar in the month of April , for instance , but the schedule is being evaluated " day by day , " the official said . 
Earlier Friday , the White House announced that the Presidential Medal of Freedom event scheduled for Monday for Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player had been postponed .
