President Trump will soon discuss the coronavirus pandemic in an address from the Oval Office . 
A source briefed on the speech said senior White House adviser Stephen Miller is a " driving force " behind tonight 's speech . 
Trump is expected to urge common sense to Americans , asking the public to follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to wash hands and social distancing . 
This is notable as Trump does not follow all of the CDC recommendations himself , as in shaking hands .
