House Democrats , at the moment , plan to move a bill addressing the coronavirus under suspension of the rules when a final deal is reached , according to two people involved . 
That means they can skip the rules committee so long as the bill has two thirds support . 
The expectation is that the bill will pass easily if all parties sign off . 
While it 's not final yet , that â€™s the way this is going . 
They 're still working through some outstanding issues : The paid leave issue has been resolved by adding a tax credit to aid smaller employers , at the request of the White House . 
Final thoughts : They are on the verge of a deal . 
Not there yet .
