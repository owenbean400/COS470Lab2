Dr . Anthony Fauci made the argument to New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo Monday that coronavirus does not seem to be spreading in schools . 
It ’s one of the issues where governors and local leaders have strongly differed with federal leaders . 
Local leaders in many areas , including New York City , have opted to close schools to in person classes while Fauci , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House have all pushed hard to reopen schools . 
Fauci , who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told Cuomo that high percentages of schoolchildren are not testing positive for coronavirus . 
" You know , it originally did surprise me , " Fauci said , because there was always a concern looking at what ’s known to happen with influenza , that kids would be in school , get infected and come home and infect their parents and relatives . 
This is why it ’s better to close bars and keep the schools open , Fauci said . 
" So long as you subsidize and help the restaurateurs and the bar owners so that they do not go down and essentially crash because of the economic strain . 
But if we can keep those things under control , subsidize those people , as well as keep the schools open , we 'd be in good shape , " Fauci said .
