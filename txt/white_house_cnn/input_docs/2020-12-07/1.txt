Drug makers Pfizer and Moderna will not attend a White House summit on Covid 19 vaccines and their distribution Tuesday , despite being two of the companies behind developing those vaccines . 
The White House said that â€™s because the administration felt it was more important for regulators to attend and explain the authorization process to the American people . 
During a background call with reporters Monday , a senior administration official said that while both companies were involved with " initial discussions " of the planning of the summit , " there was a change of direction in light of the fact we would have the regulator participating in the event . " 
Dr . Peter Marks , the FDA official in charge of which Covid vaccines get authorized , will attend to , " explain to the audience how the FDA goes about reviewing vaccines , and how thorough they are just why the FDA review process is the gold standard for the world . " 
" We thought it was quite important to come for his session he 's going to leave shortly after that to get back to work , " another official said later . 
The White House claimed that " several vaccine manufacturers " had contacted organizers , some unsolicited , and had early discussions about participating . 
" We thought Peter Marks , if we 're trying to instill greater confidence , would be an independent voice for quality and effectiveness . 
And that would be more effective than the companies who are producing the vaccines themselves , " an official said , adding that , " from a regulatory perspective we cannot have the person in the room who is going to adjudicate emergencies use authorization with those who have submitted it during that evaluation period . " 
Also absent from the list of participants is Dr . Anthony Fauci . 
A senior administration official said Fauci was invited and wanted to participate , but was not able to because of an " important scheduling issue . "
