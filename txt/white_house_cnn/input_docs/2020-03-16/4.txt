President Trump on Monday suggested there may have been a mix up in communications at the White House over his recent coronavirus test . 
Trump said he took the test " late Friday night , " but did not specify whether he took it before or after White House doctors issued a memo saying the President did not need to take a test . 
" So very late on Friday night I did the test and he may have put out , or the doctor may have put out something â€¦ I do not know what time the letter went out , maybe it was put up by somebody else . 
But the results came back , I believe , the following day and we tested negative , " Trump said . 
CNN previously reported that the White House medical doctor released a memo Friday at midnight saying that Trump remains without symptoms for coronavirus and quarantine is not necessary . 
During a news conference earlier Friday , Trump had said he would likely get tested for coronavirus .
