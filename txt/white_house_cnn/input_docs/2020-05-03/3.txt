Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said on Fox this morning that having a coronavirus vaccine by January is possible " on paper " but will require the proper execution . 
Birx was asked whether it was realistic to have a vaccine by the start of next year , given other estimates that it will take at least 12 to 18 months to develop . 
" The way that it ’s possible is if you bring forward five or six different classes of candidates , which the Operation Warp Speed has done , " Birx said . 
" And so it ’s not relying on a single vaccine platform . 
It ’s relying on several different candidates that are made differently and act differently . " 
The vaccine would also require speeding up clinical trials , she said . 
CNN previously reported that the goal is to make 100 million doses of a vaccine available by November , 200 million doses by December and 300 million doses by January , according to a senior administration official . 
On remdesivir : Birx described the investigational drug remdesivir as a " first step forward . " 
In early results from a trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health , the drug was found to shorten the duration of illness in severely affected patients , but it had no statistically significant effect on mortality . 
Birx said we ’ve only seen " half the data , " but she said an independent monitoring board thought the improvement was significant enough to start giving remdesivir to patients who were previously receiving a placebo . 
" So it ’s a first step forward . 
In parallel , we have a whole series of therapeutics including plasma , and also monoclonal antibodies being worked through , " she said , referring to lab made antibodies targeting the virus .
