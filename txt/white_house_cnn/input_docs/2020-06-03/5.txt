On the heels of several studies showing hydroxychloroquine does not help patients in the hospital with Covid 19 , a new study – the first of its kind – shows the drug does not work to prevent infection with the virus , either . 
The study of 821 people is a randomized , double blind , placebo controlled clinical trial , considered the gold standard in medicine . 
The study was expected to be published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . 
The researchers assigned about half the study subjects to take hydroxychloroquine and half to take a placebo , or a pill that does nothing . 
Neither the researchers nor the study subjects knew who was taking hydroxychloroquine and who was taking a placebo . 
They found the drug did not make a difference – over the next two weeks , the study subjects came down with Covid symptoms in equal amounts . 
The study ’s senior author , Dr . David Boulware , says that on May 9 , the White House physician sent him an email asking his opinion of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against Covid 19 . 
Boulware , an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota , says he advised Trump ’s physician that there was no published research showing hydroxychloroquine worked preventatively and shared that people in his study who took hydroxychloroquine had higher rates of side effects , mostly gastrointestinal problems such as nausea and vomiting . 
On May 18 , Trump announced that he ’d been taking the medicine for a week and a half .
