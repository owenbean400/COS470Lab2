After the Trump administration ’s coronavirus travel restrictions came into effect this week , local and state officials say they were left scrambling to figure out the new rules . 
An East Coast official told CNN that planes were arriving " within hours " with no federal protocols in place -- the quarantine locations were still to be determined , and authorities were " scrambling to see who had hospital beds available . " 
The official told CNN they were left to devise solutions to how to execute the federal order on their own . 
" These planes were going to land , and we were basically thinking , what the hell are we going to do ? " 
Similar complaints came from a state official on the West Coast . 
This official says he worked throughout the weekend to coordinate efforts , and was on the phone with the White House several times . 
" It ’s been very , very challenging to keep up with everything , " he said . 
" There are a lot of unknowns . "
