As of Friday at 6 p.m . ET , roughly 5,861 tests for coronavirus have been completed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and public health labs , US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said at off camera briefing at the White House on Saturday . 
Trump administration health officials had not released specific figures until today . 
This does not mean that 5,861 people have been tested . 
Currently each person tested typically has two swabs taken â€“ one from the nose and one from the throat . 
The 5,861 number also does not include tests performed at private or commercial labs . 
Right now Hahn said there is an ability to perform 75,000 tests . 
Officials , however , expect that number to jump dramatically next week with the additional production by private manufacturers of coronavirus testing kits .
