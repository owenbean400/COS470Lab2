Former New Jersey Gov . 
Chris Christie had " an awakening " after spending a week in an intensive care unit with Covid 19 , Dr . Jonathan Reiner , a professor of medicine at George Washington University , said Thursday . 
" Sounds like Gov . 
Christie had an awakening , " Reiner , a CNN analyst and cardiologist to former Vice President Dick Cheney , told CNN â€™s Don Lemon after Christie issued a statement on his illness . 
Christie sounded humble and angry at the same time , he said . 
" When he started talking about how , you know , he believed he 'd be safe at the White House , but he was not , he should have worn a mask when he went to the SCOTUS announcement , he should have worn a mask at the debate prep . 
He sounded like he had been betrayed , " Reiner said . 
Christie attended Amy Coney Barrett 's announcement ceremony at the White House Rose Garden and helped President Donald Trump prepare for his first debate against Joe Biden just over two weeks ago . Christie said he was wrong not to wear a mask .
