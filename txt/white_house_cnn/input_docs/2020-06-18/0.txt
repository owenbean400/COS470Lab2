The top government health experts in the United States have been mostly missing from public discussions and updates on the coronavirus pandemic for weeks now . 
Former White House medical team adviser under George W . Bush , Dr . Jonathan Reiner , said it ’s because " they tell the truth . " 
White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx , Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr . Robert Redfield , and top infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci have given few updates on the US ’ Covid 19 response and given few interviews on the state of the pandemic . 
Reiner said that the experts ’ opinions on the state of the pandemic go against messaging by the Trump administration . 
" The vice president in his op ed yesterday spoke about that he 'd not only marshaled the whole government , but a whole of America response to this , but he really has not , " Reiner said . 
" If he was doing that , if the administration was doing that , they would ask the American people to do something very difficult , which is to protect each other . 
And the way we protect each other is through social distancing and wearing masks and it 's hard to do , and , and it 's decidedly abnormal , but that ’s how we put this pandemic down . "
