As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the US , the nation 's top infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci says that anti science bias in the country is causing problems . 
" So when they see someone up in the White House , which has an air of authority to it , who 's talking about science , that there are some people who just do not believe that -- and that 's unfortunate because , you know , science is truth , " said Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Fauci , who has served six US administrations so far , was seemingly referring to his appearances in White House press conferences during the coronavirus pandemic . 
" It 's amazing sometimes the denial there is , it 's the same thing that gets people who are anti vaxxers , who do not want people to get vaccinated , even though the data clearly indicate the safety of vaccines , " Fauci added . 
" That 's really a problem . "
