Dr . Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation , told CNN Monday night that he was " pretty surprised " by his model ’s downward revision . 
His comments come after his model -- which is a key coronavirus forecast often cited by the White House -- revised its death projection for the United States slightly downward . 
It 's now predicting that 143,360 people will die by August 4 -- about 3,700 fewer deaths than the model predicted when last updated on May 12 . 
" I must say , we were pretty surprised , Anderson . 
We were expecting them to probably go up because of a big surge in mobility in the last two , three weeks that we ’ve seen in the cell phone data , " Murray said on " Anderson Cooper 360 " when asked about the new forecast . 
Murray had previously explained upticks in the model ’s projections by pointing to mobility data . 
The thinking had been that as people move around more , they ’ll come into contact with more people and create opportunities for transmission . 
But those expected increases in infections have not materialized yet -- at least not to the extent IHME expected . 
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta pointed to delays between infections , hospitalizations and deaths , and asked Murray what he thought the model would look like in a few weeks , as the impact of reopenings becomes clearer . 
" I think we ’re going to really need to watch the next week or two , because we sort of expected to see it by now , but certainly it could just be a lagged effect , " Murray said . 
" And I think we may also run into the phenomenon that people may get fatigued of being cautious -- stop wearing a mask , start having more physical contact . "
