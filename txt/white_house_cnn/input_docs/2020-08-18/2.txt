Saliva tests are really important and the way they work makes them more amenable to surveillance testing , said Adm . Brett Giroir , the White House coronavirus testing coordinator , on Good Morning American on Tuesday . 
" I think it â€™s very important , " he said . 
Giroir noted some saliva tests , like Saliva Direct , which recently received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration , and another in the works , do not need swabs , do not need special transport media and do not need some of the chemical reagents used in other tests . 
Giroir said that more saliva tests will be available soon .
