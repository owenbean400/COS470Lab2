Adm . Brett Giroir , the White House coronavirus testing coordinator , said on Tuesday that he is not dismissive of testing , but that it has to be part of a comprehensive plan that focuses on other coronavirus prevention measures . 
" The only thing I ’ve been trying to say is that it ’s part of a comprehensive plan , " he said . 
People have to wear a mask , watch their distance and wash their hands , " Giroir said , " That ’s the core . " 
Still , he said , there are continued investments being made in testing , and point of care testing will be particularly important to supporting the reopening of schools and businesses .
