Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell to " join the rest of the Senate " in bipartisan stimulus negotiations , while describing last night 's proposal from the White House as " an encouraging sign that the Republican leadership is moving in the right direction by endorsing the size of the gang of eight ’s bill . " 
Schumer praised the price tag proposed by the White House but criticized certain aspects of the proposal , including " an unacceptably low amount " of unemployment benefits in exchange for the $ 600 direct payments included . 
In encouraging Mc Connell to sit down and negotiate , Schumer said , " That ’s where the real action is and where bipartisan agreement on the basic concepts will ultimately be forged . " 
Schumer further praised Biden 's picks , including Gen . Lloyd Austin for secretary of Defense and Xavier Becerra for Health and Human Services secretary , and chastised his Republican colleagues for holding Biden 's nominees to different standards than Trump 's .
