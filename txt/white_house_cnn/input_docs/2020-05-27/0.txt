A coronavirus model that has been cited by the White House now projects that fewer people will die in the United States by August . 
In a Tuesday update , the model revised its forecast to 132,000 deaths — which is 11,000 fewer than it projected a week ago . Built by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , the model is one of more than a dozen highlighted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website . 
An ensemble forecast from the CDC , which relies on multiple models , projects that US deaths will exceed 110,000 by June 13 . 
The White House cited the IHME model often in April , but it has been criticized by some for its assumptions and performance . 
The model has undergone a number of revisions in the past few weeks . 
As states began reopening , IHME upped its forecast for the number of US deaths , based in part on cell phone mobility data that showed people moving around more . 
But the institute began revising its projections downwards last week , saying an expected increase in infections had not yet occurred . 
Dr . Christopher Murray , the IHME director , said that might have been because of behavioral changes such as mask wearing . 
The institute has since described its plan for gathering data on how many Americans wear masks . 
It ’s not clear what drove down the model ’s projections on Tuesday , however .
