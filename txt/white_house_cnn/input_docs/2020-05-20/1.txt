Brazil â€™s Lower House of Congress approved a proposed law Tuesday , which would make masks mandatory in public spaces amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
Any businesses authorized to operate during the pandemic must provide masks to employees who work with the public , and the government must also provide masks to low income citizens , the proposed law stated . 
The proposal needs to be approved by the Senate and by President Jair Bolsonaro in order to be signed into law . 
Brazil on Tuesday recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus deaths and cases , with 1,179 deaths and 17,408 new infections . 
This comes a day after it became the country with the third highest number of cases in the world . 
US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday he may consider imposing a travel ban to Brazil . 
Meanwhile , President Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the health crisis , saying the economic impacts will be far worse to what he 's compared to a " little flu . " 
Bolsonaro in a tweet today said there will be new guidelines to expand the use of chloroquine for treating coronavirus , although it is an unproven treatment for the virus . 
Brazil 's medical authority approved the use of hydroxychloroquine in April in serious cases of coronavirus if doctor and patient agree . 
The Brazilian president has pushed for approval to use the drug in less serious cases .
