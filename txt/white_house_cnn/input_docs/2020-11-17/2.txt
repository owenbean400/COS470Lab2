Republican Sen . 
Kevin Cramer defended North Dakota Gov . 
Doug Burgum and said he does not have any regrets about his home state not acting sooner to institute mask mandates , adding that " North Dakotans are free people who love freedom . " 
North Dakota remains the state with the most cases per 100,000 population , followed by South Dakota , according to recent state reports from the White House coronavirus task force . 
On Friday , Burgum announced a new measure requiring face coverings in indoor businesses and indoor public settings as well as outdoor public settings where physical distancing is not possible . 
Asked Tuesday if he has regrets this was not done earlier , Cramer said , " No , no . " 
He stressed that his concern lies mostly with the economy and the effect that new restrictions might have on North Dakotans ' livelihoods . 
" I am hearing from dozens and dozens of restaurant owners , motel , hotel owners that are very concerned about their survival . 
So , that 's as big , if not a bigger concern for me , is the loss of jobs , the loss of businesses and small businesses and loss of an economy that 's going to be hard to rebuild if we do not reopen it in an appropriate manner , " Cramer said .
