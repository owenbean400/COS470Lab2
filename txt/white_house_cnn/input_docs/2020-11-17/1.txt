The White House coronavirus task force has again ramped up its warnings to states in a weekly report as the pandemic continues to aggressively worsen , raising alarms on the potential impact of rising cases on hospitals . 
The language in the weekly reports , which offer the administration ’s most unvarnished picture of the pandemic , has become progressively more dire in recent weeks , matching the severity of the current situation as the President himself remains silent on rising cases , focusing instead on positive vaccine developments in his only public event on the matter in a month last Friday . 
North Dakota remains the state with the most cases per 100,000 population , followed by South Dakota , then Iowa , Wyoming , Wisconsin , Nebraska , Illinois , Minnesota , Kansas , and Montana . 
Hawaii is the state with the fewest cases per 100,000 population . 
This week ’s reports also included a comparison to Europe , which is experiencing , per the task force , " a fall surge similar to the USA . " 
Europe , however , is " showing early signs of improvement , " the reports said , citing mask requirements in public settings , with most European countries imposing fines for non compliance , as well as " significant restrictions on gathering size . "
