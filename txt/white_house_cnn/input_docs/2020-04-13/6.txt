An influential coronavirus model cited by the White House said that today is the peak day for daily deaths in the United States . 
About 2,150 Covid 19 deaths are projected for today and deaths are expected to decline moving forward , according to model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington . 
A total of 68,841 people are now expected to die in the US by August , which is up from Friday ’s projection of 61,500 deaths . 
The model predicts the pandemic will peter out in May , but experts have questioned its assumption that there will be no resurgence of the virus in the summer months According to the model , the US hit " peak resource use " three days ago , on Friday . 
The latest update of the model says the US faced a shortage of 7,369 intensive care beds on that date , but it ’s unclear whether that occurred . 
Hard hit New York hit its peak number of deaths three days ago , according to the model , but hundreds of deaths are still expected daily for the coming weeks . 
Some states are still expected to be weeks away from their peak numbers of deaths : Florida , for example , is expected to hit peak deaths on May 6 , when 128 people are projected to die . 
Texas , for its part , is predicted to hit peak deaths on April 30 , when 71 people are estimated to die . 
The country ’s largest state , California , is projected to hit peak deaths in six days , on April 19 , when about 50 people are estimated to die .
