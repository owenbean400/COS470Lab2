President Trump has no intention of firing Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Monday . 
The statement comes after Trump fueled speculation about Fauci 's future on Sunday , retweeting a conservative who called for the expert to be fired after he said in a CNN interview more could have been done to prevent the spread of coronavirus . 
Trump has disputed that his administration was slow to respond , despite increased scrutiny of his initial handling of the crisis as it 's been revealed that administration and health officials were sounding alarms for weeks before the President took decisive actions such as calling for social distancing measures .
