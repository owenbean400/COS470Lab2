President Trump has not made a final decision on the restoration of funding to the World Health Organization , according to a tweet he sent Saturday morning . 
This came in response to a report from Fox News that the administration was going to restore some funding to the WHO . 
Fox obtained a five page draft letter to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Friday that says the administration will " agree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions " to the WHO . 
A senior administration official told Fox that the President had agreed to the plan in the letter . 
Trump said the plan detailed in the report " is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10 % of what we have been paying over many years , matching much lower China payments , " adding that all funds to the WHO are still frozen . 
Some context : Trump said Thursday that the White House will likely be making an announcement related to the WHO next week , after his administration sought to cast blame on the organization for not acting quick enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus . 
In April , Trump announced he was halting funding to the WHO while a review would be conducted .
