US President Donald Trump hoped this would be the week he emerged into a nation recovering from pandemic . 
Instead the pandemic came to him . 
A day after breaking his White House self isolation for a cross country trip meant to signal the country 's readiness to restart , Trump received word that one of his Oval Office valets tested positive for the virus . 
Two days later , Vice President Mike Pence 's press secretary also tested positive -- setting off another round of tests , delaying the vice president 's trip to Iowa and causing more hand wringing inside the White House about who might be infected . 
Why this is important : The arrival of coronavirus to the West Wing only served to illustrate the continued spread of the disease months into a pandemic that 's taken more than 77,000 American lives and turned a once hot economy to ice . 
Even the nightly deep cleanings , regular testing and a lot of wishful thinking could not prevent the virus from arriving on Trump 's doorstep . 
As the President agitates for states to loosen their restrictions and allow Americans back into workplaces and businesses , the sight of his aides contracting the disease did little to boost confidence the nation is ready to return to normal , even as jobless claims skyrocket to never seen before levels and options for reviving the economy fall short . 
At the same time , it had no apparent effect on Trump 's willingness to proceed as normal on Friday , when he eschewed a mask while visiting with nonagenarian World War II veterans and invited a large group of lawmakers to the White House for a meeting , all of whom were tested before arriving . 
Asked the reason his staff were not wearing masks on Friday , Trump pointed to the one White House official in the room who was : the White House photographer . 
It 's all part of Trump 's business as usual approach that 's become his default as he looks to move past the outbreak .
