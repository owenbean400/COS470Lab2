Former White House national security adviser John Bolton said he does not have confidence in President Trump ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic . 
" I do not , " Bolton said when asked by CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer if he has confidence in Trump ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic . 
" It is not a comprehensive strategy , " he said , noting that the federal response has " not been consistent . " 
The Trump administration is trying to stop the release of Bolton 's book , which alleges that Trump asked China 's leader to help him win the 2020 election and expressed support for concentration camps for Muslims in China . 
Bolton argued in a court filing last week it 's too late to stop the release of his book , and says that the government ca not do so because it would violate his First Amendment rights .
