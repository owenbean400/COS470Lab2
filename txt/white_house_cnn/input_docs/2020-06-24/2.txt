US President Donald Trump either does not understand the two most effective tools for putting the pandemic down or he ’s trying to promote a false narrative , says Dr . Jonathan Reiner , a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University . 
Trump has refused to wear a mask in public and at meetings and events at the White House . 
He has also questioned the need for coronavirus testing . 
" What he does not understand is that ’s how we extinguish the virus , " Reiner said . 
" That ’s how you get people to quarantine . 
We contact trace their contacts , they stay home . 
That ’s how you drop the transmission of the virus . " 
" By the same token , he does not believe in face masks and we know now with certainty that ’s the principal way we prevent person to person transmission outside the home , " he added . 
Reiner questioned why the President does not seem to understand the simple formula that has driven Covid 19 cases down in other countries .
