Wearing a face mask in public to limit the spread of the deadly coronavirus should not be a political issue , according to the nation â€™s top infectious diseases expert , Dr . Anthony Fauci . 
Fauci was asked during an interview at the Sacramento Press Club Wednesday about the politicization of wearing face coverings , even as cases of Covid 19 continue increasing in more than 10 states . 
Some context : President Trump and members of his administration have shunned wearing masks in public , even at crowded campaign rallies and White House events , prompting supporters to eschew wearing them , as well . 
Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said an analysis of mask use shows very clearly that it makes a difference .
