New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy said with his " best understanding of the data " right now he suspects the state is " still a number of weeks away " in regards to reopening . 
The state " suffered an extraordinary toll , " adding that fatalities continue to be significant , though he reiterated the positive test curve has flattened , Murphy said on NBC today . 
There have been fatalities in each of the 21 counties , however the northeast part of the state , near New York City , " have been crushed . " 
During the interview on NBC , the governor was asked what kind of path he would be expected to take on reopening . 
Murphy was also asked about what services he may need to cut back on without funding from the government . 
" We ’ve had constructive conversations and exchanges and we ’re on with the White House morning , noon and night on healthcare , on testing , on financial matters . 
I have to reiterate what senator Mc Connell said about letting states go bankrupt was both irresponsible and not factual , " Murphy said . 
" We wo not go bankrupt but we ’ll gut the living daylights out of things like educators , first responders , the very folks we desperately need . " 
" This is the healthcare crisis of all time in our countries history , we need states to be fully funded at the point of attack being there for our residents and so we need a big slug , " he added .
