White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett painted a dire economic picture Sunday for the coming months because of the impact of coronavirus on businesses around the country . 
Hassett predicted a very negative report on the economic output of the country . 
Hassett separately said during an interview on ABC that he thought the country is going to see an unemployment rate comparable to the Great Depression . 
" This is the biggest negative shock that our economy , I think , has ever seen . 
We 're going to be looking at an unemployment rate that approaches rates that we saw during the Great Depression , " Hassett said . 
" During the Great Recession , remember that was a financial crisis around 2008 , that we lost 8.7 million jobs and the whole thing . 
Right now , we 're losing that many jobs about every ten days . " 
While some private economists have predicted unemployment at that level , what is important is that these predictions are coming from a key White House economic adviser . 
Some context : On Wednesday , the Commerce Department will release the nation ’s first quarter GDP which will show the initial economic downturn due to the coronavirus . 
Those figures will show the start of the economic slide , but the major impact will be seen in the numbers reflecting the second quarter GDP which will be released in July . 
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin , meanwhile , painted a more positive outlook on Sunday . 
He told reporters he believes the economy will begin to bounce back this summer because of the economic activity that he hopes will occur in May and June , as some states begin to reopen . 
" This is an unprecedented situation . 
This is not a financial crisis , this is — we shut down , " Mnuchin told reporters at the White House . 
" The traditional economic models may work . 
They may not work . "
