The US President elect and vice president elect pledge to ensure free , reliable testing for all Americans , a better supply of personal protective equipment , clear and consistent guidance and a $ 25 billion vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan .

The team plans to draw up a " nationwide Pandemic Dashboard that Americans can check in real time to help them gauge whether local transmission is actively occurring in their zip codes . " 
The team also intends to restore the Obama era White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense , which was disbanded in 2018 . 
The Trump Administration invested heavily in vaccine development and promised any approved coronavirus vaccine would be provided free of cost to all Americans . 
But the White House also struggled to deploy enough tests and PPE to those that needed it . 
The current administration has also publicly battled with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) about coronavirus guidance . 
The US is approaching 10 million diagnosed coronavirus cases ( the CDC says the majority of cases have gone undiagnosed ) and a quarter of a million deaths .
