House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters today she has " great confidence " in Dr . Anthony Fauci , head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases , but said its " not encouraging " that scientists need White House approval to speak about coronavirus . 
What this is about : The New York Times reported that Fauci recently told associates he has been instructed by the White House not to speak out about the virus without clearance , though sources tell CNN Fauci is still expected to appear on television . 
Pelosi said that a supplemental spending package will be released " as soon as we can " and said they are working to coordinate a " science based , evidence based " approach to the outbreak . 
She also talked about the importance of washing hands , even noting : " I used to tell President Bush Sr . wash your hands . 
He was traveling some place . 
' Wash your hands . ' ... 
Washing your hands is probably one of the best forms of prevention . " 
She also said she hoped to have some " more advisory " from the Capitol physician 's office about preventative measures that can be taken in Congress .
