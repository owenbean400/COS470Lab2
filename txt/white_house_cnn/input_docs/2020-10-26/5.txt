In response to the White House chief of staff Mark Meadows saying the US is " not going to control " the coronavirus pandemic , Independent Sen . 
Angus King said that â€™s " unconditional surrender . " 
He cited the US CDC guidelines on wearing masks , washing hands and social distancing for stopping the spread of the virus , and he blamed the White House for inconsistent messaging . 
" If that had been the consistent message from the White House from the beginning , when we knew those were [ the things ] we had to do , and in the meantime , had they developed a really strong testing program , there would probably be 50 to 100,000 fewer deaths . 
We would be looking like other countries that are having surges but nothing like what we 're having . 
And like I say , yesterday was the moment that the White House surrendered to the virus . " 
Cases are surging across the country and nearly 225,000 Americans have died from the virus .
