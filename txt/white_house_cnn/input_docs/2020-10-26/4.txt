White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday that stimulus talks have slowed but have not ended as the negotiators have failed to reach a deal with just eight days to the election . 
" We ’ll get a report this morning . 
Sec . 
Mnuchin will be talking to them . 
I think he ’s going to be talking to Speaker Pelosi , " he said . 
He said the sides are " close " but " important policy issues " still separate them . 
" They ’re still talking , but I acknowledge the clock is ticking . " 
Kudlow reiterated that there is a " strong , V shaped recovery , " and stimulus could help in certain targeted areas , going on to cast blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . 
He said the recovery is " self sustaining . " 
Kudlow was also pressed on comments from White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on CNN about not controlling the virus . 
He reiterated best practices and said , " We get these pop ups . 
I ’m not sure there ’s anything we can do about it . 
We ’re seeing it in Europe and all around the world , perhaps that ’s what chief Meadows was referring to , but we know a lot more than we knew . " 
Dr . Deborah Birx , he said , is on the road with CDC teams in a " number of hot spots , " where they are " emphasizing the need for these guidelines . " 
" That ’s the best we can do , and it has worked in the past and hopefully it will continue to work , " he said .
