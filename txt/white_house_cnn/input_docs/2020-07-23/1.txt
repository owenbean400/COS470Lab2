Administration officials were alerted tonight that a cafeteria employee on the White House grounds has tested positive for coronavirus , according to an email viewed by CNN . 
Ike ’s Eatery -- located in the Executive Office building -- and the cafeteria in the New Executive Office Building have both been temporarily closed , though the email cautioned that risk of transmission is low due to precautions like gloves and masks . 
Those facilities are separate from the West Wing mess , but dozens of West Wing staffers walk to Ike ’s for meals . 
The email says they conducted contact tracing and claim no executive office staff need to quarantine due to exposure .
