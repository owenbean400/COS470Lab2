Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a payroll tax cut will not be included in the forthcoming legislative package expected to be rolled out by Senate Republicans on Thursday . 
Mnuchin said the President 's " priority for the moment is to get money into Americans quickly and one of the problems with the payroll tax cut is it takes time . " 
Pressed by CNN on whether it will be included in this bill , Mnuchin said : " Not in this , but we 're going to come back again . 
There may be a CARES 5.0 . " Some background : President Trump had been pushing Congress to include a payroll tax cut in the next economic relief package . 
He unsuccessfully pressed for one earlier in the year , and renewed comments this week make it clear the policy remains a key White House priority . 
But a growing number of Republicans are not in favor of the idea and most Democrats do not support it . 
Payroll tax cuts have had mixed results in the past , and some economists argue that it 's not the best way to boost the economy right now . 
A payroll tax cut would reduce the amount taken out of workers ' paychecks to fund federal programs including Social Security and Medicare . 
Congress would have to decide how much to reduce the rate and how long the tax holiday would last . 
Currently , workers pay about 7.65 % of their wage and salary incomes . 
Employers match the amount while those who are self employed pay both shares , though they get to deduct the employer portion .
