US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he has not spoken to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about continuing negotiations for coronavirus relief legislation . 
" I ’ve spoken to several Democrats . 
I have not spoken to Schumer and Pelosi since then , " Mnuchin said during a White House press briefing with President Trump on Monday . 
Asked if he ’d reach out to the Democratic leaders to restart negotiations , Mnuchin said , " Any time they want to meet and they ’re willing to negotiate , have a new proposal , we ’re more than happy to meet . " 
Mnuchin also said he expects unemployment insurance payments to be ready to go out in most states within two weeks . 
" I think within the next week or two , most of the states will be able to execute , " Mnuchin said during a White House press conference Monday . 
Some background : With negotiations on a new deal stalled , President Trump on Saturday unveiled an executive action that would provide the unemployed $ 300 a week under a new " lost wages assistance " program , but only if states first agree to put up an additional $ 100 a week -- which the President cited as a total benefit of $ 400 a week .
