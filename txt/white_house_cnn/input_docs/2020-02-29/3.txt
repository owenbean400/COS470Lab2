US health officials told reporters Saturday that reinfection with the novel coronavirus is unlikely . 
" We have not seen any sign yet of the phenomenon " of reinfection , said Dr . Nancy Messonnier , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Messonnier suggested any reports suggesting otherwise may be indicative of doctors and scientists jumping the gun , skirting around proper scientific review . 
She said the CDC has been following US cases closely , including " whether or not they continue to harbor the virus in their nose and throat . " 
Thus far , reinfection is " not something that we 're seeing here , and it has not changed our clinical practice , " she said . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , made similar comments earlier Saturday at a White House briefing . 
" There 's no indication that that 's going on at all . 
If this virus acts like other viruses — which I have no reason to believe it wo not — once you 've gotten infected and recovered , you 're not going to get infected with the same virus , " Fauci said .
