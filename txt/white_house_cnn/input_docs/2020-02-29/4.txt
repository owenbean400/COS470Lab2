Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Friday called the coronavirus a " pandemic , " using a term that has not been used by the White House or government health agencies as the Trump administration struggles to stay on message in response to the virus ' outbreak . 
" Hopefully we can get past this coronavirus pandemic very quickly and get back to the trade , " Perdue said while speaking to farmers at the Commodity Classic conference in San Antonio , according to audio of his remarks obtained by CNN . 
The secretary 's use of the word is out of sync with the official message from the Trump administration , which has sought to downplay fears of a pandemic . 
Global health officials have not labeled the virus ' outbreak a pandemic , either . 
All public messaging on the coronavirus is supposed to be cleared by Vice President Mike Pence 's office , an attempt to get the Trump administration on the same page after administration officials blamed a series of mixed messages from senior officials earlier in the week for critical media coverage . 
Pence is leading the administration 's efforts to combat the coronavirus . 
The basis for Perdue 's use of the term is unclear . 
CNN has reached out to the Department of Agriculture for clarification but has not yet heard back . 
The White House is declining to comment .
