A " doctors ’ group " has banded together as an offshoot of the White House coronavirus task force , a source close to the task force told CNN . 
Members of the group include Dr . Deborah Birx , Dr . Anthony Fauci , Dr . Stephen Hahn and Dr . Robert Redfield . 
The source said the doctors ’ group meets two to three times a week by phone and then briefs Vice President Mike Pence . 
One of these briefings is scheduled for today , when the group plans to raise the issue of increased infection rates in many states . 
Remember : President Trump declared last month that his coronavirus task force would continue " indefinitely " after he and Pence said they were phasing out the health focused panel in favor of a group focused on reopening the economy . 
The reversal came after outcry and concern from outside health experts , who said it was too early to disband the health focused panel . 
Currently , there are 21 states with infection rates trending upward in newly reported cases from one week to the next .
