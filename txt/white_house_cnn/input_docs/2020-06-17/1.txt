A group of GOP senators all wore face masks to a news conference to where they unveiled their police reform plan . 
When each senator approached the lectern to speak , he or she removed his or her mask . 
The senators put their masks back on when they returned to the sides of the podium . 
This is in contrast to how the White House how handled events and news conferences in the pandemic : In the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon , President Trump announced an executive order on policing without a mask on . 
And by the look of a video the White House sent out on Twitter shortly afterward , almost no one in attendance wore a mask either .
