Top negotiators signaled on Tuesday that a bipartisan deal on a massive stimulus package to respond to the coronavirus crisis is imminent with all signs pointing to an agreement being locked in and approved by both chambers of Congress as early as later in the day . 
Leaders in Congress and the Trump administration have been working for days to pass as quickly as possible a roughly $ 2 trillion economic stimulus package , which would include direct payments to taxpayers among hundreds of billions of dollars in other stimulus measures . 
However objections from Democrats over accountability and process have prevented the legislation from advancing . 
But signs from leaders in both parties over the past several hours suggest that those differences are either addressed or very close to being settled â€” and that a final deal could move swiftly through Congress . 
In an indication that a deal is nearly at hand , Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell said this morning , " We are very close . 
We are close to a bill that takes our bold Republican framework , integrates further ideas from both parties and delivers huge progress . " 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi similarly signaled a deal would be finalized in the coming hours , saying today " there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours , " as last minute negotiations continue . 
Signs of a breakthrough come after days of drawn out and intense negotiations between congressional Republicans , Democrats and the Trump administration . 
In a move that could resolve another sticking point , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , who has been negotiating the deal , has agreed to an inspector general and congressional overnight for a $ 500 billion fund proposed for distressed companies , a senior White House official told CNN .
