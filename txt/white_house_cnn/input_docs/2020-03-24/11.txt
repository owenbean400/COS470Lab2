With the time slipping as senators and the White House continue to negotiate the final bill language of the $ 2 trillion stimulus , it 's growing increasingly unlikely that both chambers of Congress can give final approval to the plan tonight . 
A senior Democratic aide said that it 's unlikely the House can approve the Senate deal tonight . 
That 's because lawmakers will need time to review the details of the bill and may need to hold another conference call to discuss the elements of the Senate plan . 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to ensure that her caucus is in line because they need full cooperation to bring the bill to the floor so it can be approved by either voice vote or unanimous consent â€” so members do not have to return to Washington and vote in person . 
Similarly , a GOP Senate aide that with the time slipping and bill text still being drafted , it 's unlikely the Senate will vote tonight .
