The administration remains " deeply concerned about New York City and the New York metro area , " Dr . Deborah Birx said Tuesday , providing additional information on the hotspot and urging anyone who may have left the area to self quarantine . 
" It means , because they are still at the 31 % mortality compared to the other regions of the country , that we can have a huge impact if we unite together . 
This means that , as in all places , they have to be following the presidential guidelines … and this will be critical , " she said . 
Birx sounded an alarm for any New Yorkers who may have left the region for other parts of the country in recent days . 
" To everyone who has left New York over the last few days , because of the rate of the number of cases , you may have been exposed before you left New York and I think like Gov . 
De Santis has put out today , everybody who was in New York should be self quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus does not spread to others . 
No matter where they have gone whether it ’s Florida or North Carolina or out to the far reaches of Long Island , " she said . 
Birx said they are " starting to see new cases across Long Island : That suggest people have left the city . " 
She explained that the self quarantine should be timed based on 14 days after they left the New York area . 
President Trump would not say whether he gave New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo a heads up that guidance for New Yorkers to self quarantine was coming Tuesday . 
" We ’re talking to them about it , " Trump said as he left the briefing room , in response to a question from CNN 's Kaitlan Collins .
