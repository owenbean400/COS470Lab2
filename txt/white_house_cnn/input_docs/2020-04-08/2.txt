Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said officials are looking at areas in the United States where mitigation efforts seem to be working to determine if the social distancing guidelines currently in place could be relaxed at the end of April . 
" We 're doing a series of clear investigations of what happened in Washington and L.A . and what does that mean and how you keep the number of cases down , " Birx said today during an appearance on ABC 's " Good Morning America . " 
Birx also said officials expect to roll out an antibody test in the next 10 to 14 days " so we can really tell how many Americans were asymptomatic and infected . " 
" This makes a big difference in really understanding who can go back to work and how they can go back to work , so all of those pieces need to come together over the next couple of weeks , " Birx told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos .
