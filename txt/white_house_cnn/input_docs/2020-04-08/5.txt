When asked Wednesday if China has withheld information on the coronavirus , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that now is " not the time for retribution " and instead stressed transparency of data from China and other countries . 
China , he added , has been cooperating in many areas that the US is " deeply appreciative " of , but he did not get into additional details . 
Pompeo refrained from bashing China during the Wednesday White House briefing , changing his tune from earlier in the coronavirus pandemic . 
" This is not the time for retribution but it is still the time for clarity and transparency , " Pompeo said . 
" Every country , China included , needs to share data . "
