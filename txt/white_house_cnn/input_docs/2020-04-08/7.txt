Companies will soon be blocked from exporting critical medical supplies needed by the US for the coronavirus response , unless the Federal Emergency Management Agency gives approval for overseas shipments , according to a federal draft regulation . 
The combined effort between FEMA and US Customs and Border Protection , which oversees trade and travel , comes as the United States seeks to shore up equipment for hospitals treating coronavirus patients . 
Late last week : White House trade adviser Peter Navarro previewed these actions , saying there is " a black market which you have described , where we 're having people bid against each other , brokers come in , they 're bidding and bidding on all this different ( personal protective equipment ) . " 
In a joint statement Wednesday , the two agencies , both of which fall under the Department of Homeland Security , said they 're " working together to prevent domestic brokers , distributors , and other intermediaries from diverting these critical medical resources overseas . "
