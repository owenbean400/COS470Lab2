Multiple health experts are discussing the possibility of " pool testing " — a method of coronavirus testing that mixes several samples together into a " batch , " or pool . 
Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said the new approach could drastically expand the nation 's knowledge of how and where the virus is spreading , Birx added that there could be opportunities to do five people pools or greater , which would allow for people to return to schools sand workplaces with the ability to test on a frequent basis . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said Friday that the White House coronavirus task force is " seriously considering " pool testing for Covid 19 . 
" Something ’s not working , " Fauci said of the nation 's current approach in an interview with The Washington Post " I mean , you can do all the diagramming you want , but something is not working . " 
Here 's how Pooling works : " Pooling refers to a testing technique in which allows a lab to mix several samples together in a ' batch ' or pooled sample and then test the pooled sample with a diagnostic test . 
For example , four samples may be tested together , using only the resources needed for a single test , " Dr . Jeffrey Shuren , director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the US Food and Drug Administration , said in a written statement last week . 
" If the pooled sample is negative , it can be deduced that all patients were negative . 
If the pooled sample comes back positive , then each sample needs to be tested individually to find out which was positive , " Shuren said . 
" Because samples are pooled together , ultimately fewer tests are run overall , meaning fewer testing supplies are used , and results can be returned to patients more quickly in most cases . "
