The first White House coronavirus task force briefing in months demonstrated a " stunning disconnect " between the administration and the reality of the coronavirus pandemic , a former Baltimore city health commissioner said Friday . 
" We 're basically seeing the same picture that we saw back in March , in New York City , but in many places in the country and without a plan to be able to address it , " Wen added . 
Wen said she agreed with Vice President Mike Pence when he said the US had flattened the curve of the disease . 
" But then what happened ? " 
Wen asked . 
" When we reopened without having the capability to rein in these infections , and now all the sacrifices that people have made are going to go in vain and we still do not have a national strategy , or even recognition from the vice president that we have a problem here . " 
Wen faulted Pence for not endorsing the simple act of wearing a face covering . 
The administration , on the other hand , has touted the drug remdesivir , which helps critically ill Covid 19 patients . 
" Well , we actually have a treatment right now , if you will . 
If you wear a mask , that reduces your risk of getting coronavirus by up to five times , " Wen said . 
" Imagine that this is a medication that we can all be taking . 
This is a basic intervention that all that should be doing right now in order to save lives . "
