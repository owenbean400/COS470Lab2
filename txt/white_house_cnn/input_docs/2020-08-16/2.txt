Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said schools reopening " is a complex problem " and many things must be taken into account . 
Chicago will go all remote and has offered a program that provides 100,000 houses with free Wi Fi , according to Lightfoot . 
When asked if she thought Chicago was becoming a coronavirus hotspot because of mass gatherings , the mayor responded , " interestingly , we did not see that rise , " but did say Chicago has seen a steady increase which she attributed to the population of 18 to 29 year olds . 
" We 've got to break through to our young people that they are not immune to the virus , " Lightfoot said . 
The " chaos " at the federal level has not helped mitigate the spread , she added . 
" The White House fighting , the CDC , the HHS hijacking reporting processes , we still do not have a federal mask policy . 
The chaos at the federal level has not been helpful to anyone , not Chicago , Illinois , or states across the country , " Lightfoot said .
