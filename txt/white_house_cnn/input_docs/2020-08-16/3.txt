Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN today that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi " are looking at having a standalone bill " to provide funding to the US Postal Service . 
Asked by CNN if Democrats would agree to a standalone bill to provide money to the Postal Service , since today the White House said it would support it , Schumer said : " Speaker Pelosi and I are looking at having a standalone bill . 
The House - she can call it back into session , she can do that , I hope she will , and then I will ask Leader Mc Connell to call the Senate back into Session to do a standalone bill . " 
When asked if he spoke to Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , Schumer said he would be sending him a letter . 
More on this : Earlier today , White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN that he would be open to the idea of a standalone bill that contains only funding for the Postal Service , despite President Trump ’s calls in the last week for more USPS funding to arrive only as part of a broader stimulus package .
