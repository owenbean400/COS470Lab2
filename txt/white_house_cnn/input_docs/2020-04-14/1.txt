" Well , it 's just too early to know and ( Trump ) is talking about some time after April the 30th ; do not know exactly what timeline that looks like and he 's also indicated that what he does may not be uniformly implemented in all states at the same time , because you have ... some states that are obviously more impacted than others , " he said , adding that Louisiana is one of those hotspots .
