During a call with governors Monday , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force coordinator , warned Kentucky Gov . 
Andy Beshear that his state would likely see an increasing number of deaths from coronavirus in the coming two weeks . 
" Arizona moved through that , " she told Beshear and the other governors , " we believe that you also will . " 
Birx said the increased mortality " shows how important it is to be aggressive on the front end to have an impact on mortality on the back end . "
