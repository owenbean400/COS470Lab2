" The new phase " of the coronavirus pandemic that White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx discussed on Sunday refers to areas that are experiencing community spread , and that ’s harder to fight than contained outbreaks , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday . 
Birx said Sunday the US is in a new phase in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic , adding that the virus is now more widespread than it was in March and April . 
" When you have community spread , it 's much more difficult to get your arms around that , " Fauci said during a briefing with Connecticut Gov . 
Ned Lamont . 
Fauci explained why it can be so difficult to contain community spread of the virus . 
Fauci said asymptomatic transmission is a driving factor in community spread . 
" That 's what [ Dr . Birx ] meant by a ‘ different phase ’ of where we 're going right now , because it is not easily identifiable who these spreaders are , " said Fauci . 
" That makes it much more difficult to contain . "
