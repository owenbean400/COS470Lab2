All four negotiators are now in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office for today 's stimulus negotiations . 
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer were expected to be in the meeting . 
Asked if there should be any expectations for this meeting , Meadows responded , " None yet . " 
Some background : The meeting comes as the two sides remain far apart on many key issues regarding the next emergency aid package . 
The Senate is scheduled to leave for August recess at the end of this week , but there 's zero sense something will come together before then . 
Neither side wants to leave town for the month without reaching an agreement , but at this point , that agreement — and then the process of actually getting it through both chambers — is a long way off .
