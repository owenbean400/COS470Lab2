India has placed a blanket ban on all exports of hydroxychloroquine , just as President Donald Trump called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release more of the drug to the United States . 
In an official notification issued Saturday , India 's Ministry of Commerce and Industry amended a previous order issued last month and effectively banned all export of the drug . 
It is unclear whether the export ban was made before or after Trump and Modi spoke in a telephone call on Saturday . 
Hydroxychloroquine is an anti malaria drug that some institutions are researching for a possible Covid 19 treatment . 
Yet there is little reliable evidence that the drug is effective at treating the novel coronavirus . 
President Trump , however , has doubled down on the unproven therapy , and at a briefing at the White House on Sunday said : In India , the eligible individuals for use of the drug are " Asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid 19 and asymptomatic household contacts of people testing positive for Covid 19 . " 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said there is no " definitive information to be able to make any comment " on whether the drug can be used to treat coronavirus .
