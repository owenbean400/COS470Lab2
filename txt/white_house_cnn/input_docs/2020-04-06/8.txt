Dr . Deborah Birx , coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force , says she did not visit her grandchild despite the 10 month old having " a fever of 105 this weekend . " 
Birx shared her experience during a Monday task force briefing with reporters , while urging people in particularly high risk areas to stay home as much as possible . 
" I ’m the doctor . 
And I could not get there , " she said during the press briefing . 
" I mean , so I ’m trying to explain to my daughter how to listen to her lungs . 
How to listen to her lungs , how to listen to the baby ’s lungs … " President Donald Trump , standing feet away from Birx , asked , " But you did not get there , you did not get there ? " 
" I did not go there . 
Because of you two , " she said , gesturing toward the President and Vice President Mike Pence , who stood nearby . 
" I mean , you ca not take that kind of risk with the leaders of the country . " 
Birx said that her granddaughter is " coming out of it . " 
She stopped short of telling people not to go to the grocery store for the next week in high risk areas , but did recommend consolidating shopping trips and sending one member per family .
