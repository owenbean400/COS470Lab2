President Donald Trump called Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II " a great and wonderful woman " on Twitter , after the Queen recorded a rare televised address to the nation broadcast on Sunday . 
The Queen typically only speaks to the public during her annual Christmas message , or when there is a new parliament installed . 
The Queen 's message : She urged unity and offered reassurance for the nation during her speech . 
She thanked those who were staying at home and following social distancing rules , as well as frontline workers and medical staff . 
Contrast in the US : Trump 's praise of the Queen comes as the US struggles with its own outbreak , and as the President faces sharp criticism for his handling of the crisis . 
He has sent mixed messages to the public over the past month , offering misleading information on testing , ventilator supply , and the pandemic 's timeline . 
Trump has also contradicted medical and scientific experts on his own White House task force , and urged the economy to resume operations by Easter -- which is this coming weekend . 
" We have to open this country up , " he said last week -- even as doctors warn the nation will see a massive spike in cases if Americans return to crowded workplaces or events .
