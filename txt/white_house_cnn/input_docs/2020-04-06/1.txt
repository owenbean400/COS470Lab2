Admiral Dr . Brett Giroir , the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services , urged the country to continue social distancing efforts . 
Over the weekend by Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , urged Americans to stay home , saying " This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store , not going to the pharmacy . " 
Giroir said he agreed with Birx , and explained , " That does not mean go without medication . 
If you need to go to the pharmacy to get your medications , if you need to get groceries , do it . 
But do not go every day ... 
Do it as infrequently as possible . " 
" Anything you can do to protect yourself , to avoid yourself from getting this virus and being in the hospital for a month or potentially facing death , I think it 's advised to do that , " Giroir told NBC 's Savannah Guthrie .
