White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said he was qualified to engage and disagree with Dr . Anthony Fauci on the use of an anti malarial drug as a coronavirus treatment — which is not yet proven as effective . 
" My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I ’m a social scientist , " he told CNN ’s John Berman on " New Day . " 
" I have a Ph . D . 
And I understand how to read statistical studies , whether it ’s in medicine , the law , economics or whatever , " he added . 
CNN previously reported that a heated argument broke out in the Situation Room over the weekend , where Navarro feuded with other officials on the unproven efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus , according to sources . 
While discussing the latest on the anti malaria drug , an exasperated Navarro lashed out at Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious disease expert , who has urged caution around the drug .
