The White House is helping provide data and feedback to the institute behind an influential coronavirus model , which currently predicts about 60,000 deaths in the United States by August . 
Dr . Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) at the University of Washington , described the relationship Friday in a virtual press briefing . 
Asked whether the White House had any input or influence on new tools from the model , Murray said , " We have very regular discussions with the task force at the White House . " 
Murray â€™s institute on Friday released new projections saying that some states could begin reopening as early as May 4 , so long as measures are in place to prevent a resurgence of the virus . 
Murray said the White House has been " extremely helpful in helping get us better data , and by making contacts through different parts of the government , or with state governments , or in fact with networks of hospital providers , or providers of mobility data . " 
Working with the task force has " been a very helpful route for us getting extra , or better data , and getting data faster , " Murray said . 
He pointed out that for his modeling approach , " the data is the most important thing . " 
While the White House and others have often cited the model , Murray said that states should rely on a variety of projections when deciding when to reopen .
