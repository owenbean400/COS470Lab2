Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , was asked during CNN 's global town hall about whether a person can get re infected after getting coronavirus . 
Birx : In biology you never want to say that that 's not possible . 
Coming out of a field where we do not have an effective model of effective immunity , seeing people develop an immune response and recover and have those two linked , at least in the progress of disease we 've seen to date , is reassuring to me . 
But there 's always that small per chance a person who does not make effective antibody or for another reason does not have effective neutrophils , or points out a little defect that was not ever discovered in their genetic response -- their immune response to a specific virus . 
Those outliers always exist , but right now we do not have an evidence that that 's a common thing that we see . 
Cooper : But we do not know 100 % for sure if someone is immune after getting the virus ? 
Birx : What we have the example of is the biology of someone getting infected , recovering and developing antibody . 
So in traditional infectious disease , that is the progress you would normally see and that antibody would be effective in controlling subsequent infections . 
I do not ever want to say never , but that 's what we 're seeing in most patients is that they recover and they have antibody .
