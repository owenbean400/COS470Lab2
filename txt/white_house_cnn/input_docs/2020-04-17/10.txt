Dr . Chris Murray , the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , said cell phone data anonymized and shared with his research team shows that people by and large are following social distancing policies . 
The institute 's coronavirus modeling is being used by the White House to craft its response to the pandemic . 
" We 've made a big push to try to take into account how people move around , " Murray told CNN 's coronavirus town hall . 
Murray said it appears that several states in the southern US may have smaller epidemics than previously expected . 
He added that the national peak is expected to hit now , but cautioned that different states will see their peaks at different times . 
" That 's going to be really important for this idea of rolling opening ( of economies ) , " Murray said . 
" We 're trying to get a deeper understanding of where states are still on the upswing and where states are on the downswing . "
