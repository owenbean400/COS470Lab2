Some US states may be able to relax some aspects of social distancing measures as early as May 4 , according to the researchers behind an influential model often cited by the White House . 
The relaxations could come so long as " robust containment strategies " are implemented to prevent a second wave of infections , according to a statement from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington ( IHME ) . 
The states that could open as early as May 4 include Vermont , West Virginia , Montana and Hawaii . 
However , other states – including Iowa , North Dakota , South Dakota , Nebraska , Utah , Arkansas and Oklahoma – may need to wait until late June or early July , according to IHME . 
Strategies for safely relaxing some social distancing include widely implemented testing , contact tracing and isolation of confirmed cases , and restricting large gatherings , according to the researchers . 
The modelers cautioned that decisions by states to relax social distancing should be informed by meeting critical metrics closer to these dates , including a very low number of estimated infections in the community – less than one estimated infection per 1 million people . 
More data : The researchers announced that the peak number of daily deaths in the US may have peaked two days ago , and the model is now estimating 60,308 ( estimated range of 34,063 to 140,381 ) deaths across the US by August 4 , down from 68,841 as predicted on April 13 . 
The estimates for total US deaths have been revised downward based in part on newly available cell phone data that provide a window on mobility patterns , according to IHME . 
" We are seeing the numbers decline because some state and local governments , and , equally important , individuals around the country have stepped up to protect their families , their neighbors , and friends and coworkers by reducing physical contact , " IHME director Dr . Christopher Murray said in a statement .
