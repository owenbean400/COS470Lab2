Pelosi reiterated that Democrats are not interested in a short term deal ahead of her and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer 's meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows . 
Some context : The unemployment benefit that has kept millions afloat amid the worst economic crisis in decades officially expired at midnight Friday . 
Weekly jobless claims continue to rise . 
Economic forecasters are warning of another slowdown . 
The coronavirus has resurged across the country . 
The US Senate has adjourned for the weekend . 
President Trump said Mnuchin and Meadows would bring new options on unemployment benefits to the table Thursday night , and according to a person briefed on the talks , they did in the form of a longer term extension of the enhanced unemployment benefits at the $ 600 level . 
Democrats again rejected the idea of decoupling the benefit extension from the broader talks . 
There was tangential progress made in the sense that new proposals were put on the table and there was more depth in the talks about how to structure a proposal , the person said . 
But the separation between the two sides is still enormous .
