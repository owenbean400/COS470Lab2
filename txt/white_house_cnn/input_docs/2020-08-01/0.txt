Researchers on Wednesday published scathing critiques of a study President Trump repeatedly touted on Twitter . 
That study , published earlier this month in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases , claimed to show that hydroxychloroquine saved lives . 
President Trump tweeted about it enthusiastically . 
" The highly respected Henry Ford Health System just reported , based on a large sampling , that HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE cut the death rate in certain sick patients very significantly .

" As a result of the flaws in the analysis the conclusions reached in [ the study ] are invalid , " Graham Atkinson , an independent consultant in health care policy , wrote in one of the letters . 
The study was conducted at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit . 
It contradicts many other studies , which have found the drug does not help Covid 19 patients .
