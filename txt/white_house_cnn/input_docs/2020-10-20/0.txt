The United States is unlikely to have a Covid 19 vaccine authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration before late November at the earliest , according to Dr . Francis Collins , director of the US National Institutes of Health . 
" These will be vaccines that are tested with the most rigorous standards for safety and efficacy , " Collins said . 
" If we get to the point by sometime , maybe the end of this year , where one or more of those is judged to be safe and effective , it will be because it 's safe and effective . " 
The White House Coronavirus Task Force still meets at least once a week with the Vice President to discuss issues such as " the worsening of the pandemic in the middle of the country , " Collins added . 
Dr . Scott Atlas , who has made controversial comments about mask wearing recently , serves as the White House coronavirus adviser . 
After Donald Trump 's attack on Dr Anthony Fauci , Collins said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was " probably the most highly respected infectious disease expert in the world , " adding : " I have great confidence in him . " 
Collins also warned that the US " never got over the first wave " of the virus that hit New York particularly hard , saying " we never really drove the cases down to the baseline . " 
He said this was because the US had not succeeded in introducing " really effective public health measures " such as mask wearing , social distancing and handwashing , adding that his family will not be gathering for Thanksgiving this year .
