Dr . Anthony Fauci brushed off President Trump 's attacks on him on Monday , calling them a " distraction " and emphasizing that he just wants to do his job . 
Asked in an interview with KNX Radio in Los Angeles whether he ever feels like leaving his role at the White House due to Trump 's attacks , Fauci responded with a quote from " The Godfather . " 
" It depends if you take it personally . 
I focus totally on the health and the welfare of the people of this country . 
That 's what I devoted 50 years of my career towards , " Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said . 
Earlier Monday , President Trump claimed during a campaign call that people were tired of hearing about the coronavirus pandemic and criticized Fauci , calling him a " disaster . " 
" I would prefer not to comment on that and to just get on with what we 're really trying to do , " Fauci said . 
" Many , many states that had been doing reasonably well are now showing upticks . 
That 's what we should be concentrating on , " Fauci said . 
" All that other stuff is a distraction and I would really prefer to stay away from that . " 
Fauci added that : " In this country , there is a fatigue of Covid . 
We 've been dealing with this now for almost nine months . "
