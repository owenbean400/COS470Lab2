One state official told CNN they had been working all weekend to understand the new rules , and had been on the phone with the White House several times . 
" It ’s a high level order without a lot details filled in . 
We are working really hard to understand the conditions , " said the official in a phone call . 
" There are a lot of unknowns . " 
Another official at a major West Coast airport told CNN , " Everyone has been trying to nail down clarifications on the travel ban . " 
The West Coast official ’s airport is one of the 11 that will handle enhanced screenings for coronavirus .
