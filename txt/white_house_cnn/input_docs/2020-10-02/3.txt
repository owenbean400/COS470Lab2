The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a $ 2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus proposal put forward by House Democrats with no bipartisan deal in sight even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have continued talks in an effort to reach an agreement . 
The measure passed largely along party lines amid GOP opposition with a final tally of 214-207 . 
Eighteen Democrats crossed party lines to vote against the bill , while Republicans were united in opposition . 
The legislation will give Democrats something to point to as lawmakers face pressure from constituents to deliver more aid as the pandemic continues to take a devastating toll across America . 
But the Democratic plan has been rejected by Republicans as too costly and is not expected to be taken up by the GOP led Senate , and time is quickly running out to clinch a bipartisan agreement that could be signed into law ahead of the November elections . 
Pelosi , as she walked off the House floor , told a group of reporters Thursday evening ahead of the vote that there will be no agreement on any stimulus deal tonight , but talks with Mnuchin will continue . 
Some context : Both the White House and House Democratic leaders are struggling with internal party divisions over how to move forward in the stimulus talks . 
For months , moderate Democrats in the House have been pushing their leadership to go back to the table and get a deal with the White House on stimulus rather than forging ahead with another Democratic only package . 
Fourteen Democratic members voted against the original Heroes Act back in the spring , arguing it was not a plan that was going to be signed by the President . 
The legislation voted on Thursday has been referred to by House Democrats as an updated version of the Heroes Act .
