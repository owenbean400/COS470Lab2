After the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of self swab testing for the novel coronavirus , it will be implemented this week , said Adm . Dr . Brett P . Giroir , assistant secretary for US Department of Health and Human Services during a White House press conference Sunday evening . 
With this approval , people with suspected coronavirus can use a foam swab in their nose to collect a nasal sample that they then would put in a plastic bag and submit for testing . 
Self swab testing not only could be more comfortable for the general public , but Giroir said that it also eliminates the need for health care workers to change their personal protective equipment each time a test is performed . 
" Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose , that 's uncomfortable but it also requires PPE changes every time it 's done , " Giroir said .
