Three former United States presidents -- Barack Obama , George W . Bush and Bill Clinton -- are volunteering to receive their Covid 19 vaccines on camera in order to promote public confidence in the medication 's safety . 
The three former presidents hope an awareness campaign to promote confidence in the vaccine 's safety and effectiveness would be a powerful message as American public health officials try to convince the public to get vaccinated once the US Food and Drug Administration authorizes one . 
Freddy Ford , Bush 's chief of staff , told CNN that the 43rd president had reached out to Dr . Anthony Fauci -- the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- and Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , to see how he could help promote the vaccine . 
Clinton 's press secretary told CNN on Wednesday that he too would be willing to take the vaccine in a public setting in order to promote it . 
It has been previously reported that Obama said in an interview with Sirius XM host Joe Madison , scheduled to air Thursday , that if Fauci said a coronavirus vaccine is safe , he believes him .
