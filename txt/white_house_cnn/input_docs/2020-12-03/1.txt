Delta Air Lines said it will begin asking international travelers coming into the United States for coronavirus contact tracing information . 
In a new memo released Thursday , Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said passengers can voluntarily submit their name , address , email and two phone numbers to " provide essential tracing information directly to the Centers for Disease Control , if needed . " 
No major coronavirus outbreaks have been traced to a commercial airline flight in the United States — but there have not been any widespread tracing efforts . 
Delta ’s move is a first by a US carrier after the White House coronavirus task force asked airlines to administer contact tracing programs themselves rather than having the government handle . 
In June , Vice President Mike Pence told major airlines to move forward with an industry led solution for contact tracing of passengers .
