Dr . Anthony Fauci did not consent to being featured in a new advertisement from the Trump campaign touting President Donald Trump 's handling of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Instead , the nation 's leading infectious disease expert told CNN his words were taken out of context . 
The Trump campaign released the new ad last week after the President was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center following treatment for Covid 19 . 
The 30 second ad , which is airing in Michigan , touts Trump 's personal experience with the virus and uses a quote from Fauci in an attempt to make it appear as if he is praising Trump 's response . 
" President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus , and so is America , " the ad 's narrator says . 
" Together we rose to meet the challenge , protecting our seniors , getting them life saving drugs in record time , sparing no expense . " 
The ad then flashes to an interview with Fauci in which he says , " I ca not imagine that anybody could be doing more . " 
Though no date is provided in the ad , Fauci 's quote is from an interview with Fox News in March . 
During that interview , Fauci praised the White House coronavirus task force 's round the clock effort to respond to the pandemic , which he says included numerous White House meetings and late night phone calls .
