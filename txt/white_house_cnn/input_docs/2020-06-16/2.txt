If and when an Operation Warp Speed Covid 19 vaccine is approved , it will be free for vulnerable populations , essential workers and any American who wants it but cannot afford it , a senior Trump administration official said during a briefing on Tuesday . 
As a condition of receiving support from Operation Warp Speed , the White House â€™s plan to accelerate a vaccine for Covid 19 , companies will provide the US government with vaccines . 
The administration describes this as a measure to make the products affordable for Americans . 
Operation Warp Speed will also assist in the distribution of a vaccine to Americans through retail pharmacies and physician offices , officials said .
