White House trade adviser Peter Navarro echoed remarks from last night during a Wednesday appearance on Bloomberg , calling for additional stimulus to help the economic recovery . 
He noted today ’s " uptick " in jobless claims and personal income levels going down . 
He declined to say whether he supports Mnuchin ’s decision to end emergency lending programs at the end of the year . 
" That ’s for Sec . 
Mnuchin to have that conversation , " he said , calling for a targeted phase four relief bill that could include a " top up " of the Paycheck Protection Program and extending unemployment insurance . 
" People are hurting , that ’s going to hurt consumer spending and the like , " he said . 
" What we need is a fiscal bridge to the point where the vaccines kick in . " 
He told reporters afterward that the jobless claims are a " good , bad , and an ugly story , " citing additional data on homebuilding and other metrics . 
The uptick in jobless claims is " of concern , " he said as PPP and compensation programs get exhausted . 
" What I ’m worried about is there ’s millions of Americans who are at risk for falling into this chasm where they do not have sufficient support , and this is why a phase four program on a bipartisan level is so important , " he said – neglecting to mention that the Trump administration has been part of the negotiation stalemate . 
He declined to take a question on government funding or stimulus talks , saying he was not privy to those conversations . 
" There ’s clearly some issues ahead that we need to deal with now , " he said .
