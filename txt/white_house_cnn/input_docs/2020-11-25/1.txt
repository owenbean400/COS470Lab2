The White House is strongly considering lifting sweeping restrictions on travel from the European Union and the United Kingdom , an administration official confirmed . 
Discussions have been ongoing for several weeks about lifting the restrictions , which ban entry to most foreigners who have been to Europe in the two weeks before their arrival in the US . 
Reuters first reported on the discussions . 
An administration official told CNN that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expressed some reservations about lifting the restrictions , but the agency is not expected to block the move . 
The discussions come at a time when the US is experiencing its worst surge of coronavirus , and as many European countries also face higher levels of coronavirus cases . 
President Trump has yet to sign off on the move , but once he does , the restrictions are unlikely to be lifted until the US and European countries have established a protocol for safe travel between the two countries . 
The White House did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention directed CNN to the White House and the Health and Human Services Department when asked for comment . 
Trump first banned most travel from the European Union and UK in March as the pandemic escalated . 
The EU soon followed suit , restricting most travel from the US and other countries .
