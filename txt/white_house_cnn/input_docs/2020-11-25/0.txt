With millions of Americans ignoring guidelines against holiday travel , the United States could see an explosion of Covid 19 infections in the weeks following Thanksgiving , CNN medical analyst Dr . Jonathan Reiner said Tuesday . 
" One of the ways we think the Midwest was seeded with virus during the summer was with the Sturgis , South Dakota , motorcycle rally where people were infected and then dispersed out through the Midwest . " 
" Now imagine that on a massive scale -- people leaving from every airport in the United States , and carrying virus with them , " he added . 
Why tests do not guarantee safe travel : Reiner cautioned that testing does not always reveal whether someone is infected at a given point in time . 
For example , if a person is infected with Covid 19 and has a test a day or two later , there might not be enough viral RNA to detect the virus , he said . 
So , testing as a litmus test for traveling wo not work , unless it reveals a positive result and the person stays home as a result , Reiner said . 
White House warning : Reiner also said he â€™s opposed to White House plans for Christmas parties this year .
