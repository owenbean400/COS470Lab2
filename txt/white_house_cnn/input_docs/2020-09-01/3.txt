Admiral Brett Giroir , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said Tuesday he does not want to answer any more questions about when every American can quickly and cheaply get a Covid 19 test . 
The assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services , who is leading Covid 19 testing efforts , said that the country now has a " huge diversity " of tests , including a $ 5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes . 
" There is no stone unturned , there is no technology that we ’re not looking at , or investing in if it ’s promising , " Giroir said . 
" We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day . 
We can do that . 
We ’re showing we can do that . 
" There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning , pass through a tricorder and tell whether they ’re infected or not , we are not there yet , " Giroir said , referring to a fictional handheld device from the " Star Trek " universe that can scan and record data by waving the instrument over someone . 
Giroir said the administration has been " trawling the world " for technology that will advance testing . 
" So , I do not want to answer any more ‘ when is that day going to happen , ’ because I ca not tell you , " Giroir said . 
" It may never happen . 
" But until it does , if it ever does , we have a plan , the plan ’s working , and we 're embellishing that plan every single day . "
