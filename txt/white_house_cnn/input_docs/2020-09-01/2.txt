Admiral Brett Giroir , a member of the White House coronavirus task force and assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services , said Tuesday that if Americans do what they are supposed to during the Labor Day weekend , the US should be in " really good shape going into the fall . " 
Giroir said the US has conducted more than 85 million tests for Covid 19 , and there has been a 5.35 % positivity rate in the past seven days . 
For the past seven days , turnaround time for the tests has decreased , Giroir said ; 
91.9 % of results from major referral labs ( which do about half the tests in the US ) were completed in three days . 
The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days . 
Deaths are down 10 % from their recent peak seven day average , he said . 
" Why are we seeing the success ? 
Because the national strategy is working , " Giroir , who is leading for Covid 19 diagnostic testing efforts . 
" We cannot let up . 
Seven states still have greater than 10 % positivity . "
