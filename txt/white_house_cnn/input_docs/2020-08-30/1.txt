White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said on Sunday that Covid 19 is a serious threat , but the knowledge that has been gained over the last six months means we have power against it . 
Birx said while it â€™s true that Covid 19 is a more serious threat to certain individuals , we still do not know for sure who those people are . 
Birx said that over the last six months , we have learned more about why masks are important , that homemade cloth two ply masks work well , that you have to cover your mouth and nose , that physical distancing is important , and that crowds -- both indoors and outdoors -- can and have spread the virus .
