White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said Sunday that people need to ensure they are taking their public mitigation efforts home with them , when necessary . 
Across the country , experts have seen that people sometimes make assumptions when gathering in private that " there could not be anybody that has infection there , " Birx said during a press event in Minnesota . 
Because of this , they do not wear masks when interacting , which leads to the virus spreading among family members and neighbors . 
Birx urged people who may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus to wear masks when interacting with those who may be more vulnerable to severe outcomes of Covid 19 , and to try to get tested . 
When someone knows they have done things that may have exposed them to the virus is when they really have to work on protecting others , she said .
