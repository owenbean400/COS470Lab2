White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said that while she is hopeful for a vaccine , she is also convinced that community spread can be stopped right now . 
Speaking at a media event in Minnesota Sunday , Birx said that people should not wait for a vaccine to do the right thing . 
Birx also said that she is hopeful that when the data becomes available and the American people can see that a vaccine is safe and effective , that they will want to get vaccinated . 
" Yes , I ’m hopeful for a vaccine , " she said . 
" But I ’m also very convinced right now that we can stop community spread by wearing masks , socially distancing and avoiding crowds . " 
Birx pointed out that crowds are not just things like large concerts , but also backyard barbecues with 25 people who are not wearing masks .
