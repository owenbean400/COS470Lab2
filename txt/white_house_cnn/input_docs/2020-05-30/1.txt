The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will resume its regular briefings as the administration continues its coronavirus response , CNN has learned . 
The CDC held a briefing Friday in which director Robert Redfield said the agency was " never blind " to the early spread of the coronavirus in the United States . 
That session was the first of the resumption of the regular press briefings , a senior Health and Human Services official told CNN . 
Some context : The last of the regular briefings was on March 9 . 
That is a short time after a top CDC official , Dr . Nancy Messonier , the agency ’s director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , surprised the Trump administration by predicting the coronavirus would be spreading more rapidly at a time when the White House was downplaying the seriousness of it . 
Her comments sent the stock market tumbling and in turn , angered President Trump . 
The move comes as the White House has been under fire recently for sidelining the administration ’s health experts on its own coronavirus task force . 
The doctors , including Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci , have appeared less and less as the country begins to reopen , despite fears of a potential resurgence .
