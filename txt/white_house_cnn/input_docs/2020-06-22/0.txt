Dr . Zeke Emanuel , who was a health care adviser to President Barack Obama and is currently an adviser to Joe Biden ’s presidential campaign , says he spoke with President Trump in February about the White House ’s response to Covid 19 . 
" You 've got to do what , say , Lyndon Johnson would have done , or Franklin Roosevelt would have done , which is you create a tornado of activity , " Emanuel said he told Trump . 
" So you 've got a task force that deals with testing . 
You 've got a task force that deals with PPE . 
You 've got a task force that deals with ventilators . 
You ’ve got a task force that deals with contact tracing . " 
The one small task force that was created at the White House " was totally inadequate , " Emanuel told Dr . Sanjay Gupta during a taping of Gupta ’s CNN podcast , " Coronavirus : Fact vs . Fiction . " 
Masks should not be up for debate : Emanuel also said that wearing masks should not be contentious . 
" Closing down businesses – it 's clear what the cost is . 
Wearing a mask – there 's no cost . 
And I think we got it wrong , " he said . 
" The public health and the economics are intimately related , " Emanuel said . 
" You cannot solve one without solving the other . 
And I do think that 's critical – understanding it . 
And I know that the Biden campaign understands that . 
I do not think the current administration wants to believe that . " 
Emanuel , who is an oncologist , compared the government ’s Covid 19 response to cancer treatments , saying the United States should have imposed a more stringent lockdown for a shorter period of time . 
" We dribbled it out , and dribbling it out is both prolonging it and making it much less effective in terms of bringing the cases and the total number of deaths down , " he said .
