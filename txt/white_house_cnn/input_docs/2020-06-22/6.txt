Although a spike in coronavirus cases in Washington , DC caused the data to reset backwards over the weekend — making Monday the 13th sustained day of a decline in community spread – Mayor Muriel Bowser said the District hit the metric of 14 sustained days on Friday , and therefore phase two of reopening is officially effective today . 
Bowser urged residents to continue to exercise " good judgement " and adhere to public health guidance . 
Here 's what 's reopening in phase two : Nonessential retail can open at 50 % capacity . 
Restaurants can have indoor dining at 50 % capacity . 
Fitness facilities may reopen with limited access ( five people per 1,000 square feet ) , strong safeguards and physical distancing Houses of worship are encouraged to hold virtual services , but are permitted to have up to 100 people , or 50 % capacity . 
DC recommends that churches do not have choirs or singing . 
Personal services , including nail care , tattooing and waxing will be permitted with certain restrictions in place . 
Gatherings of more than 50 people are still banned . 
The mayor was also asked about the announcement Friday that July 4 celebrations at the White House will include a fireworks display over the National Mall . 
Bowser said the celebration will be a federal event held on federal property and that she has been in ongoing conversations with US Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and it is not yet clear what the scope of the event will be . 
In response to a question about crowd control , Bowser said she expects there to be some traffic mitigation led by the federal government with possible assistance from local law enforcement . 
She noted that such efforts usually take place due to the holiday parade , which will not take place this year .
