Dr . Robert Redfield , director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , shook his head when shown a photo of a crowd at the Lake of Ozarks , Missouri that was taken over Memorial Day weekend . 
States are opening before they have met the criteria laid out by the White House for safe lifting of pandemic restrictions , he said . 
" We continue to try to figure out how to penetrate the message with different groups , [ and ] the pictures that the chairwoman showed me are great examples of serious problems , " the CDC director said . 
White House guidance says that all states must have the ability to trace contacts for confirmed Covid 19 cases . 
But Missouri does not have the ability to do this tracing , House Appropriations committee chair Rosa De Lauro said .
