US President Donald Trump said he has asked that the G7 meeting be postponed until after the US presidential election in November , after a previous delay due to Covid 19 concerns . 
The summit was slated to be held at Camp David in June , and after a tentative plan to postpone the meeting and switch to a virtual conference , Trump had floated in May the idea of doing it in person in the fall . 
Trump said the White House had not yet formally invited leaders . 
" We have not sent out invitations . 
We ’re talking to them , " he said . 
He noted he planned on inviting countries that are not formal members of the group of seven . 
Asked whether he would invite Russian President Vladimir Putin , Trump said he would do so because Putin is an " important factor . " 
" I certainly would invite him to the meeting . 
I think he ’s an important factor . "
