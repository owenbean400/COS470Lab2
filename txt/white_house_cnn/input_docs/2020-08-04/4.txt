Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell again blasted Democratic leadership over inaction on the stimulus bill , which he called a " charade . " 
He argued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are " obstructing any action for our country , " even as Pelosi and Schumer continue to meet with administration officials almost daily , all of which , Mc Connell has not been participating in . 
" What did the Speaker of the House and the Democratic Leader do with yet another day of deliberations , " Mc Connell asked during a heated speech . 
" Yet again , it was the exact same refrain . 
It never seems to change . " 
" ‘ We 're feeling optimistic , ’ ' We spoke very politely to the administration , but we 're still nowhere close on substance , ’ " Mc Connell said mockingly of remarks the Democratic leaders have made leaving meetings with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in the last two weeks . 
He continued , " Here 's the problem : Every day the Democratic leaders repeat the same actor in the Capitol they 're letting down the struggling people who need our help . " 
Mc Connell also pointed to the Republican ’s HEALS Act and said " the Democrats are blocking it all . " 
" It ’s like they expect applause for merely keeping a civil tone with the President ’s team , never mind they ’re still obstructing any action for our country , " he said . 
Mc Connell added : " What American families need is an outcome . "
