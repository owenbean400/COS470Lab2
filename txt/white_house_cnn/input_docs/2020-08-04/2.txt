In the US , the spread of the virus is more widespread than ever before , prompting White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx to say over the weekend the country has entered a " new phase " of the pandemic . 
But there are some states that have gotten it right by not letting up on restrictions after their case numbers began dipping . 
Among them , Connecticut , which has one of the lowest infection rates in the country . 
The state is in its second phase of reopening , where restaurants are limited to 50 % indoor capacity and bars — which health officials across the country have said fueled the spread of the virus — remain closed . 
All businesses that reopen must first certify with the state they are following coronavirus related guidelines . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , praised the state Monday . 
Other states , like New York , which were slower to reopen , lifted restrictions by regions , and are cracking down on individuals and businesses not adhering to guidelines , are also reporting good news . 
New York 's positivity rate over the weekend was lower than 1 % , the governor said . 
Across the country , more than 4.7 million have been infected since the start of the pandemic and at least 155,469 have died . 
Health officials project there will be thousands more deaths in the coming weeks .
