US President Donald Trump has credited doctors and scientists for doing an " incredible " job against the coronavirus in a short period of time . 
Trump has often disregarded the guidance of his own scientists and federal public health agencies as the pandemic ravaged parts of the US . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of Trump â€™s coronavirus task force , said Friday that a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House two weeks ago was a " superspreader " event . 
Trump admitted during the Fox interview he may have caught the virus at a White House event , but he does not know for sure . 
Trump was diagnosed with Covid 19 last week and seemed to make a speedy recovery after a round of treatments , including an experimental monoclonal antibody therapy , the antiviral medication remdesivir , and the steroid dexamethasone .
