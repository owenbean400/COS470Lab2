As President Trump hosts supporters at the White House for his first public event since testing positive for coronavirus , the Democratic National Committee War Room is planning a spectacle of its own . 
From 11 a.m . to 6 p.m . , a mobile billboard is expected to roam the streets around the White House to call attention to the Trump administration â€™s coronavirus response , and how , per the DNC War Room , Trump is " still putting lives at risk . " 
The billboard truck is expected to feature a screen with rotating pandemic statistics , including 7.7 million coronavirus cases in the US , 213,000 US deaths , 657,000 children infected , 400,000 businesses closed for good , and 40 million Americans at risk of being evicted by the end of the year . 
And the truck will play audio of Dr . Anthony Fauci , who told CBS News Radio in an interview this week , " We had a superspreader event in the White House . " 
" Even after the White House has been turned into a hotspot in this pandemic , Trump still has not learned his lesson or started listening to his own public health experts , " DNC War Room spokesperson Lily Adams said in a statement . 
" Instead , he is doubling down with another potential superspreader event today and a return to rallies next week . "
