Any effort to authorize and distribute a coronavirus vaccine before it has been proven safe and effective in large trials could damage efforts to develop other vaccines , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told Reuters Monday . 
Two sources have told CNN that White House officials have raised the possibility of an early emergency use authorization of a vaccine – before late stage trials are finished . 
Michael Caputo , the assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Department of Health and Human Services , denied that there was any effort to fast track vaccine development for political purposes . 
And Fauci said it would be a bad idea . 
" The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA before you have a signal of efficacy , " Reuters quoted Fauci as saying . 
" One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult , if not impossible , for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial . " 
Several vaccines are being tested in the US and companies are working to ramp up production while testing is going on , so that if a vaccine is proven safe and effective it could be distributed immediately . 
" To me , it ’s absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective , both , " Fauci told Reuters . 
" We would hope that nothing interferes with the full demonstration that a vaccine is safe and effective . "
