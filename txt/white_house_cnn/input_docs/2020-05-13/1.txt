A key coronavirus model often cited by the White House has again raised its coronavirus death projection , now predicting 147,000 deaths in the US by August 4 . 
That ’s an increase of about 10,000 deaths compared to the model ’s estimate from this weekend , which was already higher than earlier projections . 
On Sunday , Dr . Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , tied the earlier increase to " explosive increases in mobility in a number of states . " 
Compared to Sunday , the model now projects about 2,450 additional deaths in New York , 2,000 additional deaths in Massachusetts and 1,700 additional deaths in Pennsylvania . 
Other states saw sizable increases as well . 
North Carolina , for example , is now expected to see about 3,200 more deaths , and Maryland about 1,200 more . 
Some states saw decreases in projected deaths , however , including Georgia , which is now expected to see 1,500 fewer deaths . 
The model ’s projection for Indiana has also gone down by 1,600 deaths . 
On its website , IHME said exact reasons for the changes vary by state . 
But the institute pointed to " epidemiological indicators and key drivers of viral transmission , " like changes in testing and mobility .
