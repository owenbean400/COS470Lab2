The researcher behind the influential model the White House often cites when talking about projected novel coronavirus cases told CNN ’s Don Lemon on Tuesday that a decision by states to reopen will increase US deaths . 
Dr . Chris Murray said his model now projects 147,000 deaths in the US by August . 
That projection is up 10,000 deaths from two days ago and more than double what was projected two weeks ago . Murray is the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation . 
He ’s seeing more people gathering in groups , like they did in his neighborhood for Mother ’s Day he said , and with that mingling comes new cases . 
" And that ’s playing out in the projections , unfortunately , " Murray said . 
The numbers could increase even more as additional states loosen stay at home mandates , he added . 
Death numbers are slowly declining , but each additional interaction brings greater risk of transmission . 
Murray said he hopes testing will increase , but additional testing is already accounted for in their model . 
The wild card , he said , could be warmer temperatures . 
Flu cases decline in the summer , but with the novel coronavirus , scientists do not know if that will happen . 
" That ’s the thing about a new pandemic , we just do not know everything , " Murray said .
