During Monday 's White House coronavirus task force briefing , Trump claimed that the Paycheck Protection Program -- a small businesses lending program -- has " really been performing well . " 
Trump said there were a few " minor glitches that have already been taken care of . " 
Facts First : CNN has reported significant issues to the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) , with system wide failures as lenders process these loans . 
Days after the launch of the Small Business Administration 's rollout of the PPP , there are still delays in the system lenders use to upload loan application information and the money is still largely not going out to the businesses that need it yet . 
According to an industry source who spoke to CNN , major system wide failures continue to crop up in the PPP system , including shutdowns preventing the submission of applications from lenders on their system known as E Tran . 
These issues have slowed down the ability for banks to participate in the loan program , this source tells CNN . 
Additionally , several bank executives tell CNN they want the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration to offer more guidance on how they are supposed to disburse funds . 
CNN reporting indicates there are also concerns among lenders who say they wo not cut checks until there is clear guidance on how they should distribute the money .
