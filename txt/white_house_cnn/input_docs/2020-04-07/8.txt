Illinois state officials are frustrated with the federal government 's response and states ' ability to get much needed supplies in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Illinois State Comptroller Susana Mendoza said she sent someone from her staff to a Mc Donald 's with a check for $ 3.4 million to pay a middle man to get masks twice . 
" This is what we resorted to as a state . 
It feels like you 're almost doing a sketchy drug deal on the road , when in fact you 're trying to save people 's lives , " Mendoza told Anderson Cooper . 
She said states should not have to compete with other states for supplies . 
The absence of coherent guidelines from the White House has created a battle among states and hospitals , which have been hooked into bidding wars over key provisions to combat the pandemic . 
Mendoza said the federal government promised the state " tens of thousands " of pieces of personal protection equipment and tests , but Illinois only received about 3 % of what they asked for . 
" It would be nice to have a coordinated federal response to this crisis , and it 's just a little too late . 
They could have done so much more so much earlier . 
It 's a shame , " she said . 
Illinois has 12,264 cases of coronavirus and 308 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins .
