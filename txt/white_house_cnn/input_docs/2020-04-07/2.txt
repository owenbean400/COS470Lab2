US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said that the majority of people in the United States are " doing the right thing " by staying home , social distancing and following other mitigation measures to help fight the coronavirus pandemic . 
" I want the American people to know there is a light at the end of this tunnel and we feel confident if we keep doing the right thing for the rest of this month that we can start to slowly reopen in some places , " Adams said Tuesday morning . 
The US coronavirus death toll is nearing 11,000 as the country prepares for what the President said will be a " difficult " week and a half . 
But White House officials say they are encouraged by parts of the country that leaned in heavily to social distancing measures and are now seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth of coronavirus cases . 
" I 'm seeing mitigation work , " Adams said Tuesday . 
" I am so impressed . 
I know I 've said it a couple times with Washington and with California . 
Their public health officials there should be applauded because they 've given us the blueprint for how we deal with this and the rest of the country . "
