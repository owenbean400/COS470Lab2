President Donald Trump and Dr . Anthony Fauci on Tuesday discussed the disproportionate impact the coronavirus is having on African Americans . 
" We ’re actively engaging on the problem of increased impacts -- this is a real problem and it ’s showing up very strongly in our data -- on the African American community . 
And we ’re doing everything in our power to address this challenge . 
It ’s a tremendous challenge . 
It ’s terrible , " Trump said during a White House press briefing from the coronavirus task force . 
He continued , " It ’s been disproportional . 
They ’re getting hit very hard . " 
Fauci , the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases , called the issue an " exacerbation of a health disparity . " 
" We ’ve known , literally forever , that diseases like diabetes , hypertension , obesity and asthma are disproportionally afflicting the minority populations , particularly the African Americans , " Fauci said . 
" Unfortunately , when you look at the predisposing conditions that lead to a bad outcome with coronavirus , the things that get people into ICUs , that require intubation and often lead to death , they ’re just those very comorbidities that are unfortunately disproportionately prevalent in the African American population . " 
He added , " It ’s very sad . 
There ’s nothing we can do about it now except try and give them the best possible care to avoid those complications . "
