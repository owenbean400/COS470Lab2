Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNN that Democrats will need to be the ones to make the next move if stimulus talks between the administration and congressional Democrats are to restart . 
He said Democratic leaders need to accept a lower amount of assistance for state and local governments . 
" Anytime they have another offer to make , they can either call me or I ’ll go up and see them , " Mnuchin said . 
" But they have to compromise . " 
" I think we ’ve been very clear that they need to come back with a compromise on the state and local from their trillion dollars , and the unemployment benefits , and if so we ’ll respond . 
I think the majority of the other issues , we ’ve reached a compromise on , " Mnuchin added at the White House on Sunday . 
In an interview on " Fox News Sunday , " Mnuchin said that although governors are asking for money , they do not need $ 1 trillion .
