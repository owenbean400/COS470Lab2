The US Food and Drug Administration must avoid repeating the mistakes it made with some coronavirus treatments in the race to approve a safe and effective Covid 19 vaccine , Dr . Vivek Murthy , former US surgeon general , told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer Monday . 
Some background : The FDA gave emergency use authorization to both convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine in decisions that are widely viewed as having been influenced by political pressure – and that the White House trumpeted both EUA decisions as breakthroughs . 
Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to not be helpful , and the FDA withdrew the EUA for that treatment against coronavirus . 
Doctors say calling convalescent plasma a breakthrough is a gross exaggeration , although few question the EUA decision itself . 
Murthy commented on a Wall Street Journal report , as yet unconfirmed , that vaccine makers including Pfizer , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson plan to sign a pledge promising to only seek approval for their coronavirus vaccine candidates once they ’re proven safe and effective . 
Murthy said he hoped it would help increase public confidence in an eventual vaccine . 
" They also probably realize what 's at stake here , which is that if the public does not have faith in a vaccine , then everyone suffers , " said Murthy .
