White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that another stimulus package – called phase four – might not be necessary . 
In a gaggle with reporters after his Fox appearance , Hassett seemed to imply that there would be some sort of additional stimulus package but that a potential phase four deal might be geared more toward " growth and taking off and recovering , rather than just building a bridge to recovery . " 
Some context : President Trump said earlier in the week that he would look at funding for states in a potential phase four stimulus package but that " we want to take a little bit of a pause " before passing such a package . 
Trump said that Republicans are in a much better negotiating position on funding for states and if they agree to it , Republicans " have to get something for it . " 
Hassett said that aid to states " will be a political issue that will be worked out between Republicans and Democrats on the Hill " but that President Trump " is absolutely opposed to bailouts . " 
On opening up the economy , Hassett said that " probably by the end of May , almost every state will be mostly open economically " but added that economic numbers over the next few months will be " as bad as you 've ever seen . "
