Large crowds flocked to the National Mall in Washington , DC , on Saturday to view the flyover of the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds honoring essential workers , according to social media posts showing large crowds . 
The crowds gathered despite a stay at home order in Washington , DC , and requests from the Blue Angels , DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management office , via their respective Twitter accounts , to refrain from viewing the flyover on the mall . 
The crowds appeared to be in greater number on the mall between the US Capitol and Washington Monument . 
CNN photojournalist Andrew Christman filmed the flyover on the mall near the Lincoln Memorial and reported a smaller crowd , with most people social distancing . 
Christman also traveled to the " Capitol side " of the mall after the flyover was completed and reported that the crowds were fewer and more spread out . 
CNN has reached out to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser â€™s office , the Air Force and White House for comments .
