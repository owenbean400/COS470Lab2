There is " no evidence " that hydroxychloroquine works for treating Covid 19 , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said on Thursday . 
During an interview on " Fox & Friends , " Birx was asked about the viral video that made several false claims about coronavirus , including that hydroxychloroquine , used in combination with zinc and Zithromax , is the cure for the virus . 
Birx said science and medicine have " always been full of accounts like this . 
And that 's why you do randomized clinical trials to actually be able to compare patient to patient . "
