The principles are : Looking back on the Southern states that have already experienced resurgences , Fauci said , there was an increase in the percent positive of tests being done , which is " surefire indication that you are in a process where you ’re heading towards a resurgence . " 
He said that they were starting to see that in some states now , such as Kentucky , Tennessee , Ohio and Indiana . 
Fauci added that he and other members of the White House coronavirus task force made the point on the weekly call with governors that " it is very important to get ahead of the curve , because what we are seeing now is what actually took place a couple of weeks ago . " " If you ’re not getting your arms around and suppressing that surge that ’s coming up , that ’s just a little bit below the radar screen , before you know it , two to three weeks down the pike , you ’re in trouble , " he added .
