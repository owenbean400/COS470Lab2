During an interview on Fox & Friends Thursday , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , called on state and local officials " to mandate masks for their communities " to slow the spread of Covid 19 . 
Birx explained that although the situation is improving across the South , there is " still a very serious pandemic " in that region . 
She added health officials now see the virus " moving up . " 
" Now we see the virus – probably because of vacations and other reasons of travel – moving up into Kentucky , Tennessee , southern Ohio , Missouri , Iowa , Kansas , Nebraska and , of course , we continue to have problems across the west coast – Washington , Oregon , California , Idaho and Utah – and now increases in Colorado ... these are the states that we call yellow states , " Birx said . 
These are the states requiring people to wear masks when out in public .
