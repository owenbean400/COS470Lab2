President Trump announced Sunday that he will compel a US company to make swabs under the Defense Production Act . 
Two people familiar with the decision told CNN that company is Puritan Medical Products , which is based in Maine . 
It is known for making " flocked swabs , " which it says are better at collecting specimens than other types . 
Trump said the administration had experienced " difficulty " with the company , but did not elaborate further . 
Puritan did not immediately respond to CNN 's request for comment . 
" We â€™ve had a little difficulty with one so we 'll call in -- as we have in the past as you know -- we are calling in the Defense Production Act and we 'll be getting swabs very easily , " Trump said .
