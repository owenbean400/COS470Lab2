US House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer says Democrats are finalizing their coronavirus package today and will hold a vote on it tomorrow . 
He said there wo not be time for a Congressional Budget Office score of the bill . 
He also could not provide reporters with a specific cost estimate , saying it will " probably be in the billions . " 
" It ’ll be much more costly if we do not provide this relief , " he said of the bill . 
Remember : The legislation is not expected to pass in the Senate , as talks between lawmakers and the Trump administration continue . 
Hoyer yesterday appeared to rule out the White House ’s proposed payroll tax cut from being included in future coronavirus response legislation , saying he thinks it is " a nonstarter . "
