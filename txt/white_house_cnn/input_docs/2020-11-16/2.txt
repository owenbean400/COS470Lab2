Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir said Monday that his agency has distributed more than 50 million point of care tests to keep schools and universities open and to protect the vulnerable in nursing homes . 
The Health and Human Services Department has distributed Abbott ’s Binax Now rapid antigen tests to nursing homes , home health care organizations , American Indian nations and historically Black colleges and universities . 
For this week , the agency has distributed more than 8 million Binax Now tests to these targeted populations . 
It has also sent additional tests to conduct large scale surveillance operations in Utah where there has been a spike in cases , and extra tests in the past 10 days to support school reopenings in southeastern Pennsylvania , Giroir said . 
Giroir added that he has sent a surge of tests to multiple locations in 10 states and will be extending the surge of tests to New Mexico and Kentucky for the next two weeks . 
The agency also sent extra tests to nursing homes in yellow zones — regions of the country with a high number of cases — in anticipation of the approval of the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibody treatments . 
" For this therapy to be most effective , it needs to be given early , " Giroir said . 
" So distributing Binax Now to all nursing homes means that they have a very sensitive way to immediately diagnosis symptomatic residents who might benefit from the Lilly monoclonal that ’s actually in the states as of today . "
