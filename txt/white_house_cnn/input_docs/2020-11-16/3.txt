Michigan announced 12,763 new Covid 19 cases between Sunday and Monday , with 55 new deaths in the same time period , bringing the state to 8,049 deaths since the pandemic began , according to the state ’s Covid 19 dashboard . 
Gov . 
Gretchen Whitmer shared her sorrow at passing the milestone in a release Monday afternoon . 
The state has 3,710 current hospitalizations of confirmed positive patients , with another 388 suspected positives , according to its Covid 19 dashboard . 
At least 749 people are in intensive care with suspected or confirmed Covid 19 cases and 343 patients are on ventilators . 
Whitmer also asked for a continued push toward a second stimulus package from Congress and the White House . 
She expressed optimism in vaccine trials from Moderna and Pfizer that have greater than 90 % effectiveness , but on the heels of her additional restrictions Sunday , Whitmer cautioned Michiganders to remain vigilant . 
" This is all good news , but it does not mean that we can let our guard down and loosen the safety measures we have made in our daily lives , " she said in the release . 
" It ’s crucial that we keep our infection rate low so we can save lives and distribute the vaccine as quickly as possible when it ’s ready . " 
One thing to note : These numbers were released by Michigan ’s public health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
