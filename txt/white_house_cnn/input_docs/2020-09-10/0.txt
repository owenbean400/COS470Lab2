People who may have relaxed social distancing precautions over Labor Day weekend should get tested for Covid 19 , White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said Thursday . 
Birx said that much of asymptomatic spread is happening between and within families and in settings like neighborhood parties . 
" Just because we know someone , we think that there 's no way that they could have Covid , but I want to tell you , you ca not tell , " Birx said . 
Birx urged those who socialized closely with others over Labor Day weekend , especially without a mask , to get tested .
