Israel recorded a new daily highest spike in coronavirus cases on Tuesday with 5,523 new diagnoses , according to Ministry of Health data -- an increase of more than 10 % on the previous high set just one day earlier . 
Cases are climbing throughout the country just two days before a second general lockdown is set to begin . 
The number of serious cases also rose to 535 on Tuesday , with 138 patients now on ventilators . 
US visit : The new daily high came on the day Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington , DC signing normalization agreements at the White House with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain . 
Netanyahu , who has repeatedly stressed the importance of wearing masks and social distancing , appeared to do neither at the White House , where administration officials did not require masks and many of the hundreds of attendees went without them . 
Schools close early : In light of the surging cases , Netanyahu announced that schools would close on Thursday , one day earlier than planned . 
The former director of public health at the Ministry of Health , who resigned her position after blaming the government for failing to heed the advice of health experts , said in her resignation letter that the reopening of schools was one of the key sources of spreading coronavirus infections throughout the country . 
Israel â€™s second general lockdown is scheduled to start Friday afternoon and last for a period of three weeks .
