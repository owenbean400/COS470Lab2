US President Donald Trump continued to claim that coronavirus will " go away , " claiming it might disappear without a vaccine , while speaking at an ABC town hall on Tuesday Trump also claimed " herd development " can help the disease dissipate , and some doctors , including Scott Atlas , have argued for that strategy . 
Herd immunity : When pressed about his claim that the virus might go away without a vaccine , Trump apparently argued for herd immunity , a strategy that has become controversial in recent weeks . 
Trump then said that Dr . Scott Atlas , a coronavirus adviser to the administration , said herd immunity could have been helpful from the beginning of the pandemic , though Atlas has claimed he has never advised the President for a herd immunity strategy . 
" You look at Scott Atlas , you look at some of the other doctors that are highly , from Stanford , look at some of the other doctors . 
They think maybe we could have done that from the beginning , " Trump said . 
Atlas ' comments : In an interview with the BBC earlier this month , Atlas said he had never recommended herd immunity as a strategy to fight the virus . 
" I have never , literally never , advised the President of the United States to pursue a strategy of herd immunity , of opening the doors and letting people get infected , " Atlas told the BBC . 
" I have never advised that , I have never advocated for that to the task force , I have never told anybody in the White House that that 's what we should be doing . "
