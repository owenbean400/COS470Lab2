Chicago and Detroit are demonstrating a concerning spread of coronavirus , Dr . Deborah Birx said at Thursday â€™s White House briefing . 
She said those locations were showing a " more rapid increase " of spread . 
Forty percent of the country has " extraordinarily low rates " of coronavirus , Birx said . 
And 55 % of all cases are in the New York and New Jersey area , she said . 
Birx also noted that 19 states currently have fewer than 200 cases , noting those states have been conducting tests , and that the low numbers are not because those states have not been testing . 
" There is no reality on the ground that 60-70 % of Americans will get infected in the next 8-12 weeks , " Birx said . 
Despite multiple daily reports of shortages of supplies like personal protective equipment and the growing need for ventilators at hospitals nationwide , Birx insisted that most areas will have access to hospital beds or ventilators if they need them .
