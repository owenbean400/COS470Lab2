New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy says the state has 4,400 positive tests and 62 deaths . 
The numbers are up because of community spread and because testing facilities are open , he said . 
" We are all in on stay at home , " the governor told local radio program Hot 97 Ebro in the Morning . 
" There is hope on the horizon we just do not know when that is , but hope for the best but prepare for the worst let ’s not be fooling each other right now , " he said . 
" This is a war . " 
On federal help , Murphy said " I need him , I need the Vice President , we need the federal government , we need the White House . " 
The White House team for the most part has been " good " to deal with , Murphy said . 
The White House helped approve standing up four field hospitals that the Army Corps and FEMA are setting up for the state , he added . 
He said the state is " desperately short " of Personal protective equipment noting the government has already given 2 installments " but we need a lot more . " 
With regards to Trump 's optimism about being able to slowly open up around April 12 , Murphy said , " I 'll be the happiest guy in New Jersey , maybe in America , if that ’s the case but I sadly think the data is suggesting to us we ’re not going to be there . " 
He said of the stimulus package " it ’s a big deal " adding but " it ’s not everything "
