The US Congress will receive a " small number " of Covid 19 vaccine doses , according to a letter from Capitol attending physician Brian Monahan . 
In the letter , to Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell and viewed by CNN , Monahan wrote that Congress , the Supreme Court and Executive Branch agencies will be " provided with a specific number of Covid 19 vaccine doses to meet long standing requirements for continuity of government operations . " 
" Those requirements are focused on essential operations and personnel , " he added . 
Monahan continued that the " small number " of doses provided " reflects a fraction of the first tranche of vaccines as it is distributed throughout the country . "
