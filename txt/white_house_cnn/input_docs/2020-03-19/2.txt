Days after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced that the Defense Department would use its labs to help conduct coronavirus testing for civilians , a top military medical official said that the military had not yet been asked to do that . 
Esper repeated this at the White House press conference on Wednesday . 
But on Thursday , Army Lt . 
Gen . Ronald Place , the director of the Defense Health Agency , said " at this time we are only testing DOD beneficiaries ... at present we have not been asked to add our laboratories to the myriad labs across the country that have that capability . " 
Place added " we are far from being overwhelmed in our laboratories and have the capability to do way more than that . " 
Some context : Earlier Thursday , the Pentagon said the Defense Department " currently has 15 labs with 40 test kits available " with a daily capacity of 9,096 tests/day . 
It said that 1,574 patients had been tested and that " an additional lab is being prepared at Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Services in Thailand . "
