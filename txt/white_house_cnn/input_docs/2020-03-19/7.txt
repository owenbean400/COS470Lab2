President Trump 's notes from Thursday 's coronavirus briefing show someone crossed out the word " Corona " in coronavirus and replaced it with the word " Chinese . " 
This picture captured by Washington Post Photographer Jabin Botsford , comes as Trump has stepped up his efforts to scapegoat China for the spread of the coronavirus . 
The change in tone from the White House comes as the number of cases in the US rises on a daily basis , and despite Trump initially praising China 's President Xi Jinping for his handling of the crisis . 
After consulting with medical experts and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization , CNN has determined that the term " Chinese virus " is both inaccurate and considered stigmatizing . 
Some background : CNN previously reported that a prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the US military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China â€” and it did not originate in the Chinese city of Wuhan . 
Parts of Chinese social media , and even the country 's government , appear to have launched a concerted campaign to question the origin of the novel coronavirus , which has infected more than 170,000 people globally as of Tuesday midday , according to CNN 's case tracker . 
The first reported cases of the virus were in Wuhan , and scenes from the city on lockdown shocked the world . 
The lockdown gave an early indication for how seriously global authorities would need to combat the fast spreading virus . 
" Viruses know no borders and they do not care about your ethnicity or the color of your skin or how much money you have in the bank , " said Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program . 
" It 's really important that we be careful in the language we use . "
