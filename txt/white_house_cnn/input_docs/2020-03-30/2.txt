Federal , state and local governments have the responsibility of ensuring that hospitals are receiving the supplies they need to respond to the US coronavirus crisis , Dr . Deborah Birx , White House coronavirus response coordinator , said Monday morning . 
She continued : " What 's really important here is to look at all aspects of the supply chain . 
What does each hospital have and how are they being supplied ? 
Are they being supplied by the private sector or are they relying on the pre movement of the stockpile that went into warehouses . " 
" The hospitals are too busy to define what they need , " she said .
