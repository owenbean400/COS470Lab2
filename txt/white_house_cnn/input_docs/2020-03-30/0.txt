When Birx was asked on NBC 's " Today " show what her message was to rural areas in the country , she said this : " If you wait for that , if the metros and rural areas do not take care now , by the time you see it , it has penetrated your community pretty significantly . 
And that 's what we 're concerned about . 
And that 's why you have to prepare , even though you think it 's not there , " Birx told NBC 's Savannah Guthrie .
