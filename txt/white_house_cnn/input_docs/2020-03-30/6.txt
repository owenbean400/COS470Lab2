President Donald Trump and members of his administration on Monday again mentioned two drugs that could potentially help combat the coronavirus . 
Over the weekend , large drugmakers announced that they were providing millions of doses of the drugs to the federal government , and the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency approval for the Trump administration ’s plan to send the drugs to hospitals across the country . 
The medicines , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , are anti malaria drugs that have been used off label at hospitals to treat coronavirus patients . 
Facts First : While public health officials are hopeful that the drugs will work against coronavirus , Trump 's tone has not matched the science , which is extremely limited and anecdotal at this early stage . 
Trump 's over the top optimism has been tamped down by the medical professionals on the White House task force handling the pandemic . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation ’s top public health official on infectious disease , said the proof is only anecdotal . 
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was similarly careful with his language on Monday , and referred to the drugs as " potential Covid 19 treatments . " 
Trump has repeatedly touted the drugs in recent weeks , even though there has not been any clinical trials in humans proving that they work for coronavirus . 
Earlier this month , Trump tweeted that the drugs " have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine . " 
CNN Health ’s Arman Azad wrote about this on Sunday . 
He said : " Thus far , there is little scientific evidence that chloroquine , or its closely related analogue hydroxychloroquine , are effective in treating Covid 19 … While there 's limited evidence on the efficacy of chloroquine , or hydroxychloroquine , the FDA said the drugs ’ benefits outweighed their risk .
