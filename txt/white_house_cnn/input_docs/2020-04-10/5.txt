US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams pulled out his asthma inhaler during today 's White House briefing to prove that even " if you look fit " you could be at risk of getting coronavirus . 
Adams was addressing data that shows coronavirus is disproportionately impacting people of color . 
He noted that people of color are not " biologically or genetically predisposed to get Covid 19 . " 
But that they " are socially predisposed to coronavirus exposure . " 
" It 's alarming , but it 's not surprising that people of color have a greater burden of chronic health conditions , " he said , noting that those conditions might include high blood pressure and asthma . 
" As a matter of fact , I 've been carrying around an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack , " he said as he pulled out the inhaler . 
" And I hope that showing you this inhaler shows little kids with asthma all across the country that they can grow up to be Surgeon General one day . "
