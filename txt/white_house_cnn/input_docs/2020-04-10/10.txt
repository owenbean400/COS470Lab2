President Trump suggested Friday during the White House briefing that insurance companies should pay out business interruption claims related to the coronavirus , even if coverage for a pandemic is not explicitly included in their policy . 
Trump added : " You have people that have never asked for business interruption insurance ( payouts ) and they ’ve been paying a lot of money for a lot of years for the privilege of having it . 
And then when they finally need it , the insurance company says ‘ we ’re not going to give it . ’ 
We ca not let that happen . " 
The President also said that his administration has already suggested to credit card companies that they should reduce their fees .
