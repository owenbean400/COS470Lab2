Top infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci says antibody tests , which show who has already been infected with the coronavirus , will be available soon . 
Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases , said testing of people who currently have the coronavirus and antibody tests will be done in parallel . 
Fauci also said the prospect of Americans carrying certificates of immunity to prove they have tested positive for the antibodies to the coronavirus might " have some merit under certain circumstances . " 
Immunity certificates are being discussed in the White House coronavirus task force meetings , Fauci said . 
" It 's one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not . " 
Fauci declined to give a concrete date when the US can reopen businesses and begin to relax restrictions . 
" The virus kind of decides whether or not it 's going to be appropriate to open or not , " he said . 
" I would want to see a clear indication that you are very , very clearly and strongly going in the right direction . 
Because the one thing you do not want to do is you do not want to get out there prematurely and wind up back in the same situation , " he added . 
Fauci said that Americans should still practice social distancing guidelines during Passover and Easter . 
He predicted there will be many deaths in the next week , but " deaths tend to lag behind what the driving elements of the outbreak are , " and there should be fewer hospitalizations and intubations .
