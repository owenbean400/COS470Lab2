The effectiveness of homemade masks is " not possible to assess " at this time , said the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine in a letter to the White House on Wednesday . 
The National Academies offered guidance about the country ’s recommendation that people wear homemade masks to protect from the spread of coronavirus when an individual is asymptomatic or pre symptomatic . 
How well masks work depend on how they are made , the quality of production , and on how well the person follows other precautionary behaviors , said the letter . 
How coronavirus spreads : Researchers believe Covid 19 primarily spreads via large droplets , such as when someone coughs or sneezes . 
But it is also believed to spread via invisible droplets , as small as 5 microns – and even smaller bioaerosol particles – that can be expelled when an infected person breathes . 
How much these tiny particles can spread the disease is unknown , the letter says . 
Studies on the effectiveness of homemade masks are limited : One unpublished study showed that thicker masks worked better , but one mask that was tested was so thick it would " cause great discomfort " and may cause the wearer to pass out . 
There were no studies on how well homemade masks fit , the letter said . 
An ill fitting mask may leak . 
And if a person sweats , the moisture could trap the virus and become a potential contamination source . 
Another experiment looking at masks made from sweatshirts , t shirts , towels , scarves and cloth masks found that they reduced some low level protection against nanoparticles from someone breathing , but not from aerosolized infection .
