US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams on Wednesday tweeted that a herd immunity approach to combat coronavirus could lead to many deaths and " there is no example " of herd immunity as a successful strategy against Covid 19 . 
" So far , there is no example of a large scale successful intentional infection based herd immunity strategy , " Adams wrote , adding that the best way to stay safe , reduce the spread of infection and keep the country open was to wear masks , wash hands and watch distances . 
The topic has recently gained traction in the US and White House senior administration officials last week discussed a controversial declaration from a group of scientists during a call with reporters . 
The Great Barrington Declaration advocates for ending lockdowns , building immunity and pushing for those who are not vulnerable to Covid 19 to resume normal life . 
A senior administration official said it aligned " very strongly with what the President has said for months -- that is strongly protect the high risk elderly and vulnerable and open schools and restore society to function . "
