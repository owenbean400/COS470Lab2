US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams revealed in an interview that some of his family members and friends have been ill with Covid 19 – and that his wife had a delayed cancer diagnosis due to the pandemic . 
" I think about family members and friends of mine personally who have had the virus . 
And fortunately for me , none of them have succumbed . 
But I think that reflects a very real difference in outcomes if they have gotten it in March or April versus getting it now – with remdesivir , with steroids , " Adams told News Nation 's Marni Hughes in an interview posted online on Wednesday , referring to Covid 19 treatment approaches . 
" I think about my wife , who had a cancer diagnosis delayed , and who ’s undergoing cancer treatment right now . 
I hope she does well , but again , there are real negative , negative outcomes for people who are living through this pandemic , apart from the actual virus itself , " Adams said . 
Meanwhile , US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said his father died during the coronavirus pandemic — and he was not able to say goodbye . 
According to News Nation , the interview – which also included White House Coronavirus task force member Dr . Deborah Birx – is the first time these top health three health leaders fighting the coronavirus pandemic have sat down for an interview together .
