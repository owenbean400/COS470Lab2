Twitter on Sunday took down a tweet containing a false claim about coronavirus death statistics that was made by a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory -- a post that US President Donald Trump had retweeted earlier in the day . 
The tweet -- which has been replaced with a message saying , " This Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules -- from " Mel Q , " copied from someone else 's Facebook post , claimed that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had " quietly " updated its numbers " to admit that only 6 % " of people listed as coronavirus deaths " actually died from Covid , " since " the other 94 % had 2-3 other serious illnesses .

That 's not what the CDC said . 
As of Sunday at 4 p.m . ET , Twitter had not removed a second tweet , also retweeted by the President on Sunday , that spread the same false claim .

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Trump 's retweets .
