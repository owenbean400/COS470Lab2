The only way to find those with asymptomatic infections of Covid 19 at universities is to do aggressive testing , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force coordinator , said over the weekend . 
Birx said what she sees happening at schools " really gives us hope " that the universities will be able to find asymptomatic patients . 
Most university students wo not know that they â€™re infected , Birx said during a news briefing in Fargo , North Dakota , on Saturday . 
Birx also said she hoped universities could use surge testing , adding that testing could be sped up through innovative methods like pool testing and new collection techniques such as using saliva instead of nasal swabs . 
" That is all going to move forward here , " she said .
