University students who get infected with coronavirus should isolate where they are and not carry the virus away from campus , Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force coordinator , said over the weekend . 
Numerous coronavirus outbreaks have been detected as university and college students returned to campuses across the country to start the fall semester . 
" We can prevent the spread from any university into the community and into the homes from where the students came if the students will isolate and ensure they do not spread the virus , " Birx said .
