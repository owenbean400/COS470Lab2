" It ’s a personal decision , " she said . 
" I ’m tested regularly . 
I feel that it ’s safe for me not to be wearing a mask . " 
Asked earlier in the briefing whether anyone in the White House had any reservations about proceeding with the rally despite a recent spike in coronavirus cases in Oklahoma , Mc Enany said no one was concerned . 
" We are all on board for going to Oklahoma , " she said . 
Masks will be provided for attendees at the rally , but people will not be required to wear them .
