The White House said the demise of public coronavirus task force briefings is due to establishing a " regular routine " after the height of the pandemic . 
Press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany said Friday the task force still " meets regularly " and is " constantly reviewing data . " 
She said the public briefings only came during the " very early days of Covid and the pandemic , " though those briefings transpired daily for more than a month . 
She said that " now we 're in a more regular routine , " the briefings are no longer necessary . 
" We do not have regular updates for you other than for the updates I give you as news merits and I â€™m regularly in consultation with Dr . ( Deborah ) Birx and the others , " Mc Enany said .
