It 's E 7 to the Covid election . 
There are staggering numbers to report on both American voters and American Covid patients as the country hurtles toward an election and into a Covid surge . 
Covid infections , 7 day average : 68,767 .

In El Paso , they 're moving Covid patients to a children 's hospital after calling for additional refrigeration at morgues .

That 's either a lie or ignorance .

We 'll see .
