Coronavirus cases are truly up across the US and it ’s not just because of more testing Admiral Brett Giroir , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said Tuesday – directly contradicting President Trump . 
In March and April , probably only one out of 10 or 15 cases were being detected , he said . 
Today ca not really be compared to that time period , " but compared to the post Memorial Day surge , even though testing is up , this is a real increase in cases , " he said . 
Giroir said case numbers are up and also hospitalizations are also going up . 
He said hospitals are filling up and coming under stress in some parts of the country , but the number of people in the hospital with coronavirus is still lower than it was in July . 
One good thing is that a lot more young people are getting the virus compared to older people , which is one reason why hospitalizations are shorter , Giroir said . 
Also , there are some effective therapies .
