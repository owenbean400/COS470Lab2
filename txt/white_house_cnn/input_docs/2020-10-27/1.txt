World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said giving up on control of the coronavirus is dangerous and called for an end to the politicization of Covid 19 at a news briefing in Geneva on Monday . 
" Science continues to tell us the truth about this virus , how to contain it , suppress it and stop it from returning and how to save lives among those it reaches , " Tedros said . 
Many countries and cities have followed the science , he said , and been able to suppress the virus and minimize deaths . 
" Quick and deliberate leadership helps to suppress it , " he said . 
On Sunday , White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN the US is " not going to control " the coronavirus pandemic . 
" We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines , therapeutics and other mitigation areas , " Meadows told CNN 's Jake Tapper on " State of the Union . " 
Tedros said countries can do both and pointed out that many European nations have done so . 
" We should not give up and that ’s why we are saying -- although we agree with the Chief of Staff that ... protecting the vulnerable is important , " Tedros said . 
" But giving up on control is dangerous and control should also be part of the strategy , " Tedros added . 
Governments and citizens should both do their share , otherwise " this virus is dangerous . 
If it ’s let go freely , it can create havoc , " he said . 
This is especially the case when there is not a vaccine or therapeutics at hand , Tedros said .
