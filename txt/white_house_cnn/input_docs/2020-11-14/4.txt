New York 's Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo responded to President Trump 's threat to delay delivery of a potential vaccine to the Empire State , flatly calling the President 's remarks today " untrue . " 
" Luckily he wo not be here , " when the vaccine arrives , said Cuomo of Trump . 
Speaking at the White House today , Trump slammed Cuomo for planning a state review process of any vaccine , telling reporters Cuomo " will have to let us know when he â€™s ready for it because otherwise , we ca not be delivering it to a state that wo not be giving it to its people immediately . " 
Speaking with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer today , Trump defended the statewide approval process saying the goal was to raise trust in the medicine among New Yorkers . 
" We are in a situation now where half the people in the country are saying ' I do not know if I should trust the vaccine , ' " said Cuomo . 
" . . . If we have a vaccine that people do not trust it wo not accomplish anything anyway . " 
New York 's review would be conducted simultaneous to the federal government 's approval process , according to Cuomo . 
There would only be a delay if the approval team , which will be lead by a Nobel Prize laureate found the medicine lacking .
