Coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics have been developed without political interference , Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , said Friday at a White House briefing . 
Slaoui touted the progress of several vaccines and therapeutics , including Pfizer ’s and Moderna ’s vaccines , which he said expect to file for emergency use authorization within the next few weeks . 
" It is important to note that this progress has been achieved without any political interference -- I said it many times -- and at every step has been and is being judged by independent expert bodies , " Slaoui said . 
He mentioned Data and Safety Monitoring Boards , independent groups that monitor vaccine trials . 
" It 's not the companies ; it 's not Operation Warp Speed ; it 's not the US government , " Slaoui said . 
" It is independent experts that assess the safety and the efficacy of the vaccines that are being tested . "
