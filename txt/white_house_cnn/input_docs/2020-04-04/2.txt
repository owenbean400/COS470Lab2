President Donald Trump continued to claim hydroxychloroquine has high efficacy against Covid 19 , stating lupus patients – who are commonly treated with hydroxychloroquine – are less likely to contract the virus on Saturday at a White House press briefing . 
However , there is no " definitive information to be able to make any comment , " said Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , at the briefing . 
The relationship between lupus and Covid 19 is currently being studied in " a natural history study , " Fauci said . 
Trump later stated he would take the medication , likely as a preventative measure , given his negative Covid 19 testing . 
" But I think people should [ take hydroxychloroquine ] , " he said . 
" If it were me , in fact , I might do it anyway . 
I may take it … I have to ask my doctors about that . 
But I may take it . " 
There are currently no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent Covid 19 .
