Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is calling for the president to invoke the full Defense Production Act as states struggle with medical supply shortages . 
Schumer said he talked to President Trump and other White House officials and asked them to seriously consider allowing the military to take over factories and supply chains . 
" We 're in a wartime here , and we need this military leader , command and control with the president 's full backing , and that will make this horrible , horrible scourge end more quickly with fewer illnesses and fewer deaths , " Schumer said .
