Adm . Brett Giroir , the White House ’s coronavirus testing czar , responded on Sunday to a question from CNN about whether it would be a mistake for the Biden team to change the vaccine distribution plan . 
CNN 's Dana Bash quoted Giroir ’s message to the Biden administration team from earlier in the week as " you need to let it work . " 
Giroir also gave the reminder that almost everyone on Operation Warp Speed , " who ’s actually delivering the vaccine and controlling the logistics , they ’ll be there on January 19 , they ’ll be there on January 21 . " 
" So , I believe there ’ll be a smooth , professional transition , " he said . 
He said to remember that they ’re starting with about 40 million doses of vaccine , already this year there have been 180 million flu vaccines distributed . 
" Now the logistics are more difficult and the cold chain is more difficult , but I really am confident in the plan to get it , and particularly get it to the states and get it to the high risk populations , " he said . 
On testing , Giroir said that the US is doing more than enough . 
" We ’re doing everything we can possibly do on testing , " he told CNN . 
" We have our first home based test , it 's only available about 100,000 per month , but we 're going to continue to invest , knock down every door to get the technologies and to scale up , " he said . 
" We would ultimately like to get to a point in time where we do a lot more asymptomatic testing . "
