Adm . Brett Giroir , the White House 's coronavirus testing czar , said today if you ’ve done any traveling over the holidays , you should get tested . 
" Just remember you 've had an increased risk of being exposed , so you should decrease unnecessary activities for about a week , and if you can get tested in three or five days that 's also a very good idea , " Giroir told CNN on Sunday . 
Giroir said he is concerned about a possible surge in cases and hospitalizations as travel increases . 
" Our hospitalizations are peaking right now at about 95,000 , " he said . 
" About 20 % of all people in the hospital have Covid , so this is a really dangerous time . " 
Unless you ’ve come into contact with someone for longer than 15 minutes who has tested positive for Covid 19 , it is not recommended that you quarantine after gathering for Thanksgiving , according to Giroir . 
" That 's not recommended to have a quarantine after travel unless you 've had a direct exposure to a person with Covid for 15 minutes in close contact , " he said . 
" Make really sure you adhere 100 % to mask wearing to avoid crowds because you could inadvertently have gotten Covid and spread it , so just be careful during the week after your travel because you are at increased risk , " Giroir said .
