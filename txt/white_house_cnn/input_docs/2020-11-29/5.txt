Birx said that the one thing that will be bought to the Biden team in that discussion is to understand how they want to see the data . 
" Data is not helpful is it ’s not actionable , and each group needs to see it the way it makes them , moves to action , " she said . 
" That ’s why we write the governors report weekly to really ensure every governor understand what we ’re seeing and what we think needs to be done . "
