Sunlight and bleach can both kill the novel coronavirus , a federal official told the daily White House briefing on Thursday . 
But US President Donald Trump turned what should have been a simple scientific summary into a puzzling stream of dangerous ideas about somehow streaming light into the body and suggestions about injecting disinfectants . 
Here 's what was said : Bill Bryan , a senior official at the US Department of Homeland Security , said studies on the virus showed bleach kills coronavirus in about five minutes , and isopropyl alcohol destroys it even faster . 
He also said the virus dies quickest under direct sunlight , and that temperature and humidity affect how long the virus survives . 
This was Trump 's take : It was not immediately clear how Trump would propose bringing light into the body . 
Scientists were horrified by his claims . 
Multiple experts warned after Trump 's briefing that nobody should ingest disinfectant , and that it simply does not work . 
The World Health Organization says on its website that exposing yourself to the sun or high temperatures does not prevent Covid 19 , and warns specifically against using ultraviolet lamps , including tanning lamps , to try to kill virus . 
" UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation , " the WHO cautions . 
Too much UV light damage can lead to skin cancer . 
And chlorine bleach is toxic : it can and does kill people who drink it . 
The US Food and Drug Administration regularly warns the public against drinking bleach , or even inhaling fumes from bleach . 
It 's also irritating to skin .
