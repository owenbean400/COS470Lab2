Dr . Stephen Hahn , the Food and Drug Administration commissioner and a member of the White House coronavirus task force , spoke tonight at CNN 's ongoing town hall about research into treatments for the virus . 
The FDA has authorized 62 clinical trials in the United States , and there are another 211 trials in the planning process , he said . 
Trials that began months ago are well underway , with initial results expected as soon as a month from now . 
He added that the FDA relies on results of randomized clinical trials , but did take into consideration results from observational studies , which are particularly important for physicians making decisions for their patients .
