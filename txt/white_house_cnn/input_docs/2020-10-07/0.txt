The White House coronavirus outbreak could have been prevented and is proof the pandemic is not a hoax , said Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , on Tuesday . 
" Take a look at what happened this week at the White House . 
That is a reality right there . 
And every day that goes by more people are popping up that are infected , " Fauci said in a conversation with students and families at American University . 
When asked by a student how to handle family members and others who do not believe the pandemic is real , Fauci suggested appealing to rationality and statistics . 
" Right now we have 210,000 people who have died and 7.3 million people ( who ) have been infected . 
Globally , there are over 1 million people who have died . 
That is not a hoax , " Fauci said . 
" You ca not say that people all over the world and American allies are all lying and calling it a hoax . " 
" It â€™s reality . "
