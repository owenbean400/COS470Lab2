And in a fresh assault on public health strategies needed to quell a now accelerating pandemic , Trump claimed falsely that it was no worse than the flu , as he portrays himself as a hero leader who conquered the virus . 
By reinforcing his denial of a national emergency that has killed more than 210,000 Americans , Trump is adopting a high risk strategy that potentially offends bereaved relatives of those who died from the disease and almost everyone else who has seen their lives , schooling and family life shattered . 
By squelching economic rescue talks , he leaves himself open to charges of indifference to the plight of millions of Americans thrown out of work during the pandemic and who relied on now expired federal unemployment benefits .
