White House communications director Alyssa Farah downplayed a press release from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released Tuesday that declared " ENDING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC " as a key administration accomplishment , saying Wednesday that it was " poorly worded . " 
" No absolutely not , I think that was poorly worded , " Farah said during an appearance on Fox News Wednesday morning when asked whether the President believes the pandemic has ended . 
Farah downplayed and defended it further when pressed by CNN ’s Joe Johns during a one man gaggle . 
" We 're certainly not getting ahead of it , we 're still in the midst of the pandemic . 
We do say we 're turning the corner and what we mean by that is , we 're rushing therapeutics , we ’re in the best place to treat the virus that we 've ever been in . 
And by end of year we expect that we 'll have the vaccine , at which point we will defeat the virus , " she said . 
She continued : " But I think the intention of that press release was to give credit to the career medical professionals and scientists has been working since day one on this pandemic . " 
And asked by Joe Johns about reports of thousands of Nebraska supporters stranded in the cold after last night ’s Omaha rally , Farah directed questions to the campaign , but said , " The health and safety of those coming out to support the President is our top priority . " 
On Fox , she said that rising cases and hospitalizations are " absolutely " a concern but said the administration is " working with every county and state to monitor hospital capacity , " going on to attack Joe Biden ’s plans to deal with the pandemic . 
" We are ready to deal with cases as they arise . 
We will not have hospitals overflowing , and if there is a need to surge medical capacity or even military doctors , we ’ve done that , we have the muscle memory , and we ’ll be prepared to do it , but as I said , we have a vaccine coming soon , " she said .
