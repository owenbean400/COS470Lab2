A GOP official discussed President Trump 's recent behavior and suggestions that he may veto the recently passed compromise spending bill and Covid 19 funding measures . 
" The Trump tantrum has nothing to do with check size or spending—he was fully aware of the the negotiations carried out in his behalf by Meadows and Mnuchin and never said peep , " the official said . 
They continued : What this is about : President Trump 's surprise Tuesday night video cataloging his complaints about the massive — and painstakingly negotiated — $ 900 billion coronavirus relief bill immediately raised the specter of a government shutdown and economic turmoil at a time when aid is desperately sought for millions of Americans . 
The President did not explicitly threaten to veto the bill , and his White House said earlier in the night that he would sign it , but in a video released on Twitter , he added a layer of confusion to a delicate process that includes not only Covid 19 relief but a $ 1.4 trillion omnibus spending package that funds the federal government .
