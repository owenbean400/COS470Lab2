Israel smashed its daily coronavirus record with 4,973 cases diagnosed on Monday , according to the Ministry of Health , surging past the previous record of 4,217 set last week . 
Israel is also seeing new highs in the number of severe cases with 533 serious cases and 140 patients on ventilators . 
The new record comes three days before Israel is set to enter a second general lockdown to bring the numbers under control , making it perhaps the first country in the world to reimpose a general lockdown . 
Although not as strict as the first lockdown in April , the new restrictions , scheduled to last three weeks through the Jewish high holidays , will see the closure of schools , restaurants ( except delivery ) , entertainment venues and more . 
Gatherings will be limited to 20 people outdoors and 10 people indoors . 
The record also comes with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington DC for a signing ceremony of normalization agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain . 
The ceremony itself has sparked concerns over the spread of coronavirus , since the White House is expecting a crowd of hundreds of people and is not requiring the wearing of masks , which is obligatory in Israel .
