Dr . Anthony Fauci said a national mask mandate " probably would not work . " 
Speaking during a news conference with Vermont Gov . 
Phil Scott , Fauci said , " There is such a degree of variability of accepting mandates throughout the country . " 
Fauci added this has been discussed " in great detail at the level of the White House coronavirus task force . " 
" If the citizens of a particular state , a city , a county or what have you , are really in lockstep with the authority , that does it – there ’s not a big problem , " he said . 
However , issues arise when a majority of the population in an area do not agree with the mandate – and that begs the question : How do you enforce the mandate ? 
Fauci said anything that puts an " authoritative statement to the citizenry often is met with a considerable amount of pushback . "
