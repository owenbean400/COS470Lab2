Bill Gates , founder of Microsoft and co chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , called the US response to Covid 19 " shocking " and " mismanaged " in an interview published on Monday in Stat . 
" You know , this has been a mismanaged situation every step of the way , " Gates told Stat . 
" It ’s shocking . 
It ’s unbelievable – the fact that we would be among the worst in the world . " 
Gates said the change to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Covid 19 testing guidelines for people without symptoms " blows the mind . " 
He criticized US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn and his mischaracterization of findings arounds convalescent plasma . 
Hahn has acknowledged the misstatement and said criticism of his remarks was " entirely justified . " 
Gates also mentioned Dr . Scott Atlas , a neuroradiologist and senior fellow at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution who is now a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force . 
CNN has reported that Atlas has advocated herd immunity through mass infection in briefings and written pieces in recent months ; 
Atlas has denied pushing a herd immunity strategy in the White House . 
" The administrations now hired this Stanford guy who has no background at all just because he agrees with their crackpot theories , " Gates said .
