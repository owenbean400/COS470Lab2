White House officials have been eyeing " pool testing " as a way to increase testing for the coronavirus in the United States -- and US Food and Administration commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn on Thursday called the approach a " significant strategy . " 
" It is one strategy and a significant strategy to increase our testing capacity , " Hahn told ABC 's Whit Johnson during an appearance on Good Morning America . 
To conduct pool testing , " you take multiple samples and run them as one test . 
It saves on test supplies , reagents , et cetera , " Hahn said . 
" Laboratories have to do this under special conditions . " 
FDA published guidance for laboratories last month on how to conduct pool testing . 
The guidance laid out guideposts for making tests that could be used for widespread screening of people showing no symptoms -- as opposed to person by person testing by a provider . 
The FDA also laid out steps for making and using tests for pooling samples .
