National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Friday that the White House is considering small " timely and targeted micro forms of assistance " for Americans impacted by the novel coronavirus . 
Kudlow did not offer many more details , saying he â€™d give " more details later . " 
Kudlow also said the administration has been looking into " operations that would provide immediate cash assistance " through a variety of federal agencies . 
Talking about the dip in the market due to the coronavirus , Kudlow said the administration was considering those " micro forms of assistance " because " we think we will get out of this , within months . "
