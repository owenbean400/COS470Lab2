If there ’s one thing he regrets about the pandemic , the US ' top infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci says he wishes he had pushed harder for broader testing early on . 
Fauci , who was an early member of the White House coronavirus task force , said he knew the pandemic would be bad when it was clear community spread was happening back in the late winter . 
Importance of testing : Testing is the first step for contact tracing -- a tried and true public health approach that involves identifying cases quickly , isolating and treating those people , identifying their contacts and testing them to see if they need to be isolated or quarantined . 
" But deep down perhaps I should have been much more vocal about saying we have really , absolutely , got to do that , ’ " Fauci said . 
" I saw that it went nowhere and maybe I should have kept pushing the envelope on that . " 
Testing is important because otherwise cases spread silently , Fauci noted . 
" What is going on now that you do not recognize becomes a case a few weeks later , " he said . 
" That becomes a hospitalization a few weeks later . 
That becomes intensive care a few days later . 
That becomes death a few weeks later . " 
Fauci said he was hesitant to talk about his regrets for fear his statements would be taken out of context as sound bites .
