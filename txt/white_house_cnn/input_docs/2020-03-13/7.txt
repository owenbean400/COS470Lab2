President Trump on Friday said that the threat of novel coronavirus to young , healthy Americans " remains very low , " but warned that " anyone can be a carrier " of the virus . 
The remarks came as he has not been tested for coronavirus despite extended contact with someone who has been diagnosed . 
" While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low — read a lot about this in the last two weeks — anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions , and those who are most at risk , they have not done very well , " Trump said in the Rose Garden . 
He continued : " Older Americans , who are — especially if they have a health problem — have not done well . 
We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take . " 
Trump has previously said " the risk to the American people remains very low " — today , he added the " young " and " healthy " caveats . 
The White House has said repeatedly that the President is asymptomatic and will not be tested , however , as CNN has reported , officials are now weighing whether Trump , who is in the age group of those who are more likely to get seriously ill if infected , should be tested . 
Other politicians who have had similar types of contact with those who have tested positive for the virus have self quarantined out of an abundance of caution .
