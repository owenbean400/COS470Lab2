Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell reiterated the need for a bipartisan stimulus package before the end of the year , emphasizing that it must receive the President 's signature to offer effective relief amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
Mc Connell said on Wednesday " we 're seeing cracks starting to form in the Democratic leader 's stone wall , " referencing the Senate Democrats who joined with some of their Republican colleagues to put forth a bipartisan stimulus proposal aimed at breaking through the long stalled negotiations . 
But , as he did yesterday , Mc Connell made it clear that his support is firmly behind the White House backed plan that he 's been drafting with input from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows . 
" I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally let Congress pass a bipartisan bill that the President will actually sign into law and do so soon , " he said , noting that his proposal includes popular measures like a new round of Paycheck Protection Program and an extension of emergency federal unemployment benefits that are due to expire at the end of the year . 
Some context : Moments before Mc Connell 's speech on the Senate floor , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that President Trump would sign the bill Mc Connell is spearheading .
