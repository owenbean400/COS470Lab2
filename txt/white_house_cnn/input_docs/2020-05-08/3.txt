As many as 75,000 Americans could die because of drug or alcohol misuse and suicide as a result of the coronavirus pandemic , according to an analysis conducted by the national public health group Well Being Trust . 
The growing unemployment crisis , economic downturns and stress caused by isolation and lack of a definitive end date for the pandemic could significantly increase so called " deaths of despair " unless local , state and federal authorities take action , the group says in a new report released Friday . 
The Well Being trust released maps showing state and county level projections of these types of deaths , based on data from past years , due to Covid 19 ’s impact on unemployment , isolation and uncertainty . 
The group is calling for a robust approach from local , state and federal officials and agencies to help those who lose their jobs because of the pandemic to find work . 
What happened in 2008 : Deaths from both suicide and drug overdoses rose along with unemployment during the 2008 recession . 
Unemployment went from 4.6 % in 2007 to a peak of 10 % in October 2009 and declined steadily , reaching 3.5 % in early 2010 , according to the group . 2020 could be much worse . 
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Tuesday he expects the US unemployment rate was above 16 % in April , " My guess right now is it ’s going to be north of 16 % , maybe as high as 20 % , " he said . 
" We 're looking at probably the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression , " Hassett told CNN 's Poppy Harlow Tuesday .
