Dr . Deborah Birx , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said on CNN 's global town hall that the Trump administration was still in the editing process regarding a draft recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to reopen the United States after the coronavirus pandemic . 
A senior CDC official told CNN Thursday that the Trump administration would not implement the 17 page recommendation . 
" We are used to dealing with a White House that asks for things and then chaos ensues . 
A team of people at the CDC spent innumerable hours in response to an ask from Debbie Birx , " the official said . 
Birx said that the decision was made not to implement the recommendation because the editing process had not been completed . 
Birx said that they were also devoting special attention to " surveillance for asymptomatic individuals . " 
" That was a very new element that we really felt very strongly had to be included because of the ever increasing evidence of asymptomatic spread , " she said .
