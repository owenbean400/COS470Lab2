Seven former commissioners of the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) joined forces Tuesday to condemn increasing White House pressure on the agency they once headed . 
The administration pressure is eroding the faith Americans have in an agency set up to protect them from bad drugs , contaminated food and other dangers , Drs . 
Robert Califf , Scott Gottlieb , Margaret Hamburg , Jane Henney , David Kessler , Mark Mc Clellan and Andy von Eschenbach wrote in a commentary in the Washington Post . 
The former commissioners , who have served under both Democratic and Republican administrations , said the actions were undermining 114 years of work the FDA has done to build trust . 
If people doubt the safety of any coronavirus vaccine , they wo not get immunized , the seven argued . 
Kessler now advises the Biden campaign . 
Gottlieb , who was FDA commissioner under Trump until last year , is on the board of Pfizer , which is working on a Covid 19 vaccine and Mc Clellan , who served under George W . Bush , is on the board of Johnson & Johnson , also developing a coronavirus vaccine .
