Google will not be publishing a national scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon , contrary to claims made by President Trump during a Friday news conference . 
Instead , a health focused subsidiary owned by Google 's parent company , Alphabet , intends to launch a small scale website next week to begin to triage California based patients . 
The website will aim to serve a broader population only " over time " â€” not " very quickly , " as Trump said . 
Wang added : " Our aspiration is for the triage tool to be used much more broadly over time . 
Initially , we 're linking it with several sites in the Bay Area to test and iterate , and collaborating closely with organizations like Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp who are also working on additional approaches to making testing more accessible and expedient in other areas . " 
Officials in the state of California were stunned Friday to see the White House present a graphic for a modest pilot program that California 's been developing with Alphabet as if it were a Trump administration program that was a nationwide initiative and ready to go , according to a knowledgeable source . 
Still , a White House official , in reaction to Google 's response , doubled down Saturday , telling CNN that " the Trump administration is working with Google to develop a website Americans can go to determine whether a test is needed and , if so , facilitate testing at a nearby location . 
We expect to have more details in the days ahead . " 
Some context : Verily 's statement sharply contrasts with Trump 's remarks Friday in the White House Rose Garden when the President said Google " is helping to develop a website . 
It 's going to be very quickly done , unlike websites of the past , to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location . "
