Two more members of a Brazilian delegation that traveled to the US , including one man who attended a dinner with President Donald Trump , have tested positive for the coronavirus . 
The first is Nestor Forster , Brazil ’s Chargé d 'Affaires in Washington . 
The Brazilian Embassy in Washington announced on Twitter that Forster had tested positive . 
He will now be self quarantined for two weeks . 
He was seated at the same table as Trump last Saturday during the dinner at Mar a Lago , a source familiar with the incident told CNN . 
The source could not say if there was any direct interaction between Forster and Trump . 
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment . 
A group photo tweeted on March 8 by Brazil ’s foreign minister shows Forster standing behind Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro , a short distance from Trump . 
The second is Brazilian Senator Nelsinho Trad . 
Trad announced on Twitter late Friday that he tested positive . 
That makes three infections : The first in the delegation to test positive was Bolsonaro ’s press secretary , Fábio Wajngarten , who confirmed his result on Thursday . 
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez , who shook hands with Forster during the trip , also tested positive on Friday . 
And Bolsonaro 's attorney , Karina Kufa , wrote on her unverified Twitter account Friday that she tested positive after visiting Miami on the same trip . 
President Bolsonaro on Friday said his results came back negative after the trip .
