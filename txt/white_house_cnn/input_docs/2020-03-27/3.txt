President Trump said Friday that he may not invoke the Defense Production Act after saying earlier today that he had activated it to order General Motors to make ventilators . 
Trump said during a White House coronavirus press briefing that he believed a deal had been reached between GM and the federal government to produce the ventilators , but the deal had fallen through . 
He says he decided to use the powers in the DPA to order GM to produce the needed medical equipment saying , " This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we 'll not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis . "
