Congress just passed a $ 2 trillion stimulus bill to address the growing economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic . 
Included are direct payments to many Americans . 
Individuals are eligible for up to $ 1,200 and couples would receive up to $ 2,400 — plus $ 500 per child . 
But the payments would start phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $ 75,000 . 
The amount would then be reduced by $ 5 for every additional $ 100 of adjusted gross income , and those making more than $ 99,000 would not receive anything . 
The income thresholds are doubled for married couples . 
Income would generally be based on one 's 2019 or 2018 tax returns . 
The money will likely be deposited directly into individuals ' bank accounts — as long as they 've already authorized the IRS to send their tax refund that way over the past two years . 
If not , the IRS would send out checks in the mail . 
The White House has said they hope to begin distributing cash quickly , but it may take weeks before the bulk of payments go out .
