Dr . Deborah Birx , coordinator of the White House coronavirus response , said on Tuesday that she plans to retire , but she 's willing to help President elect Joe Biden 's team as needed . 
In a tweet shared by reporter Amber Strong from the news site Newsy , Birx said she would serve as a resource to the Biden administration as needed . 
" I will be helpful in any role that people think I can be helpful in , and then I will retire . 
I will have to say as a civil servant , I will be helpful through a period of time , " she said . 
Additionally , Birx said that she wants the " Biden administration to be successful . " 
Her comments come days after The Associated Press reported that she traveled out of state for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend , even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many health officials warned the American public to not travel or attend any gatherings if possible .
