Prominent coronavirus modeler Dr . Christopher Murray says US President Donald Trump was wrong when he said Murray 's latest forecast about the number of virus deaths did not account for mitigation measures . 
The model , often cited by the White House , now forecasts more than 134,000 people will die from Covid 19 by August -- double its earlier projection . 
Trump , when asked by CNN about the new model from Murray ’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) , claimed that the model " assumes no mitigation . " 
Murray confirmed that ’s incorrect . 
Murray , chair of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington , said there are some positive factors that have also influenced the model . 
An increase in testing and contact tracing will help reduce the number of deaths , he predicts . 
Summer temperatures should also " put a little bit of a brake on transmission , " Murray said . 
" So all those are factored into our forecast of 134,000 deaths , " Murray said . 
Murray said use of masks , avoiding large gatherings and working from home will help reduce the spread of the virus .
