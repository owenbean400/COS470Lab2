The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidance in late summer to focus on testing symptomatic people , which " put a pale on testing for a number of weeks , " White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx says Some background : On Aug . 24 , the CDC website said : " If you have been in close contact ( within 6 feet ) of a person with a COVID 19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms , you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one . " 
However , on in September , it updated its guidelines to stress that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested for coronavirus . 
Birx has been a proponent of testing and says she believes " testing alone is a public health intervention . " 
Her big worry is whether the messaging and communication went wrong . 
That is why , she says , she started to travel around the country to understand what people were " hearing when we were speaking " and improve dialogue and partnership to tackle the pandemic .
