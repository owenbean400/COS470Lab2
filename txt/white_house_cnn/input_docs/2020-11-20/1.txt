An early cold snap in the middle of the country at the end of September has helped drive the most recent surge of coronavirus infections , White House coronavirus adviser Dr . Deborah Birx said Thursday . 
People began moving indoors , she said . 
That ’s when transmission really begin to take off , especially with close to half of all infections asymptomatic , so people do not even realize they are infecting others . 
" So we have been going across the country to really tell them , ( the ) mid Atlantic states and the Northeast , to really increase testing , looking for these asymptomatic cases and I really want to thank the governors across this great land who have really heeded that call , " Birx told a White House briefing – the first public briefing by the task force since July . 
Birx said when states increase the use of masking and encourage people to avoid gatherings , it helps control the rise in cases . 
Health officials say smaller gatherings are helping drive the spread of the virus . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier on Thursday advised against traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday and urged Americans to celebrate the holiday only with household members .
