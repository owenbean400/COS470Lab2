White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said Americans should limit indoor gatherings to immediate households this Thanksgiving . 
" I do not like it to be any number , " she said . 
" Because you know , if you say it can be 10 , and it 's eight people from four different families , then that probably is not the same degree of safe as 10 people from your immediate household . " 
Birx said she understood why the lack of uniformity in open and close spaces across the country can make social distancing messaging confusing for Americans . 
" I worry about that , " she told CNN . 
" [ People ] say , ‘ Well , bars and restaurants are open , then I can have 20 people over for Thanksgiving . ’ " She also said Americans need to look at their choices when all this is over . 
Birx said it ’s on every American to protect each other . 
" I ’m making the personal sacrifices not to infect my parents and my pregnant daughter , and there 's a lot of people out there who know how to protect one another , and we just need to make sure we 're all doing that . "
