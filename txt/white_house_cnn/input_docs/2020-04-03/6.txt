Some public health experts at the US Centers for Disease Control felt " pressured " by the White House to draft recommendations that all Americans wear masks or facial coverings while in public , according to a senior federal health official involved in discussions . 
A source told CNN the " CDC was under intense pressure to do this quickly . " 
" It was more than we were comfortable with , the source added . 
" Things were done very fast . 
It 's a credibility risk to the agency . 
It 's not fabulous for credibility . 
There is a real worry that this will provide a false sense of security to the public . 
Also , up until now the CDC has been telling people it 's okay not to wear a mask , and it 's going to be recommended that we do . 
It runs the risk of confusing the public . "
