The coronavirus supplemental funding request is not expected to be finalized by tonight , a White House official said , but could come as early as tomorrow . 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter over the weekend demanding the coronavirus request contain " entirely new funding " after the White House â€™s initial request for a total of $ 2.5 billion last week involved moving half of that sum from existing funds and appropriating only $ 1.25 billion in fresh funding . 
A second White House official said the supplemental funding currently under discussion will now be " new money " and not reprogrammed funds . 
The supplemental funding is likely to be much larger than the amount the White House requested last week . 
Democrats , and even some Republicans , had questioned whether the administration asked for too little . 
The topline number currently being discussed is more than $ 7 billion , although that number is not yet locked down .
