Paul Mango , deputy chief of staff for policy at the US Department of Health and Human Services , said that the White House 's Operation Warp Speed was " absolutely on track ... if not a little ahead " in the race to have a Covid 19 vaccine by the end of the year . 
" We â€™re very pleased where we are right now , " Mango added . 
" We obviously have two of our six vaccine candidates that are in phase three clinical trials right now . ... 
We will have four vaccines in phase three clinical trials by the middle of next month . " 
Mango added that manufacturing is already underway for three vaccines . 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has previously said he 's " cautiously optimistic " the US could have safe and effective vaccine in late fall or early winter .
