On Friday , the White House coronavirus task force held its first public briefing in two months -- but health experts expressed concern afterward , saying Vice President Mike Pence offered little guidance for the country . 
The US recorded more than 40,000 new cases on Friday alone , and infection rates are going up in more than 30 states , forcing several to dial back their reopening efforts -- which Pence did not address in the briefing . 
" What I worry about now is the Fourth of July , " he added . 
" We had Memorial Day ; three or four weeks after that we had a peak in cases . 
Two or three more weeks from now , we 'll have a peak in deaths . " 
Michael Osterholm , director of the Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , warned that the US was " still just in the very beginning of the pandemic . " 
Only about 5-7 % of the US population has been infected so far , he said , and herd immunity would require about 60-70 % be infected . 
" So , when you think about all the pain , suffering , death , economic disruption we 've had , think about how much more we have to go , " he added .
