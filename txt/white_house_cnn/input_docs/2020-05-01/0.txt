A coronavirus model relied on by the White House task force is projecting that about 72,000 people in the United States will die from the virus by early August -- an increase from earlier estimates . 
Dr . Chris Murray , who leads the team that did the modeling at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , told CNN 's global town hall that the number has gone up " because we 've seen these protracted peaks in some place , " citing New York City as an example . 
How reopening factors in : Murray said the model assumes that many people will continue to practicing social distancing until the end of May . 
It does not yet account for certain states and cities partially reopening . 
Murray said his team is working on factoring that in , but it 's not simple .
