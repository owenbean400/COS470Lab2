Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation co founder Bill Gates believes at home coronavirus testing is crucial in fighting the pandemic . 
The philanthropist and founder of Microsoft shared this insight Thursday night during CNN 's coronavirus town hall . 
Some context on current testing : Gates said on April 26 that new testing machines and methods should soon be able to get the United States up to between 400,000 and 500,000 tests per day , though that 's " just barely enough for really doing the tracking . " 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , estimated on Saturday that the country is conducting approximately 1.5 million to 2 million Covid 19 tests per week and said it is likely the testing capacity could be doubled within the next several weeks . 
So far , the United States has only performed about 4 million coronavirus tests .
