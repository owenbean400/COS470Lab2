A prestigious scientific panel told the White House on Tuesday that it does not look coronavirus will go away once the weather warms up . 
President Donald Trump has claimed that " when it gets a little warmer [ the virus ] miraculously goes away . " 
In their letter to the White House , members of a National Academy of Sciences committee said data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather , but that it might not matter much given that so few people in the world are immune to coronavirus . 
The letter noted , for example , that a study of the outbreak in China showed that even under maximum temperature and humidity conditions , the virus spread " exponentially , " with every infected person spreading it to nearly two other people on average . 
The scientists sent the letter to Kelvin Droegemeier at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy . 
The letter from the NAS scientists notes that some laboratory studies have shown reduced transmission of the virus under warmer and more humid conditions , but that it 's still a concern . 
The letter points out that in the real world , the virus is still transmitting in countries with warm weather . 
" Given that countries currently in ' summer ' climates , such as Australia and Iran , are experiencing rapid virus spread , a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed , " the letter said .
