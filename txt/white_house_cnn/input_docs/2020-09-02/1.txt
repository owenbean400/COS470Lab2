A White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in Iowa this week warns of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas of the state and calls for a mask mandate , the closure of bars and a plan from universities as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest . 
CNN has obtained the nine page Aug . 30 report for the state , first reported by the Des Moines Register , from the Iowa Department of Public Health .

"
