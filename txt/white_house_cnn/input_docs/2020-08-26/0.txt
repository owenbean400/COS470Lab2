The head of the US Food and Drug Administration says he should have been more careful when explaining the benefits of convalescent plasma . 
" I was trying to do what I do with patients , because patients often understand things in absolute terms versus relative terms , " Dr . Stephen Hahn told Bloomberg News in an interview Tuesday . 
In a series of tweets Monday , Hahn admitted he had mischaracterized the benefits of convalescent plasma at a White House event announcing the emergency use authorization ( EUA ) . 
He had said studies showed plasma could prevent 35 deaths out of 100 -- something that studies did not show . 
A titer refers to the concentration of something -- in this case a specific antibody in a dose of convalescent plasma . 
The plasma is made using the blood of people who have recovered from coronavirus infections . 
The misleading comments have caused concerns about how honest the FDA will be about any eventual authorization or approval of a Covid 19 vaccine . 
Hahn admitted to Bloomberg he 's worried that it could hurt the FDA â€™s reputation with the American public .
