Olivia Troye , a former top adviser to Vice President Mike Pence , said that some members of the Trump administration continue to shrug off the coronavirus pandemic . 
More than 205,000 Americans have now died due to Covid 19 , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Troye said that the Centers for Disease and Prevention was pushed to play down the risks of Covid 19 in reopening schools . 
She said people in the White House tasked more junior level staffers to find data to support the narrative that the coronavirus only affects older individuals . 
The American people have " been told falsities , " Troye said . 
" They â€™ve not been told the truth . 
They also need to remember this is a person making decisions on how we respond to events like this . 
And this was a major one . 
And it was just very poorly handled . [ Trump ] only cared about himself . "
