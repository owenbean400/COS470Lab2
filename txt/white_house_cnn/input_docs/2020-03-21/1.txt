Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , stressed that not all Americans should be tested for coronavirus during a White House press conference Saturday . 
Fauci noted if people get tested unnecessarily , they will utilize important personal protective equipment that could be used for those who do need to be tested or are at a greater risk . 
Fauci noted that right now there are disparities in the amount of available personal protective equipment though , " we are working hard to correct that . " 
Fauci also reiterated doctors should put off elective surgeries for the time being so they do not put themselves of others at risk by utilizing medical equipment .
