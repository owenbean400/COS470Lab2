In response to concerns from some doctors complaining about shortage of supplies , President Trump defended the White House â€™s coronavirus response and placed part of the blame on previous administrations . 
Trump added : " And we are making much of this stuff now and much of it is being delivered now . 
We 've also gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people that ca not believe how fast it 's coming . 
When I hear they have an order of 55 million masks and that is just one order , that 's one order , out of many , and there are many millions of masks beyond that , and I keep saying , how is it possible to use so much ? 
But that 's the way it is . "
