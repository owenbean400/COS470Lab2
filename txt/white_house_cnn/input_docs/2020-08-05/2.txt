Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Wednesday that the White House coronavirus task force will take a " careful look " at air droplets and their role in the spread of Covid 19 , to see if new guidance is warranted . 
Fauci , speaking to CNN â€™s Dr . Sanjay Gupta during a Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health forum , said he 's been in touch with experts about the possibility that there may be droplets much bigger than five micrometers that continue to float around in the air . 
Fauci said the possibility of bigger droplets " gives you a greater reason for wearing a mask at all times , " and that being outdoors is much better than being indoors . 
He added there may be a need to rethink air circulation when indoors , including filtering air with HEPA filters .
