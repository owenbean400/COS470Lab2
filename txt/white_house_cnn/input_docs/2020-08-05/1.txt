The negotiators are , at long last , actually negotiating . 
After seven meetings , totaling more than a dozen hours , the top Democratic and White House negotiators are not just walking through their disagreements , but putting offers on the table , trading proposals and to a small degree , starting to make concessions . 
They 've even agreed on a deadline for a deal — the end of this week . 
Bottom line : There is still a long way to go and an agreement to a timeline to reach an agreement — one that is already one week after the initial deadline — is not much on its face . 
But what 's happening behind the scenes is a signal things are actually starting to kick into gear .

Schumer said both sides made concessions and , most importantly , the talks had gone beyond identifying areas of disagreement or even topline points of overlap and have now moved to trading actual paper proposals between sides . 
It seems minor or just an obvious step in the process , but the trading of paper means things are getting real , finally . 
That came in large part due to what the White House negotiators put on the table . 
To be clear , these proposals were not agreed to and wo not be accepted by Democrats ( much to the frustration of the administration negotiators ) . 
But they represent tangible movement -- the type of movement that can draw out real concessions and counters .
