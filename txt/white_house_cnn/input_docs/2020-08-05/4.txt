Infectious disease experts in the United States are calling on the White House to issue a federal mask requirement across all states . 
Dr . Thomas File , president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America , and Dr . Judith Feinberg , chair of the HIV Medicine Association , sent a letter on behalf of their organizations to US Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday . 
The letter urges the White House Coronavirus Task Force to adopt a uniform policy on wearing masks . 
The two health experts said that " while state and local requirements are particularly effective at increasing the use of masks , this is the time for national solidarity as Covid 19 has made significant inroads into rural areas that were initially considered ' safe . ' " " Policies to greatly increase the use of masks are integral to a broader national strategy to control the Covid 19 pandemic , which must also include increasing testing capacity and its timeliness to bolster the impact of contact tracing , " the pair wrote .
