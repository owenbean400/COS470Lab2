Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said he has not seen any indication of pressure from the White House to rush a coronavirus vaccine out before the Nov . 3 election . 
Fauci noted that there â€™s a data and safety monitoring board that oversees the vaccine trials . 
He said timing will only be determined by the information coming from the trials . 
" We have assurances , and I 've discussed this with the regulatory authorities , that they promised that they are not going to let political considerations interfere with a regulatory decision because we 've spoken explicitly about that , because the subject obviously comes up and the people in charge of the regulatory process assures that safety and efficacy is going to be the prime consideration , " Fauci added . 
Some context : As of Aug . 5 , there are 26 vaccines in human trials around the world , including four in the US . 
Separately , US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said in a Washington Post commentary that his agency would not cut corners in approving a vaccine .
