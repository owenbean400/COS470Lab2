For the first time in 11 weeks , there will be no member of the White House 's coronavirus task force on CNN 's global town hall . 
There has not been a full White House briefing on coronavirus in 17 days , CNN 's Anderson Cooper said . 
Cooper added that technology is not an excuse for why no task force member could attend the town hall since " nearly all the medical staff from the task force appeared remotely in front of the Senate on Tuesday . " 
" So their computers work . 
This is just the latest example of the White House trying to put as much distance between the President and this virus as possible , " Cooper said .
