As the US has passed 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases and a trusted model is projecting a steep increase in the fall , Vice President Mike Pence will lead a White House coronavirus task force meeting today . 
The task force will meet at 2:30 p.m . ET in the Situation Room , according to Pence ’s schedule . 
This will be the second meeting this week – the group last met on Tuesday . 
The meeting also comes as President Trump is moving full steam ahead with reopening and packed campaign rallies , returning to the campaign trail next week for a rally in Tulsa , his first since March 2 . 
Pence is also set to return to the campaign trail for the first time since he was tapped to lead the task force , attending an event for the Trump aligned America First super PAC tomorrow in Pennsylvania . 
As CNN reported last month , the task force has been sharply curtailed , meeting about once a week . 
Task force members have been on conference calls with governors weekly , but there has not been a briefing from the task force since April 27 . 
And Pence , the task force leader , openly flouted CDC guidelines yesterday , posting a photo with a large group of tightly clustered campaign staff at headquarters with no masks . 
The cap on gatherings is 10 people in Virginia . 
The tweet has since been deleted .
