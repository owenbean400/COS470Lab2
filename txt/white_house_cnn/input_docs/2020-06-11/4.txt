As the number of coronavirus cases in Alabama has essentially not dropped in weeks , Montgomery , Alabama , Mayor Steven Reed said he thinks the state opened up too early . 
" Montgomery should not be 10 % of Alabama 's total cases . 
We should not have the level of cases that we â€™ve had spike month over month and week over week when we look at our numbers . 
There 's still a problem here , " he said . 
Leaders in the White House who do not wear masks are not helping the situation , Reed said , responding to a now delated tweet from Vice President Pence with a photo showing Trump campaign staff not social distancing or donning masks . 
Reed said they have not factored in all post Memorial Day coronavirus testing numbers yet . 
" We cannot decide when this is over . 
The virus will decide that . 
And we have to make sure that we 're doing everything that we can as leaders to inform our public of where we are our hospital beds , as in Montgomery , where only 2 % of our ICU beds are available . 
That 's problematic . 
It 's manageable , but not sustainable , " he said .
