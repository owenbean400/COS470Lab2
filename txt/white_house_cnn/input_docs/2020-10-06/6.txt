House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement reacting to a series of tweets from President Trump announcing he was pulling the plug on stimulus negotiations . 
" Clearly , the White House is in complete disarray , " she said . 
" Walking away from coronavirus talks demonstrates that President Trump is unwilling to crush the virus , as is required by the Heroes Act . 
He shows his contempt for science , his disdain for our heroes — in health care , first responders , sanitation , transportation , food workers , teachers , teachers , teachers and others — and he refuses to put money in workers ’ pockets , unless his name is printed on the check , " she continued . 
Some background : The decision to pull the plug on the talks is a major blow to Americans still struggling with the fallout from the once in a century pandemic and endangers an economic recovery that for months was driven by the initial $ 2.2 trillion stimulus passed by Congress in the spring . 
With that money largely spent and gone , economists have warned more support is imperative in the months ahead . 
While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi were still far apart on a final agreement , according to multiple people involved , they were still very much in negotiations — with the two scheduled to talk by phone Tuesday afternoon and having continued to trade paper and legislative text over the last several days .
