The White House has blocked new guidelines by the US Food and Drug Administration governing a potential Covid 19 vaccine , according to a report in The New York Times . 
CNN reported last month that the FDA was considering new guidelines that would likely push an authorization beyond Election Day , according to three sources familiar with the situation . 
That timeline would dash President Donald Trump 's hopes of a pre election authorization -- he has repeatedly said the vaccine could be ready by November 3 . 
This week , the FDA told CNN the guidance " remains under review . " 
And Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , says the FDA plans to make sure any vaccine is safe . 
The FDA told CNN Monday night that even though the guidance remains under review , it does not change how the agency would evaluate an emergency use authorization request for a Covid 19 vaccine . 
" They have career scientists who could develop these kind of models of what you need to do to assure safety and to assure efficacy , " Fauci said . 
" And right now , this is what they said and we 'll see what happens . "
