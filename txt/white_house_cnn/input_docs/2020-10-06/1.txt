Less than a week after reopening , schools in some New York City neighborhoods will close beginning Tuesday as the city tries to get ahead of a worrisome spread of Covid 19 . 
Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday proposed temporarily closing all schools and nonessential businesses in nine ZIP codes with high test positivity rates in Brooklyn and Queens beginning Wednesday , pending state approval . 
Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo approved part of that plan , agreeing to close schools in those nine hotspot areas and moving their closures up to Tuesday . 
He declined , though , to close nonessential businesses and religious institutions . 
The decision to roll back reopenings in those areas highlights the challenge facing cities , states , universities and businesses as they try to balance the need to reopen the economy with ensuring public health and safety during the pandemic . 
By any measure , the US has failed this challenge : temporary layoffs have become permanent , the President was in the hospital after a White House outbreak and more than 40,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with Covid 19 every day .
