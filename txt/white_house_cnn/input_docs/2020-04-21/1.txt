The number of coronavirus deaths in the US could surpass modeling estimates of 60,000 if some states move too quickly in reopening , a source close to the White House coronavirus task force warns . 
The source pointed to the governors in South Carolina and Georgia deciding to reopen businesses , even as those states have yet to meet " gating " guidelines laid out by the administration last week . 
" Not good , " the source said . 
The gating guidelines determine when states can reopen restaurants , bars , gyms and public spaces , as well as providing guidance for employers . 
These criteria include a sustained decrease in cases over a 14 day period and a return to pre crisis conditions in hospitals .
