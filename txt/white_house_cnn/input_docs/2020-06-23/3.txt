The Trump administration is racing to replenish the country 's national supply stockpile , despite conflicting messaging from officials about the potential severity of a second wave of the virus . 
Nearly half of states are reporting a rise in new cases and some continue to break records in their daily reported cases . 
Behind the scenes , officials are trying to execute on a newly envisioned Strategic National Stockpile , informally called " SNS 2.0 , " and restock the country 's supply before a possible fall resurgence . 
State officials are taking matters into their own hands and working on bolstering their own stockpiles , following the supply scramble that unfolded earlier this year . 
The Health and Human Services Department , which maintains the stockpile , has outlined efforts to replenish its coffers , but has not disclosed exactly much supply it currently has . 
The preparations underway acknowledge the looming possibility of another surge in coronavirus cases . 
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on CNN Sunday that the administration is " filling the stockpile in anticipation of a possible problem in the fall , " but on Monday , White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC there wo not be a second wave , saying , " there is no second wave coming .
