Kathleen Sebelius , former secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , says that while the country is doing more testing for Covid 19 , we are still " way behind the virus . " 
Documented cases continue to grow , as do hospitalizations and deaths in some parts of the country . 
" We are still not testing enough , " Sebelius said . 
Sebelius was critical of US President Donald Trump , who told supporters at a rally Saturday that testing was " a double edged sword . " 
" I said to my people , ' Slow the testing down , please , ' " he said . 
Soon after Trump made the comment , White House officials asserted the President was joking . 
" We are still not testing enough , but he ’s a man who does not want ‘ his ’ numbers -- whatever those are , " Sebelius said . 
" Those are patients , as far as I ’m concerned -- people who have lost loved ones . "
