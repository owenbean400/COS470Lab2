White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said that he believes another tax rebate or direct mail checks to Americans " are on the table " as part of an additional stimulus package , but he hopes they would be targeted to those who lost their jobs or are most in need . 
He stressed that no decisions have been made yet . 
Kudlow again said he thinks the discussion on a new stimulus package will begin after the July 4 congressional recess . 
He said " absolutely , definitely " there will not be a second lockdown . 
He said that while there are some hotspots across the country , case rates are also dropping in many places . 
As of this morning , 25 states were seeing an increase in new coronavirus cases over the past week .
