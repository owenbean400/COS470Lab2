Asked whether his comment on slowing down testing was a joke , President Trump told reporters " I do not kid " as he departed the White House for campaign events in Arizona . 
Trump again said that testing is a " double edged sword " and praised the country 's testing program saying the US has the " greatest testing program anywhere in the world . " 
What this is about : In a shocking admission during his Tulsa , Oklahoma , rally on Saturday night , Trump said he had told officials in his administration to slow down coronavirus testing because of the rising number of cases in America . 
Some administration officials had tried to downplay Trump 's remarks from Saturday 's rally . 
An administration official told CNN later Saturday that the President was " obviously kidding , " and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday that the remark was made " in jest . " 
On Monday , White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany also told reporters that Trump was speaking " in jest . " 
" He has not directed ( coronavirus testing to be slowed ) , and , in fact , I would note that first we continue to test about 500,000 per day , about half a million people per day , " Mc Enany said in the briefing . 
" $ 1.8 billion dollars is invested in NIH to find new testing capabilities , any suggestion that testing has been curtailed is not rooted in fact . " 
" It was a comment that he made in jest , " Mc Enany added .
