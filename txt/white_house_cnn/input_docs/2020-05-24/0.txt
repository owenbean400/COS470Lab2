National Security Adviser Robert O ’Brien said Sunday the administration is likely to announce new restrictions on travel to Brazil . 
O ’Brien , during an interview with CBS , said the administration is likely to make a decision about restricting travel to Brazil today , and said White House officials " hope that will be temporary . " 
He said the White House would " take a look at the other countries on a country by country basis " in that region . 
When asked about reporting that the European travel restrictions from mid March came too late to stop the virus from spreading through the US , O ’Brien highlighted President Trump ’s decision to restrict some travel to China . 
O 'Brien suggested that US officials were unaware that people traveling through Europe from China could bring Covid 19 to America in the weeks before the European travel restrictions were implemented . 
Some context : Coronavirus has yet to peak in Sao Paulo , Brazil 's largest and worst infected big city , but the healthcare system is already beginning to break down . 
As the crisis deepens and the number of deaths continues to rise , President Jair Bolsonaro is urging businesses to reopen . 
He opposes many governors who are stressing social distancing measures to slow the spread . 
Far from hospitals , Brazil 's indigenous people are dying at an alarming rate . 
The death toll is double that of the rest of Brazil 's population , according to the advocacy group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil .
