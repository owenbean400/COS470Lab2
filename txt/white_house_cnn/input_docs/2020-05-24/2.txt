Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said on Sunday that there is " clear scientific evidence " masks work . 
When asked whether President Trump should wear one , Birx said she assumes he is able to keep 6 feet of distance " in a majority of cases . " 
" Well the President did wear a mask while he was less than 6 feet in an occasion where that was important – I think when he was traveling last week , " Birx added . 
" I ’m not with him every day and every moment , so I do not know if he can maintain social distance . " 
Regarding the large crowds who were not socially distancing seen on some beaches Saturday , Birx said on ABC : " I think it 's our job as public health officials every day to be informing the public of what puts them at risk . 
And we have made it clear that there 's asymptomatic spread . 
And that means that people are spreading the virus unknowingly . "
