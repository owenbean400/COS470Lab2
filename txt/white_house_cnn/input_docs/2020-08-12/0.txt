" We want them to open soon and safely , " she said during an appearance on Fox News , adding that they will be announcing " eight measures on how to do that . " 
She later told reporters that there will be guidance and resources , but decisions will ultimately need to be made at a state and local level . 
Conway noted that parents in surveys " overwhelmingly say they feel safe " and that President Trump is " on the side of parents . " 
Conway also criticized Democrats for abandoning stimulus negotiations , reiterating Mnuchin ’s statement earlier today that Democrats are more interested in Nov . 3 .
