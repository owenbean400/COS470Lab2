US Surgeon General Jerome Adams discussed some specific data that shows who is at risk for novel coronavirus . 
" People over the age of 60 are much more likely to develop complications from the coronavirus and to be hospitalized , " Adams said , adding that the average age of death from coronavirus is 80 . 
Children and young adults are more likely to die from the flu than coronavirus , Adams said during brief remarks at Monday 's White House press briefing . 
He added that people should " be reassured by that . " 
However , he noted , even though young people are not at risk for dying from coronavirus , they could potentially spread the virus to people in communities and people with chronic diseases , reiterating basic precautions to prevent community spread , such as covering coughs .
