Former Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn says that the government will likely need to bail out airlines if the coronavirus crisis persists and that monetary stimulus will not help ease the economic pain . 
" If this crisis lasts another week or two , we should bail out the airlines , " said Cohn , who added that government assistance would help prevent major layoffs . 
Cohn called the Fed â€™s decision for an emergency rate cut ineffective . 
" You ca not fight an emotional and psychological war with financial easing , " Cohn said .
