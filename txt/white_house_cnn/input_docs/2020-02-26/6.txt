President Trump said the Americans who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus are doing " very well . " 
Trump said he had just been briefed by members of his administration . 
" Of the 15 people … eight of them have returned to their homes , to stay at their homes until they ’re fully recovered . 
One is in the hospital . 
And five have fully recovered . 
And one we think is in pretty good shape , " Trump said at the White House . 
" In almost all cases , they ’re getting better , " Trump said . 
He added that there are also patients who were brought back to the US from Japan . 
" We took in some from Japan … because they ’re American citizens . 
They ’re in quarantine and they ’re getting better , too , " Trump said , adding that they were repatriated because " we felt that we had an obligation to do that . " 
" We could have left them and that would have been very bad , very bad , " he said .
