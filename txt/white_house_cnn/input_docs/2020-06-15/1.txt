Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the campaign will conduct temperature checks and give out face masks and hand sanitizer at the President ’s upcoming rally in Tulsa , Oklahoma , as Tulsa health officials express skepticism over whether this is the right time for a large campaign event . 
" I saw the campaign tweeted out they ’ve got about a million RSVPs , that ’s quite extraordinary , " Conway said at the White House Monday . 
" And that they ’re doing temperature checks , giving everybody a face mask , and hand sanitizer . " 
" It sounds like the campaign is taking steps that comport with what the CDC has said , and possibly even Tulsa , or state of Oklahoma guidelines , " she continued . 
" I ’d have to look at that , see what phase they ’re in . 
They ’re pretty well along there in Oklahoma . " 
Conway called those decisions " good , " and " a recognition that there are guidelines in place that should be followed . " 
" We certainly hope that the people in Oklahoma will adhere to all the reasonable guidelines , " she added .
