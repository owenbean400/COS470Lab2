America 's top infectious disease expert , Dr . Anthony Fauci , has described the challenges of working with the Trump administration during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Asked how he responds to falsehoods from the President during news conferences , Fauci said , " I ca not jump in front of the microphone and push him down . " 
" OK , he said it . 
Let 's try and get it corrected for the next time , " Fauci said , according to an interview published by the journal Science . 
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , Fauci has advised six presidents and has played a central role in the White House ’s coronavirus task force . 
Fauci said he and the President " disagree on some things . " 
But he described Trump as responsive , saying : " He goes his own way . 
He has his own style . 
But on substantive issues , he does listen to what I say . " 
Virus timeline : Fauci was asked about some of Trump ’s comments , including his assertion that China should have told US officials about the coronavirus three months sooner . 
That would have been around September , and there is no evidence Chinese officials were aware of the virus at that time . 
" It just does not comport with facts , " said Jon Cohen , the interviewer . 
" I know , but what do you want me to do ? " 
Fauci replied . 
" I mean , seriously Jon , let ’s get real . 
What do you want me to do ? " 
Terminology : Fauci also said he had never used the term " China virus . " 
Asked if he ever would , Fauci responded , " No . "
