US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said a bipartisan deal could be reached shortly on the coronavirus bill . 
Schumer argued that Mc Connell is setting " arbitrary vote deadlines " by continuing to set up procedural votes when a bipartisan deal has not yet been reached , downplaying the failed vote yesterday by emphasizing that the real action is the ongoing talks , not procedural votes . 
Schumer noted he is meeting regularly with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House legislative director Eric Ueland to hash out a deal . 
" We hope and expect to conclude negotiations today , " he said . 
He called the bill they are discussing " the largest emergency funding bill in American history . " 
Schumer addressed the news that Sen . 
Amy Klobuchar â€™s husband as well as Sen . 
Rand Paul have tested positive . 
" I want to let them know , both of them , that the Senate is thinking of them and praying for their speedy recovery , " he said .
