President Trump on Monday opened the coronavirus task force briefing by echoing his tweet on Asian Americans , a message that comes after days of casting coronavirus as " China virus " and " Chinese virus . " 
After consulting with medical experts , and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization , CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing . 
" It ’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world . 
They ’re amazing people . 
And the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way , shape , or form . 
They ’re working closely with us to get rid of it . 
We will prevail together , it ’s very important , " he said , emphasizing the word " Asian . " 
Note that Trump used the words " they " and " us " when referring to Asian Americans . 
He also extended well wishes to a member of the White House press corps who is awaiting coronavirus test results . 
" I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem . 
We appreciate you being here . 
This is getting to be more and more social distancing and that 's fine , that 's the way it should be ... 
We extend our best wishes to the person affected , " he said .
