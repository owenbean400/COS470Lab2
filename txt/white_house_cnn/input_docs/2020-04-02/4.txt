President Donald Trump said Thursday in additional to the issuance of a memorandum invoking the Defense Production Act to supply ventilator supplies to manufacturers , he has also invoked the act against 3M for face masks . 
" I just signed against 3M for face masks , " Trump said during the White House press briefing . 
" We signed an element of the act against 3M . 
Hopefully they ’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do . " 
3M , which is the largest maker of medical face masks and more specifically the N95 respirator mask , said in a statement earlier this week that it already doubled its global output in January , and also plans " to double our capacity once again , to 2 billion globally within the next 12 months – and some of that additional capacity will begin to come online in the next 60-90 days . " 
In the US , 3M said it expects to produce 50 million 95 respirators per month in June , a 40 percent jump from current levels . 
Even with accelerated production , the company 's CEO Mike Roman acknowledged in a statement that " the reality is that demand for N95 respirators is much higher than the industries ’ ability to deliver . 
That is why we continue to explore innovative partnerships and solutions to help protect our healthcare workers in this extraordinary time . "
