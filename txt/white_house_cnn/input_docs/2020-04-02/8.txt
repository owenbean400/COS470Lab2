" There is a black market which you have described , where we ’re having people bid against each other , brokers come in , they ’re bidding and bidding on all this different ( personal protective equipment ) , " Navarro , the White House ’s Defense Production Act policy coordinator , said during the White House briefing . 
" It ’s driving the price up and guess what ? 
You know where it ’s going ? 
The domestic sources here are being exported . "
