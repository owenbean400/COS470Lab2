US President Donald Trump will sign the coronavirus relief package once it reaches his desk , according to White House spokesman Ben Williamson . 
" President Trump has pushed hard for months to send Americans badly needed financial relief . 
We look forward to Congress sending a bill to his desk imminently for signature , " Williamson said . 
US Congressional leaders announced Sunday night that they had secured a deal for a sweeping $ 900 billion rescue package to deliver much needed relief for small businesses , unemployed Americans and health care workers while bolstering vaccine distribution . 
The announcement follows policy disputes and partisan finger pointing between Democrats and Republicans that fueled uncertainty over whether lawmakers would manage to close out a deal or whether talks would collapse with lawmakers soon set to leave Washington for the holidays and the end of the 116th Congress in sight .
