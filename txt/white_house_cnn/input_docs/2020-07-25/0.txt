White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon for talks on a new coronavirus stimulus bill . 
The White House and Senate Republicans are trying to hammer out their differences over a proposal expected to be unveiled next week after an unexpected delay . 
Meadows is meeting with the chief of staff of Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , a source with direct knowledge of the meeting told CNN . 
The meeting is more of a check in because there are a number of items the various parties still need to agree on , the source said . 
The primary hold up , two sources told CNN , was differences over the extension of the federal unemployment enhancement , specifically how Republicans would implement their changes to the $ 600 a week program that expires July 31 . 
Both sides are also still going over the legislative text of agreed upon pieces , which Meadows acknowledged is a time consuming process . 
Some context : Mc Connell said in remarks on the Senate floor late Thursday that the Trump administration asked for more time to review the plan and that it should be out " early next week . " 
" The administration has requested additional time to review the fine details , but we will be laying down this proposal early next week , " he said . 
Mc Connell said that key GOP senators who have helped craft the package will introduce component pieces of the bill on Monday .
