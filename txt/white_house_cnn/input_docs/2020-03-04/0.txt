Vice President Mike Pence pledged that upcoming briefings on coronavirus would be on camera , following a Tuesday evening on the record briefing led by Pence that the White House press office insisted remain off camera . 
The press office also insisted that reporters not broadcast any sound from the briefing , in which the vice president announced several new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiatives , including a change in policy that now allows any American to receive a coronavirus test , if a doctor deems it necessary . 
When pressed about the briefing being off camera , Pence said it was because President Trump had already made multiple on camera statements today . 
" You ’re going to see us in here every day answering questions … but the president was at NIH today and the president addressed the country today , " Pence said . 
He added that " I expect we ’ll be back on camera tomorrow . " 
Some context : On two occasions last week , Trump and members of the Coronavirus Task Force briefed reporters on camera from the briefing room .
