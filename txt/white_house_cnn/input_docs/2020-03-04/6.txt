As he massaged a glob of Purell into his hands and headed into a lunch with Republican senators , Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell said if they get " cooperation " from all senators they plan to pass the emergency funding for the coronavirus outbreak " this week . " 
" Our goal would be to do it this week , if we get cooperation , " Mc Connell said , shortly after a broad agreement was reached and House leaders said they planned to vote on it in the next few hours . 
GOP Sen . 
Roy Blunt of Missouri said he anticipates some budget conscious Republicans will vote against the $ 7.8 billion package because of its large price tag but did not indicate who might oppose it . 
" Not everyone will vote for the bill . 
But they would not have voted for it at $ 2.2 billion either , " Blunt said referring to the much smaller original supplemental request from the White House . 
GOP Whip John Thune said if some members push for procedural votes because they have concerns with the bill , it could slow things down , but he was hopeful the Senate would pass it " fairly quickly . " 
Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby of Alabama , who directed talks for Senate Republicans , was more hopeful . 
He repeatedly predicted the bill would pass Thursday . 
Asked about his use of Purell , which came from a large jug placed on a desk in the foyer of his leadership suite , Mc Connell replied : " It â€™s good to have it these days . " 
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer confirms in a tweet that the House will vote today on the coronavirus funding package .
