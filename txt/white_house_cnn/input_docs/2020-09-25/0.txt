Growing skepticism about a potential Covid 19 vaccine is an " enormous " problem , Dr . William Schaffner , a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said Thursday on CNN . 
It ’s a big problem , Schaffner told CNN ’s Erin Burnett , " because once we do develop a vaccine , obviously we want people to accept it , but there ’s growing skepticism … in the general population . " 
Recent polls have shown many Americans say they wo not get a coronavirus vaccine . 
Reputational damage : Schaffner also said the reputation of both the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC are " tainted because of political interference . " 
" I ’m worried , " he said . 
" Both the reputation of the FDA and the CDC unfortunately have been tainted because of political interference , and even just this recent FDA wishing to change the , the ground rules for the development of the vaccine has to go to the White House for approval , that 's totally inappropriate , " he said . 
" It 's never happened before , should not happen . " 
US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the White House could override the FDA if the agency released tougher standards for the authorization of a Covid 19 vaccine , calling such a move " political . " 
The FDA is considering new coronavirus vaccine guidelines that would make it unlikely a Covid 19 vaccine could be authorized or approved by Election Day -- a timeline Trump has repeatedly openly pushed for .
