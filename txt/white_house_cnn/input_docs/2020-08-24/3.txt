Dr . Paul Offit , who serves on the Food and Drug Administration 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , told CNN 's Jake Tapper today he 's seen evidence the White House has pressured the agency in regards to the approval of coronavirus treatments . 
Offit said he feared the FDA 's surprise authorization on Sunday of the use of blood plasma from coronavirus survivors as a treatment for new patients was done under political pressure as no new data had emerged that would explain the sudden shift . 
He went on to say that " last night there was a change of heart by the FDA without any new data so one can only conclude that there had to be pressure on the FDA to do that . " 
Offit also pointed to the FDA 's treatment of the anti malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as evidence the agency had felt pressure from the White House " for some quick , fast cure " for Covid 19 . 
While Offit said he believed the plasma therapy presents little danger to Covid 19 patients , he said the pattern of political pressure could become dangerous especially if a vaccine enters the final stages of approval . 
" It just worries me that it sets yet another precedent to make you worry about the fact that the administration 's willing to bully its science based agencies , " he said . 
But Hahn , who leads the FDA , defended his organization on Sunday saying he makes decisions " on data only , " denying he was pressured by the White House to issue the emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma . 
" I took an oath as a doctor 35 years ago to do no harm . 
I abide by that every day , " Hahn said in a statement to CNN ’s Jim Acosta . 
" I ’ve never been asked to make any decision at the FDA based on politics , " he wrote . 
" The decisions the scientists at the FDA are making are done on data only . "
