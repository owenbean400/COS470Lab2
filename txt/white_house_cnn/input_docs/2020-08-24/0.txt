US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said that his organization makes decisions " on data only , " denying he was pressured by the White House to issue an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) for convalescent plasma . 
The FDA issued an EUA for blood plasma taken from coronavirus survivors as a treatment for Covid 19 infections late Sunday , just before a White House briefing where US President Donald Trump called the decision " historic . " 
Several medical experts told CNN Sunday that the EUA decision seemed to have been made under pressure . 
Speaking at the briefing , Trump tacitly admitted he pressured the agency . 
Trump said he believed there were officials at the FDA and in the Department of Health and Human Services " that can see things being held up and would not mind so much . " 
" It 's my opinion , very strong opinion , and that 's for political reasons , " Trump said at Sunday â€™s briefing . 
Hahn denied the decision was made for anything other than legitimate medical reasons .
