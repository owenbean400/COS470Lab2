The Trump administration has pivoted away from receiving daily guidance from the White House Coronavirus Task Force to focus more heavily on the economy , US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr . Anthony Fauci said Friday . 
" The way things have evolved at the White House is that there has been a pivot away from the reliance on a daily type of a taskforce discussion -- policy making , policy implementation -- more towards how we 're going to get this country open again , economically , " Fauci told AIDS activist Peter Staley on Friday during an Instagram Live . 
He added that the Task Force has a good level of interaction with the Vice President . 
" Obviously it 's clear that the Task Force does not meet as often as we used to . 
We used to meet at one point , 7 days a week , then five days a week . 
We 're meeting now on an average of one and at the most two times a week , " Fauci said .
