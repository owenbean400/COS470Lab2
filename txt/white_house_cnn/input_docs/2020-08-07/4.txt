The latest numbers in the July jobs report show that the US will see unemployment drop " well into single digits as we move through the summer and fall , " White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow tells CNN 's Poppy Harlow . 
" To go through a tough month like that and still get 1.8 million new jobs and most importantly the unemployment rate back down to 10.2 % , I would just say to you , Poppy , that the idea that we wo not get a single digit unemployment rate is off the boards now . " 
The US added another 1.8 million jobs in July , which is a sharp slowdown from June and a small step for an economy that 's still down nearly 13 million jobs . 
But Kudlow says it â€™s a " solid number beating expectations . " 
He dismissed the idea of a slowdown and said the surge in coronavirus cases in July impacted the numbers . 
" I do not know that there 's a slowdown . 
These job numbers will go up and down . "
