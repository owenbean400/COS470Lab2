Restaurants in Baltimore will be allowed to reopen at 5 p.m . ET today , with indoor dining limited to 25 % , despite White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx naming the Maryland city as an area of concern . 
Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr . Letitia Dzirasa said she herself would not advise going out to eat indoors at a restaurant , instead encouraging residents to eat outside or order takeout . 
She said officials are facing " very tough " decisions to balance health and economic concerns . 
Dzirasa said the city ’s Covid 19 positivity rate is at about 5.8 % . 
" At the beginning of July , it was 5.1 % , and it ’s well above the state 's average , which was around 4 % , " she said . 
Dzirasa attributed the rise to larger gatherings . 
" I think that particularly in young people , which is where we 're seeing this higher rate of cases and this higher positivity rate , they could be asymptomatic and getting together and potentially spreading it , " she said .
