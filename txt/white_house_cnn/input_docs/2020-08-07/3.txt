White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said President Trump could pick up " the slack " on unemployment benefits as stimulus negotiations in Congress are on the brink of collapse . 
" The President is looking very , very carefully … about using executive authority to take up the slack " on unemployment benefits , a payroll tax cut , extending the eviction moratorium , and providing a benefit for reemployment , Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business . 
Trump said he could sign an executive order on these issues as early as this afternoon . 
Specifically , Kudlow said a draft of a potential payroll tax cut " is basically completed , " and he believes Trump will use executive authority to implement it . 
A payroll tax cut has faced bipartisan opposition on the Hill . 
Trump had been pushing for a payroll tax cut — which would reduce the amount taken out of workers ' paychecks to fund federal programs including Social Security and Medicare — to be included in the congressional stimulus package . 
But many Republicans and most Democrats do not support it . 
Kudlow said he ca not predict when federal unemployment benefits might be back due to the stalled negotiations on Capitol Hill . 
The $ 600 benefit expired last week .
