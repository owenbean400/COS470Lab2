Dr . Moncef Slaoui , the head of the White House 's coronavirus vaccine effort , said he hopes that the high efficacy rates of the vaccine candidates will encourage those who may we have concerns about vaccines to get one . 
" I think people have misunderstood the level of efficacy that the FDA aimed for , which was to say , at least 50 % efficacy . 
Maybe people thought that was the efficacy of the vaccine , " he told CNN this morning . 
" It 's 95 % . 
It 's almost a full insurance against this pandemic . 
I think and I hope that 's gonna change people 's perception . " 
He added that it 's " very unfortunate " that the vaccine development process has become political . 
" I really think it 's very unfortunate that the whole process has been politicized and , therefore , the context has created conditions whereby people 's perception has been exacerbated and we are where we are today , " he said . 
He added that the vaccines are safe for Americans .
