Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , tonight acknowledged there had been a " lull " in public appearances from himself and top scientists on the White House Coronavirus Task Force , but suggested Americans could expect to hear more from the group soon . 
" There was a period of time there was a little bit lull in being out there with the press but I believe that 's going to change , " said Fauci in a response to a question from CNN 's Anderson Cooper on why Americans are no longer hearing from the group on a daily basis . 
Fauci has been absent from national television interviews over the last two weeks , as the White House moves ahead with reopening the economy . 
Asked if the task force was still robust , despite the fact that it met for the first time today in six days , Fauci said the focus shifted to reopening and the economic impact , but the shift was not at the cost of studying scientific issues . 
" We had a very good meeting today , " he said . 
" I was very pleased with it . "
