White House coronavirus task force member Dr . Anthony Fauci suggested it is impossible to know whether the US is nearing the end of the pandemic or still in the early stages , and that the outcome depends very much on Americans ' behavior going forward . 
" It ’s impossible to predict because when we were looking at the increase and then going down , if it had gone all the way down to baseline … then you could say ' if we hold tight , we may be in the 7th or 8th inning , ' " Fauci said , when asked by CNN 's Anderson Cooper where the US currently sits on the arc . 
" But that did not happen , " he added . 
Fauci went on to say the length of the pandemic will depend on how well Americans wear masks , socially distance and adhere to other actions that can slow and stop the virus 's spread . 
" The thing we need to do is we need to put out all the stops to get it down to baseline and to keep it there by doing the things that we ’ve been talking about , and that I ’ve been talking about consistently , " he said .
