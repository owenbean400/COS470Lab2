New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the federal government abandoned its responsibility in fighting the coronavirus . 
" It is time to wake up America . 
The White House has been in denial on coronavirus from the get go and the federal response has just been wrong . 
That ’s not a political statement . 
If you look at the facts , that ’s exactly what it says , " Cuomo said . 
Cuomo asked President Trump to do two things : " They should start telling the people of this country the truth , " Cuomo said . 
The governor also said reopening fast was not good for the economy and while the economy reopening is important , Cuomo noted , " When that virus spikes , the market goes down , not up . " 
" This was not a smart policy to rush reopening . 
It did not help the economy . 
It ’s the exact opposite . " 
Cuomo said the federal government has only set up 41 testing sites across the country compared to 750 sites set up in in New York by others including local governments .
