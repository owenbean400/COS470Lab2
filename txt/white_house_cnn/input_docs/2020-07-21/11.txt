We hope they ’re going to be unified and present something to us , " he said . 
Schumer slammed President Trump ’s efforts to deny additional money for testing and tracing . 
Some GOP senators have stressed that more money for testing is essential in the next stimulus . 
" I ’m really worried that we wo not have adequate testing in this new bill , " he added . 
This week is the last for which $ 600 federal unemployment benefits will be paid , which has served as a lifeline for many out of work in the country during the pandemic .
