President Trump receives multiple coronavirus tests every day , the White House said Tuesday . 
Explaining his reluctance to wear a mask in public , press secretary Kayleigh Mc Eneny described Trump as the " most tested man in America " who does not risk spreading the virus to others . 
Asked a follow up about the frequency of President Trump 's coronavirus tests , Mc Enany would say only that he is tested often but would not get into further details . 
" Sometimes it is more than one time a day , " she said . 
Previously , the White House had indicated Trump received regular coronavirus tests , as did people who come into close proximity to him . 
But the frequency of the tests — multiple per day — was not known . 
The White House utilizes the Abbott rapid test , which has drawn scrutiny for high rates of false negatives . 
Mc Eneny said Trump has been " consistent " on masks , even though he refused for months to be photographed wearing one and downplayed their importance in containing coronavirus .
