President Trump said he does not know of a time he ’s taken more than one coronavirus test in a day , directly contradicting his press secretary in the first question of his press briefing Tuesday . 
" I do not know about more than one , " Trump responded to a reporter who asked why he was tested more than once a day . 
" I do probably on average a test every two days , three days , and I do not know of any time I ’ve taken two in one day , but I could see that happening . " 
Some background : Earlier Tuesday , the White House said Trump receives multiple coronavirus tests every day . 
Explaining his reluctance to wear a mask in public , press secretary Kayleigh Mc Eneny described Trump as the " most tested many in America " who does not risk spreading the virus to others . 
" He ’s tested more than anyone , multiple times a day , " she said . 
" And we believe that he ’s acting appropriately . "
