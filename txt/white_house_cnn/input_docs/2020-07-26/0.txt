Admiral Brett Giroir told CNN that Covid 19 testing must be brought under control as it relates to access and turnaround times . 
Giroir , a member of the White House ’s coronavirus task force , said " we are not going to stop our efforts until testing is exactly where we want it to be with rapid turnaround times . " 
Giroir said that over 54 million tests have been done , 770 thousand a day , which is a " 140 fold increase in terms of turnaround . " 
Around a quarter of the tests are point of care , with a 15 minute turnaround and that another quarter are done at local hospitals and labs , with a general turnaround of 24 hours , according to Giroir . 
" The delays that most people talk about are at the large commercial labs that perform about half the testing in our country , " he said . 
The data says that the average turnaround is about 4.27 days , according to Giroir . 
" I follow that morning and evening , I know exactly when it ’s ordered and when it ’s resulted , " he said . 
" We are trying to bring that down . " 
This week , pool testing was authorized at Quest and Lab Corp , which will improve efficiency , Giroir said .
