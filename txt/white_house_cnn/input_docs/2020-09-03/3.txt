A potential coronavirus vaccine should not get an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration , said Dr . Peter Hotez , the dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine . 
In a series of social media posts on Wednesday , Hotez listed a dozen reasons why an EUA on a potential Covid 19 vaccine may be a bad idea . 
An emergency use authorization allows the FDA to greenlight unapproved medical products -- but this involves substandard reviews , and falls short of the lengthy process needed for full approval . 
" How can you justify a substandard or lesser review for something that would be injected in tens of millions , maybe hundreds of millions of Americans ? " he asked . 
" I understand EUAs for ventilators , or PPE , etc , but not for a widely administered vaccine . " 
Hotez urged federal health agencies to " follow that process " of a full FDA review . 
He also argued that the White House â€™s lack of science communications strategy is another reason to follow the standard vaccine development process , saying the operation team has allowed " inadequate puzzling interviews " and " misleading press releases . "
