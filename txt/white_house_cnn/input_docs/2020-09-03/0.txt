The White House coronavirus task force has recommended officials in the state of Missouri close bars and mandate masks as the pandemic spreads . 
An August 30 report for the state , obtained by CNN , shows the state is in the task force â€™s defined " red zone " for cases , meaning more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population , with the 10th highest rate in the country . 
The August 30 report says community transmission " continues to be high in rural and urban counties , " and notes concerns with " increasing transmission in the major university towns , " which has been problematic for other states . 
" Bars must be closed , " the report reads . 
And , per the report , the task force recommends a mask mandate , saying , " Mask mandates across the state must be in place to decrease transmission . " 
The state is one of 15 in the US that does not require people to wear masks in public .
