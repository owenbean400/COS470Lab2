The White House has requested $ 1.25 billion in emergency funding to address coronavirus , as well as the ability to tap an additional $ 535 million in emergency funds already appropriated . 
This letter , obtained by CNN , was sent to the Hill just a short time ago . 
The Trump administration expects " to allocate at least $ 2.5 billion in total resources " for the response effort . 
Much of that would come from shifting already appropriated money from agency accounts .
