Asked about the sidelining of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic , former CDC director Dr . Tom Frieden said it was " like fighting with one arm tied behind your back . " 
Frieden , the CDC director under President Obama , was asked about the agency on Fox News this weekend . 
" Very briefly , do you think it ’s been a mistake for this administration to sideline the CDC ? " 
Fox ’s Chris Wallace asked . 
" I think fighting this pandemic without the CDC is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back , " Frieden said . 
These comments came after a discussion about the agency ’s role under the Trump administration . 
" As far back as I can remember , the CDC has always been the lead agency in health crises like this , " Wallace noted , pointing to Ebola and other diseases . 
" This time , it seems like the CDC has been sidelined to some degree , " Wallace said , noting the agency ’s lack of public briefings . 
Some context : CNN has previously reported on growing tensions between the White House and the CDC during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Senior administration officials in Washington and at the CDC , for example , have described a growing sense of mistrust and animosity over how quickly the US should reopen and how the government tracks data on the virus . 
CNN has also reported on tensions between the White House and CDC over guidelines on how to reopen the country . 
A leaked 68 page document from the agency described a detailed approach to reopening states and businesses , but those guidelines have not been publicly released . 
On Thursday , the CDC published six ages of graphics labeled " decision trees " as updated guidance .
