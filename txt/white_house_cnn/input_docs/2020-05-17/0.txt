Amid reports of growing tension between the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro slammed the top healthy agency , saying " it let the country down " on testing . 
A spokesperson for the CDC did not have any immediate comment . 
More from the White House : The comments from Navarro Sunday come as CNN reported that tensions are rising between the White House and the nation 's leading public health agency . 
In interviews , senior administration officials in Washington as well as top officials at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta described a growing sense of mistrust and animosity between the White House and CDC over how quickly the US should reopen and how the government tracks data on the virus . 
In particular , Dr . Deborah Birx , coordinator for the President 's coronavirus task force , has become increasingly critical of the CDC , making clear in recent meetings that she is more than frustrated with the agency , according to two senior administration officials . 
Specifically , Birx believes the way the CDC gathers data on the coronavirus is antiquated , causing inaccurate and delayed numbers on both virus cases and deaths . 
Some background : Contamination in manufacturing the CDC test for the coronavirus caused weeks of delays that slowed the US response to the pandemic , multiple health officials told CNN last month , a problem that stemmed in part from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols , according to a US Food and Drug Administration spokesperson . 
The government has never fully explained what stalled the rollout of a crucial test needed to begin measuring the extent of the spread of Covid 19 . 
It would take until the end of February to correct .
