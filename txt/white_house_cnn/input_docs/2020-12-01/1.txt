Democratic Rep . 
Elissa Slotkin called on congressional leadership in both chambers to delay any holiday break for lawmakers until they manage to enact an economic relief package for Americans suffering financially from Covid 19 . 
" When I talk to my peers , my Democratic peers , my Republican peers , we should not be going home for Christmas without a Covid deal , " Slotkin , who represents Michigan 's 8th congressional district , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Monday . 
The final votes for the year in the House are currently scheduled for Dec . 10 , which is the first night of Hanukkah , while the upper chamber is scheduled to begin a state work period on Dec . 21 , which lasts until the end of the year . 
Slotkin also chastised congressional leadership for allowing the election to pass without first securing a relief package . 
" There is blame to go around , " she said , when Blitzer asked if the absence of stimulus package might have cost Democrats seats in the House , which they control . 
"... I think the election and the politics around the election and other things just got in the middle of it . 
I feel strongly ... everyone should have locked themselves in a negotiating room until they got a deal . " 
" People are looking to see that the government can get something done , right ? " she added . 
" . . . I expect the same of my own leadership and leadership in the Senate and then the White House between now and Christmas . "
