The Senate is scheduled to vote on coronavirus funding at 1:45 p.m . ET tomorrow . 
The House passed the $ 8.3 billion coronavirus response package this afternoon in an effort to send billions of dollars to deal with the coronavirus outbreak . 
The measure passed with broad bipartisan support . 
The vote was 415 to 2 with just two Republicans voting against the measure ; 
Andy Biggs , the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus , and Ken Buck . 
The legislation was formally unveiled this afternoon after lawmakers worked to hammer out a package to respond to the outbreak . 
The funding package is far higher than the $ 2.5 billion the White House requested . 
Despite that , however , the White House is expected to back the deal .
