The White House task force on novel coronavirus is looking at how to help Americans who have to stay home from work because they might have coronavirus . 
Dr . Robert Kadlec , assistant secretary for preparedness and response with the US Department of Health and Human Services , said the task force is " looking at ways , in the conversations I 've heard have been about small business , and a very critical part of supporting individuals and how they can do that . " 
" I 'm sure they will welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to figure how and ways to basically support individuals who are facing this problem who are challenged , " he added . 
Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said DHS recognizes the burden that asking employees to stay home imposes both on the business and on the employee – especially for low income workers . 
Cuccinelli said it ’s important for some people to stay home .
