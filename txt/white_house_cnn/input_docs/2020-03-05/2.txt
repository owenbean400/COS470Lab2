In a rare show of bipartisanship , the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to approve a sweeping spending package to direct billions of dollars toward the US government 's response to the coronavirus outbreak as lawmakers scramble to fight the spread of the disease . 
The measure passed by a vote of 96-1 . 
The package will next be sent to the White House for the President 's signature . 
It passed the House on Wednesday with broad , bipartisan support . 
What the legislation says : The agreement provides $ 7.8 billion in appropriations to address the outbreak of coronavirus as well as an authorization for $ 500 million in mandatory spending to fund a telehealth program in an effort to expand access to health services for seniors for a total of $ 8.3 billion in all . 
Lawmakers have been meeting for days to hammer out a package to respond to the coronavirus outbreak . 
The total funding package that will be allocated by the deal is an amount far higher than the $ 2.5 billion White House request . 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $ 8.5 billion to deal with the outbreak . 
Last week , however , the President opened the door to a higher spending level to combat coronavirus than what the White House initially requested , saying , " We 'll spend whatever is appropriate . "
