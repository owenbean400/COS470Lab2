Several dozen US Secret Service officers are either self isolating after contracting coronavirus or are self quarantining after coming into contact with someone who tested positive , a source familiar with the matter tells CNN . 
Even USSS officers are unsure of the numbers because they are not being told an exact number by their superiors , this person said . 
A separate Secret Service source told CNN that he has heard nothing internally about officers testing positive or self quarantining . 
Citing privacy and operational security concerns , a Secret Service spokesperson told CNN that the service will not release how many of its employees have tested positive for coronavirus or how many are , or have been , quarantined . 
There are approximately 7,600 USSS employees , about 1,600 of whom serve as uniformed division officers . 
All employees who worked on the campaign trail are being tested , an official with knowledge of the matter said . 
" The USSS is taking all necessary precautions and putting anyone who is considered close contact in quarantine , " the official said , adding , " There has been zero impact on the mission . 
Staffing levels are high enough to manage . " 
The White House declined to comment to CNN .
