White House negotiators and the staff of Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell spent the weekend working through a series of issues with the broader GOP stimulus proposal , and the expectation is the plan will finally be rolled out Monday afternoon , according to sources and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows . 
That proposal will represent the opening GOP offer , one Democrats have been waiting months for after passing their own $ 3 trillion proposal in the House in May . 
It will include $ 105 billion for schools , another round of direct payments to families and individuals , a second , more targeted round of forgivable small business loans , tax incentives for re hiring and retro fitting workplaces to address coronavirus concerns and broad liability protections for companies , schools , hospitals and non profits . 
Mc Connell planned to release the proposal last week , but administration officials raised a series of technical , and at times , according to people involved , extraneous , issues that delayed the process and dragged talks throughout the weekend . 
The largest holdup has centered on the GOP proposal to address the expiring $ 600 federal unemployment benefit . 
Administration officials and congressional staff have been going back and forth on the technical mechanics of implementing a scaled back version of the benefit for days , all as they attempt to make it equate to roughly 70 % of a worker 's wages , as opposed to the current flat rate .
