White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters he believes Robert O ’Brien ’s daughter was sick before the national security adviser tested positive for Covid 19 himself . 
" I did speak to him Friday . 
I believe his daughter was ill first , he tested several times and I – I have not spoken to him today , so I actually ca not confirm what ’s in the papers , but I ’ll assume it ’s right , " Kudlow said at the White House Monday . 
Kudlow , who has publicly advocated mask wearing but has not been seen wearing a mask himself , was wearing a face covering as he spoke with reporters . 
When asked what changed , Kudlow claimed it was because reporters were wearing them . 
" You know why ? " he said . 
" You all are wearing them . " 
Kudlow continued : " We ’re not going to keep the economy open , we ’re not going to get the v shaped recovery , we ’re not going to get kids back to school , unless we follow simple guidelines : masking , distancing , testing , and personal hygiene . "
