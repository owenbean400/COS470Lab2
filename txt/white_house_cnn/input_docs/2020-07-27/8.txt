Tennessee is poised to see rapid and widespread growth of coronavirus unless the state acts quickly to turn things around , White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx said Monday . 
The spread being seen in Tennessee is more dangerous than the first outbreaks in March and April , Birx said at a news conference in Nashville after meeting with Tennessee Gov . 
Bill Lee . 
Birx said she was visiting Tennessee , like she had visited Indiana , Ohio and Kentucky , because of concerns about the spread of the virus . 
" What has really worried us is this particular wave of the Covid virus is very different than the wave that we experienced in March and April , " she said . 
It ’s not just hitting cities this time , but also the suburbs and rural areas . 
And , as in other places seeing new bursts of infections , the spread is mostly among people under the age of 35 . 
" Many of them were asymptomatic and spread the virus unknowingly to others , " she added . 
Birx said she also spoke with Lee about how important it is for all rural Tennesseans to wear a mask . 
" We 've talked to the governor about the importance of mask mandates . 
I think he has a sound strategy that he 's working through the state , " she said . 
Lee said he would hold firm against a statewide mask mandate . 
" I happen to believe that statewide mandates are not the best strategy , they 're not the best approach , and they do not effectively bring about the wearing of masks as well as other strategies , " he said , adding that " there 's nothing off the table . " 
" I 've also said we 're not going to close the economy back down and we 're not going to . 
But , I appreciate their recommendations and we will , we take them seriously , " Lee said . 
Tennessee added 2,553 new Covid 19 cases on Monday , the state ’s Department of Health said .
