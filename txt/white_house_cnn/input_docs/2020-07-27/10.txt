Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell in remarks on the Senate floor formally announced that Senate Republicans are rolling out their stimulus proposal plan today and that it will be titled the HEALS Act . 
" The American people need more help , " he said , " That is what this Senate majority has assembled , and that is what Chairman Alexander , Blunt , Collins , Graham , Grassley , Rubio and Shelby and Senators Cornyn and Romney are introducing today . 
They ’ll be coming to the floor shortly to introduce their components . 
Together their bills make up the HEALS Act — that ’s Health , Economic Assistance , Liability Protection and Schools . " 
Mc Connell said that the proposal will cut to the heart of three crises facing the country : getting kids back to school , getting workers back to work , and winning the fight against the virus . 
The Senate majority leader said that there will be " another round of direct checks for households at the same amount as before , with even more support for families who care for vulnerable adult dependents . " 
He said that there will be a " sequel " to the Paycheck Protection Program " to help prevent more layoffs of American workers . " 
On unemployment insurance , Mc Connell said , " Republicans want to continue a federal supplement to state unemployment insurance . 
In fact , we ’ll propose a weekly dollar amount that is 8 times what Democrats put in place when they controlled the White House and Congress during the Great Recession . 
But we have to do it in a way that does not slow down re opening . " 
More on this : CNN ’s Phil Mattingly reported earlier today that the Senate Republican relief package will include a cut of $ 400 to the enhanced unemployment benefit for Americans out of work from the Covid 19 crisis . 
On healthcare , Mc Connell said that there will be " strong legal liability protections " included in the plan , a policy he has insisted on , but that Democrats have already pushed back against .
