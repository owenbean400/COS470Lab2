Many states and communities began loosening coronavirus pandemic restrictions in the late spring and early summer â€” but as cases surge across the US , there are calls for a second lockdown . 
More than 150 prominent medical experts , scientists , teachers , nurses and other experts have signed a letter urging leaders to shut the country down and start over to contain the rampant spread of the virus . 
The letter came just after an unpublished document prepared for the White House coronavirus task force recommended that 18 states in the coronavirus " red zone " for cases should roll back reopening measures amid surging cases . 
Those states were Alabama , Arkansas , Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia , Iowa , Idaho , Kansas , Louisiana , Mississippi , North Carolina , Nevada , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas and Utah . 
And Dr . Anthony Fauci said earlier this month that some states reopened too quickly , allowing the coronavirus pandemic to come roaring back , How we got here : Georgia was among the first states to reopen , allowing hair and nail salons , gyms , bowling alleys , tattoo studios and massage therapists to reopen their doors in late April . 
Around the same time , some businesses in Alaska and Oklahoma were allowed to reopen . 
By mid May , all 50 states were at least somewhere along the road to a full reopening . 
But even as more communities loosened their coronavirus restrictions , experts warned that the effects of those reopenings would not be clear for weeks .
