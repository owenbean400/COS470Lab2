A woman who captured the nation 's attention in a blistering speech at the Democratic National Convention late last month , once again held President Trump responsible for her father 's death , and calling on him to resign . 
" In late May ... I was telling my dad , ' look , dad , it 's still not safe , ' " said Kristin Urquiza , speaking of her late father , Mark Urquiza , who she said was a Trump supporter before he died of the virus in June . 
" I could not compete with the lies from the White House and because of that , my father passed away , " she told CNN 's Erin Burnett this evening . 
" It is inexcusable ... 
He trusted him and the President betrayed him and tens of thousand of other people . " 
Urquiza said there was nothing the President or administration could do to right the wrongs of its handling of the pandemic short of vacating the White House .
