President Trump 's reelection campaign wo not be able to hold a rally on Saturday in Nevada as planned . 
The Reno Tahoe Airport Authority has sent a letter to the company that runs the hangar that is set to be the venue for the 5,000 person rally this weekend , saying the event " may not proceed , " citing Nevada ’s restrictions on public gatherings . 
" After reviewing the lease , the airport ’s attorney found the rally would be in violation of Directive 021 from the Nevada Governor , " the airport 's statement said . 
As a result , officials sent a letter to Hanger 9 , LLC , the company that leases the private hanger set to be the venue , saying that they " may not proceed with the proposed gathering , " a copy of the letter provided by the airport shows . 
" We would hold our tenants to the same standard whether it was a Democratic or Republican rally or any other type of gathering , " Griffin added . 
Airport officials were also concerned that the rally would draw demonstrations that could " interfere with or impede the operations of the airport , " the statement said . 
The Trump campaign suggested that the move was political . 
" Democrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters because they know the enthusiasm behind his re election campaign cannot be matched by Joe Biden , " Tim Murtaugh , Trump campaign spokesperson , said in a statement . 
" President Trump will be traveling to Nevada on the dates planned . 
Additional details will be announced soon , " the statement added . 
Nevada Gov . 
Steve Sisolak said in a tweet that his office " had no involvement or communication with the event organizers or potential hosts regarding the proposed campaign events advertised by the Trump campaign . " 
" The Nevada specific White House recommendations have consistently included recommendations to limit the size of gatherings for weeks now , " Sisolak added .
