White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany said during Wednesday ’s press briefing that Astra Zeneca ’s recent pause on a coronavirus vaccine trial showed " science is guiding the way on a vaccine . " 
Mc Enany called their pause " a routine response when you see an adverse effect . " 
Mc Enany also said that an end of year coronavirus vaccine is still the goal , despite the pause , and disputed that there was ever an Election Day deadline . 
" Our timing is not about the election . 
It is about saving lives and by the end of the year has always been our goal , but of course a safe and effective vaccine , we will take it as quickly as we can get it , " she said .
