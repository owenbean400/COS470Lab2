Trump administration officials continued to predict dire , depression era level unemployment numbers for the month of May , days after the April unemployment rate hit 17 % . 
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNN on Sunday that he thinks the United States unemployment rate will " probably " be " close to 20 % " in the May jobs report , noting this number will depend on what happens with the virus and with the economy as some states begin to reopen . 
Hassett said that the middle of the summer will be a " transition phase . " 
He hopes the Congressional Budget Office 's prediction for growth in the third and fourth quarters of the year will be right . 
" If you remember that we basically stopped the greatest economy on Earth to save lives and I think that we 're very glad we 've saved lots of lives . 
We 're very glad that we 've done that , " Hassett said , adding that the CBO 's projection for growth in the second half of the year is not a mystery . 
Larry Kudlow , the chairman of the White House ’s National Economic Council , also acknowledged challenges for May but projected some optimism moving forward . 
Economic rebound : Several of the administration ’s economic advisers also predicted a rebound in the second half of the year . 
Kudlow predicted " 20 percent economic growth " in the last six months of 2020 . 
During an interview on " Fox News Sunday , " Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that the US is likely to have a " very , very bad second quarter " followed by what he predicted would be a " bounce back . "
