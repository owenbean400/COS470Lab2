Secret Service agents who are part of the President ’s protective detail were seen Saturday evening wearing masks in the Cabinet Room . 
There are 11 Secret Service employees who currently have Covid 19 , a congressional source confirmed to CNN . 
Yahoo News , which first reported the figure basing it on a Department of Homeland Security document , also said 60 employees are self quarantining .

" To protect the privacy of our employee ’s health information and for operational security , the Secret Service is not releasing how many of its employees have tested positive for Covid 19 , nor how many of its employees were , or currently are , quarantined , " the spokesperson said .
