White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett admitted " there is no downside " to increased coronavirus testing in the US . 
Where Trump stands on testing : During a meeting last Wednesday with Iowa Gov . 
Kim Reynolds , Trump said , " The media likes to say we have the most cases , but we do , by far , the most testing . 
If we did very little testing , we would not have the most cases . 
So , in a way , by doing all of this testing , we make ourselves look bad . " 
The day before , talking to the press on the South Lawn , Trump said " We have the best testing anywhere in the world , not even close . " 
Trump last month told CNN that the US is " â€¦ giving out millions of tests every day . 
We are doing it exponentially . 
We 're picking up and what we 'll be doing in the very near future will be going to certain areas of our country and do massive testing . "
