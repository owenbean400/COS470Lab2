Robert Redfield , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , " will be teleworking " for the next two weeks after he was exposed to a person at the White House who tested positive for Covid 19 , a CDC spokesman told CNN . 
The Washington Post first reported Redfield 's action . 
Redfield " has been determined to have had a low risk exposure on May 6 to a person at the White House who has Covid 19 . 
He is feeling fine and has no symptoms . 
He will be teleworking for the next two weeks , " the spokesperson said . 
The decision comes after the Food and Drug Administration announced that its commissioner , Dr . Stephen Hahn , planned to self quarantine after coming in contact with an individual who tested positive for coronavirus . 
Neither agencies have named the person or people with whom Redfield and Hahn came into contact . 
Both men are members of the White House coronavirus task force , which held its most recent meeting on Thursday . 
White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere declined to confirm the report that Redfield will self quarantine , but he said the physician to the President and White House operations officials " continue to work closely to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the President , First Family and the entire White House Complex safe and healthy .
