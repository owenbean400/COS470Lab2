The White House sent a memo to all staff on Friday after Vice President Mike Pence 's press secretary , Katie Miller , tested positive for the novel coronavirus , an official said . 
The note details measures taking by the White House to prevent the spread of the virus , including maintaining maximum telework for staff , reporting travel and self monitoring of symptoms , according to a copy reviewed by CNN . 
Areas considered " high touch points " in the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building will receive " heightened levels of cleaning , " the memo says . 
Some departments like the Office of Management and Budget are calling political appointees back to the office despite the maximum telework order . 
Earlier this week , White House staff received a separate memo informing them that they would be asked upon entry about their symptoms . 
The measure would be in addition to the temperature checks required for admission to the White House complex . 
Anyone who acknowledged having the symptoms may be pulled for further screening or barred entry , that memo said . 
Neither memo mentioned anything about wearing face coverings .
