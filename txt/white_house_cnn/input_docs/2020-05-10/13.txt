New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he has reached out to White House officials and sent a letter to the federal government to try to speed up the shipment of remdesivir to the city . 
This comes after the city said the medicine seems to be decreasing the average hospital stay from 15 to 11 days in severely ill Covid 19 patients . 
Some background : The federal government began shipping " tens of thousands " of treatment courses of remdesivir at the beginning of May . 
The federal government is in charge of deciding where the medicine goes , according to Daniel O 'Day , chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences , the maker of the drug .
