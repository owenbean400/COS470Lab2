Vice President Mike Pence is not planning to enter self quarantine after his press secretary tested positive for coronavirus Friday , and he plans to be at the White House on Monday , a Pence spokesman said on Sunday . 
Devin O 'Malley , the vice president 's spokesman , said Pence " will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine . " 
" Additionally , Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow , " O 'Malley said in a statement . 
Separately , an official said Pence ’s schedule will probably be on the lighter side for the next few days but he ’s not doing a full self isolation . 
This official also said there is extreme sensitivity inside the White House now at the current state of affairs -- officials recognize the contradiction in telling states to reopen while the White House enhances protocols to prevent spread of the virus .
