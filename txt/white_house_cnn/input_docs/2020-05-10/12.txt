White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett admitted that working in the West Wing can be risky for his health . 
Hassett told CNN on Sunday he has been tested repeatedly with the last one happening Saturday and so far has tested negative for Covid 19 . 
He said he did not have close contact with Katie Miller , Vice President Mike Pence â€™s press secretary , who tested positive on Friday . 
Several top medical officials of the administration are now self quarantining because they had close contact with her last week . 
Hassett , who had left a job in the White House for the private sector and became a CNN commentator , went back to work for the administration in March . 
He told CNN that when he came back into the administration he was setting up a data operation in the basement of the White House " interacting constantly with people who were going to and from FEMA . " 
He added some people " caught Covid at FEMA . " 
" So we 've all been exposing ourselves to risks , under the best guidance we could possibly have to keep us safe , but we 're willing to take that chance because we love our country . 
There are things that have to happen in the West Wing even if the building is a little old and under ventilated , " he said . 
" I absolutely have a mask in my pocket . 
I could wave it at you right now , and I practice social distancing , I wear a mask when I feel it 's appropriate and so on . "
