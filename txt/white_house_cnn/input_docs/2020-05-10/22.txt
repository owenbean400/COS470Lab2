A key coronavirus model often cited by the White House now predicts more deaths in the US , a shift that a top researcher tied to " explosive increases in mobility in a number of states . " 
The model , from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) at the University of Washington , now forecasts 137,000 deaths in the US by August , up from an earlier prediction of about 134,000 . 
Dr . Christopher Murray , the IHME director , discussed the model on CBS today . 
" We ’re seeing just explosive increases in mobility in a number of states that we expect will translate into more cases and deaths in ten days from now , " Murray said . 
In a press release , Murray said the model is not yet predicting a resurgence or " return to exponential growth " of the epidemic in the US . 
But cell phone data still shows Americans moving more – which suggests more infections to come . 
IHME is also seeing more cases and deaths than expected in certain places , " but it ’s mostly mobility that ’s driving up the numbers . " 
Some of that is the result of relaxed social distancing measures , Murray said . 
" We ’re seeing increases in mobility even in anticipation of the relaxation of social distancing , but there ’s definitely a correlation – the places that are taking off the social distancing mandates , the bump in mobility appears to be larger , " he said . 
Some context : The top five states in terms of increasing mobility , Murray said , are Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Minnesota and Georgia . 
A number of other states have seen a 15-20 % percentage point in mobility , according to an IHME press release : Alabama , Alaska , Idaho , Iowa , Kansas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Ohio , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , Wisconsin and Wyoming . 
While the model only forecasts until August , IHME said later projections will likely extend into October – and will include potential effects of students returning to school .
