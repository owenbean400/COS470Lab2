White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters Wednesday that – as negotiations on a stimulus package continue to fall apart – he does not know that there is any other plan other than " no deal . " 
Meadows emerged from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office this afternoon with a dire assessment of where negotiations stand , saying they made no progress . 
Pelosi rejected the short term unemployment insurance idea and the federal enhancement of unemployment , which will expire at the end of the week . 
Asked what would unlock the current impasse , Meadows said , " I do not know that anything does . " 
More from the Capitol : Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , after meeting with top White House negotiators on the next round of coronavirus relief legislation , explicitly rejected any short term measure to extend the expiring federal unemployment enhancement and attacked Republicans for having no plan to address the issues . 
Schumer , after the third meeting in as many days , said Republicans are " tied in a knot because of the disunity in their caucus , because of their inability to gather votes , because the President says one thing one day and says another thing the other . " 
" They have no coherent plan , they have no comprehensive plan , " Schumer said . 
" They have tried to come up with a ‘ skinny bill ’ that does not address the moment and they ca not even pass that in their own Senate . "
