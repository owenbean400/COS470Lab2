President Trump is set to travel to Florida today , landing squarely in the center of a coronavirus hotspot and taxing the already limited local health resources . 
The President 's first stops will be in Doral , where he will receive a briefing and deliver remarks at the US Southern Command and then motorcade to a church nearby to participate in a roundtable discussion with Venezuelans . 
Following these events , the President will attend a private fundraiser in Hillsboro Beach . 
He is not scheduled to participate in any events related to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Doral , where US Southern Command is located , is just under two miles from the President 's golf club . 
But it is also in Miami Dade County , which is currently experiencing a coronavirus outbreak . 
Officials in the county reported a staggering 33.5 % Covid 19 positivity rate on Thursday , according to data released by Mayor Carlos Gimenez 's office . 
The positivity rate — that is , the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested — is tracked daily by the county . 
Over the past 13 days , hospitalizations in Miami Dade County have gone up by 76 % , the number of ICU beds being used has increased by 86 % and the use of ventilators has soared by 124 % , according to the latest data from the county government . 
A presidential visit — no matter who is in office — requires a significant amount of resources , with White House officials , White House Medical Unit representatives and US Secret Service agents traveling in advance of the president to coordinate with local officials on the ground . 
There is an extensive amount of medical preparation involved each time a president travels , with plans in place for the worst case scenario .
