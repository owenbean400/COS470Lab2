Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation â€™s top infectious disease expert , continues to contradict President Trump on coronavirus , including sharing differing descriptions about the seriousness of the pandemic in the US . 
While President Trump has pushed to reopen schools and downplay the surge of cases , Fauci warned in a Wall Street Journal podcast yesterday that states with resurging coronavirus cases " should seriously look at shutting down . " 
Fauci later noted that states with spiking coronavirus cases still can contain them by pausing their reopening processes , rather than shutting down a second time . 
In an interview published earlier today , Fauci said he 's " trying to figure out " where President Trump got the number behind his claim that 99 % of coronavirus cases were " harmless . " 
On July 4 , Trump sought to downplay the surge in Covid 19 cases by falsely claiming that testing in the US shows 99 % of cases " are totally harmless . " 
Fauci told FT that he last saw Trump on June 2 at the White House , and has not personally briefed him in at least two months . 
Here 's a sampling of how Fauci has contradicted the President 's misinformation on camera :
