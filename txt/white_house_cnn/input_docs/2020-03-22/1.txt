House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sounded an ominous warning Sunday that she may not support an emerging coronavirus economic stimulus bill that had been on a fast track through the Congress this weekend . 
Pelosi spoke as she arrived at a critical meeting of the top four congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to finalize the bill , which has been the subject of intense negotiations on the Senate side for days . 
The Senate did consider input from Pelosi and House committees who worked through Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to provide it . 
On Saturday , Schumer signaled he might accept the bill . 
But on Sunday morning , Democratic sources said they had uncovered numerous problems with provisions dealing with aid to workers and loan assistance to businesses . 
What could happen next : If Pelosi does not support the bill , Senate Democrats could stall action on the bill by blocking a procedural motion set for a vote Sunday afternoon . 
The House Speaker also could change it when the bill goes to the House if it passes the Senate Monday , as Senate Republicans and the White House want . 
That could slow getting out the much needed aid to workers and businesses . 
Pressure would mount — from Wall Street to Main Street — on Pelosi and House Democrats if they do not act quickly .
