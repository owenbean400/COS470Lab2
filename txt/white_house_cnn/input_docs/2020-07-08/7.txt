White House press secretary Kayleigh Mc Enany told CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins that President Trump and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are " very much " on the same page — despite Trump tweeting : " I disagree with the CDC . " 
" I would note that the CDC is very much on the same page as the President — which is why you heard the CDC director today underscore these are not prescriptive , these are not requirements and that there will be supplemental guidelines . 
So they ’re on the same page , " Mc Enany said Wednesday . 
Trump tweeted seven hours earlier : " I disagree with @ CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools . 
While they want them open , they are asking school to do very impractical things . 
I will be meeting with them ! ! ! " 
Collins also asked Mc Enany why the President wo not attend task force meetings so he can talk about guidelines and other issues . 
" ( Trump ) is routinely briefed about the coronavirus each and every day that relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions and then he moves forward in the way that ’s best for our country , " Mc Enany responded . 
CNN has reported that Trump has not attended a coronavirus task force meeting since April .
