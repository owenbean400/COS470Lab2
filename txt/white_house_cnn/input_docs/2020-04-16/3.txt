On a call with the nation ’s governors today , state officials were given a packet outlining proposed measures for reopening the economy in three phases , according to state officials and a GOP source . 
The packet also outlines the " Proposed state or regional gating criteria " for each phase . 
It includes when to reopen restaurants , bars , gyms and public spaces and gives guidance for employers , as well as phasing in nonessential travel . 
According to one state official , it was a much more conservative and reasonable approach than they thought would come out of today ’s call . 
The new federal guidelines dictate when states should begin a phased reopening of certain businesses , including a sustained decrease in cases over a 14 day period and a return to pre crisis conditions in hospitals . 
States should have the " ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites , " the guidelines read , and " quickly and independent supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment " in hospitals . 
The phased approach encourages all individuals to continue good hygiene practices like washing hands and " strongly consider " using face coverings in public . 
The document encourages employers to enact social distancing , temperature checks , testing and sanitation practices . 
In the first phase of reopening , the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so . 
Large venues can operate under strict social distancing protocols . 
Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines , but bars should remain shuttered .
