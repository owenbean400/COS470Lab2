The UK will likely have to maintain social distancing until a coronavirus vaccine is available , said epidemiologist Neil Ferguson in an interview with the BBC on Thursday . 
Ferguson is a professor at Imperial College London who advises the British government on its coronavirus response . 
" We have relatively little leeway , if we relax measures too much then we 'll see a resurgence of transmission . " 
What others are saying : Ferguson 's words mirror what researchers in the United States have also projected . 
The US may have to endure social distancing measures -- such as stay at home orders and school closures -- until 2022 , according to researchers from the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health , who published their findings in the journal Science on Tuesday . 
That is , unless a vaccine or better therapeutics become available , or we increase our critical care capacity . 
In other words , 2022 is one scenario of many . 
But those findings directly contradict research being touted by the White House that suggests the pandemic may stop this summer .
