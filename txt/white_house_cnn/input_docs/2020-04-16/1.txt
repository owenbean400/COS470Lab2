The White House is calling on Congress to " IMMEDIATELY increase funding for the Paycheck Protection Program , " according to a tweet sent Thursday morning following news that the $ 349 billion in emergency funding for small businesses had been depleted . 
The tweet says a one page bill will get the job done and there should not be any " liberal pet projects . " 
The tweet concludes by saying that " the Trump Administration is doing its part to get it to them . 
Why is not Congress ? " 
Some context : CNN has reported that the Small Business Association is out of money for the Paycheck Protection Program as of this morning . 
Negotiations on Capitol Hill have yet to generate a path forward to replenish the money , as the US economy continues to stagger under the pressure of near nationwide closures . 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Democrats will reconvene Thursday to try and reach agreement on a package that will immediately increase funding for the program .
