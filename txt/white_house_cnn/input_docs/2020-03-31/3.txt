Dr . Anthony Fauci , a key member of the White House 's coronavirus task force , said the US could see a " second wave " of coronavirus — but he insisted " we will be much , much better prepared " for that possible outbreak . 
" If we do have a second wave — which as I 've mentioned publicly , I think there 's a reasonably good chance we will given the pervasiveness of this infection and its transmissibility — I do not think at all it will be as bad because we have several things in our favor , " he told CNN . 
Fauci said the US will be more prepared and have better equipment . 
Drugs that are in clinical trials could also be available during a possible second wave , and a vaccine could be developed , he said .
