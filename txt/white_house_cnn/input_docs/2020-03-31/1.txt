The White House is expected to reissue federal coronavirus guidelines sometime today , which may feature some slight adjustments , according to an administration official . 
Trump announced Sunday that he would extend the federal guidelines another month . 
There 's been an internal debate over whether to ease up on the social distancing efforts , and some aides recommended the President only extend them another 15 days . 
However , health advisers argued that a month was necessary . 
Trump told aides it would be better to ease the guidelines earlier than expected rather than have to extend them yet again . 
The bleak images from Elmhurst Hospital played a major role in Trump 's decision to keep the guidelines in place . 
Two officials said polling that showed the public largely favored keeping the guidelines intact also played a role . 
Some officials do not trust the models the President is being shown . 
This is a pretty prevalent line of thinking inside the West Wing . 
Several aides have dismissed them , believing they are overblown and that past projections have been wrong . 
Officials from the task force are expected to preview those models at some point today , though it 's not clear when or how yet .
