Although the US has began rolling out the coronavirus vaccine , Americans still need to wear masks and take other safety measures , White House coronavirus testing czar Admiral Brett Giroir said Wednesday . 
While urging people to observe these safety measures and listed to public health messages , he emphasized that the US is " still at a dangerous and critical part of this pandemic and tens of thousands of American lives are at stake . " 
The current vaccine rollout will create an impact on the number of new Covid 19 cases , hospitalizations and deaths in the US . 
This will be seen " almost immediately , " Giroir said , but cautioned that widespread immunity through vaccination will not come until the late spring or early summer . 
Meanwhile , the White House testing czar is hoping to increase testing availability in the country . 
" You 're going to hear more good news from the FDA very soon about other home tests that are not exactly the over the counter type , but are in the same ballpark , " he said . 
" You 'll see more and more tests get authorized , and them ramping up very soon , in the early part of the year . "
