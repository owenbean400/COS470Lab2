Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , says he hopes the US Food and Drug Administration will authorize Moderna â€™s Covid 19 vaccine for emergency use authorization ( EUA ) this week after it was confirmed to have 94.5 % efficacy against the virus . 
An advisory committee to the FDA released data in a briefing document on Tuesday morning that confirmed the vaccine has a " favorable " safety profile . 
The document will be discussed in a meeting this Thursday , during which the FDA 's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will review and provide recommendations on whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks for use in adults age 18 and older . 
Once approved , Slaoui said the shipment could start 24 hours later . 
More than 6 million doses of vaccines will be shipped to more than 3,200 sites , he added . 
" We 're ramping up to distribute more vaccines . "
