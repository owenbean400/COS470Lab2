White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday that he does not think the prospect on another round of coronavirus relief is dead " at all " and that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin " may " offer a proposal priced higher than Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's most recent offer of $ 2.2 trillion . 
" Secretary Mnuchin is up to 1.8 trillion . 
So the bid and the offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides . 
President Trump actually has always said — I mean , I 've heard him say it in the oval — as far as the key elements are concerned , the checks , the unemployment assistance , the small business assistance , we 've got to help airlines out , he would go further . 
He 's always said that , " Kudlow said . 
Kudlow said he spoke with Mnuchin last night on the matter . 
He noted that the Republican asked for targeted relief measures , including more federal unemployment assistance and another round of PPP loans and direct stimulus checks to individuals . 
More context : On Saturday , Senate Republicans blasted a $ 1.8 trillion offer from the White House on a call with Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows . 
While the sentiment was that talks with Pelosi should continue , it was clear that the White House plan had virtually no chance of passing the Senate , per multiple sources . 
Asked about the Republican pushback , Kudlow demurred , saying " I do not know who we have lost " and noting the previous Republican efforts on a pared down bill . 
" Let 's see what happens . 
I 'm not negotiating today , " Kudlow said . 
This also comes after President Trump did an about face on the negotiations this week , first , unilaterally putting a stop to the talks ahead of the election and then signing off on a $ 1.8 trillion proposal by Friday . 
Kudlow reiterated his belief that economic recovery is not dependent on the passage of another stimulus bill .
