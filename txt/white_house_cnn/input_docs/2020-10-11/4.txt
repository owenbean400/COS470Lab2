President Trump claimed , without evidence , that he is " immune " from Covid 19 following his apparent recovery from the virus , and he defended his decision to deliver a speech to a crowd at the White House on Saturday less than a week after leaving the hospital . 
" It seems like I ’m immune , " Trump said on Fox . 
Trump said he believes he will be immune for " maybe a long time , maybe a short time , could be a lifetime , " noting it ’s unclear how much immunity previously infected individuals can expect after recovering . 
Some context : There is no evidence that people are immune if they have been infected once and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically cautions people not to assume they are immune . 
Trump said his medical team informed him he was " free " of Covid 19 before he gave his speech on Saturday . 
" Even yesterday , I knew I was free , " the President added . 
Trump said he is " in very good shape " to move forward . 
He is scheduled to travel to Florida on Monday for a campaign rally .
