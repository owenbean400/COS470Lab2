Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf , a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce , emphasized the need for mitigation to combat the pandemic in the US . 
Wolf , speaking to the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee on Wednesday , said he wanted to " emphasize some very basic things , and that is mitigation works , so we 're not going to test our way out of this . " 
He added that washing your hands , not touching your face and ensuring social distancing are key . 
Wolf said the department is urging the preservation of personal protection equipment so that doctors hospitals and nursing homes can make them last longer than that one time . 
He also said the department is working to accelerate supplies to meet demand , touting the use of Federal Emergency Management Agency 's Air Bridge . 
Some context : As of April 14 , there were about 44 flights with another 56 that are scheduled , he said . 
DHS is working with about five or six medical distributors , whose PPE is already destined for the US . 
" What we 're trying to do is we 're trying to get it here quicker . 
And then we 're trying to make sure that we allocate it to those hotspots , as well as their traditional supply chain , " he said . 
Wolf said DHS is also involved in domestic efforts to alter supply lines and shift to mask and other personal protective equipment production , as well as proper allocation of supplies . 
He said that companies have given the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Defense unprecedented insight into their supply chains .
