People might be most infectious with the novel coronavirus before they show symptoms , according to a study published Wednesday . 
The research , published in the journal Nature Medicine , adds to a growing body of evidence showing that seemingly healthy people are spreading the virus . 
They found that viral shedding – when people may be able to infect others – could begin two to three days before symptoms appeared . 
The amount of virus given off , though , appeared to decline after people began feeling sick . 
Researchers warned that people may be spreading the virus before they show symptoms , public health interventions – such as contact tracing – will need to be adjusted . 
Not only will investigators need to identify those who were exposed to symptomatic people , but they may also need to look retroactively – tracing contacts from when people still felt healthy . 
" More inclusive criteria for contact tracing to capture potential transmission events 2 to 3 days before symptom onset should be urgently considered for effective control of the outbreak , " the researchers wrote . 
More details : The study did have limitations . 
Namely , it relied on patients ’ memories of when their symptoms first appeared , which could have been fuzzy . 
Still , the research is consistent with other findings , which suggest that people who do not feel sick are in fact contributing to the spread of the virus . 
Based on that growing body of evidence , the White House has recommended that healthy people wear face coverings outside to reduce the risk of infecting others .
