The White House and congressional Democrats are discussing adding tens of billions of dollars for hospitals as part of a small business package stalled in Congress , a source involved in the talks said Saturday . 
One area of discussion is $ 75 billion for hospitals as part of the measure , the source said . 
An agreement on hospital funding could make it easier for the two sides to reach a deal after $ 250 billion in additional money for the small business program remains stalled in Congress amid Democratic demands to extend funding to other entities affected by the crisis . 
Republicans are hopeful they could see a deal by Monday , but there is a caveat , one Republican close to the negotiations told CNN . 
It only takes one member of either chamber to object to stop any deal from going forward .
