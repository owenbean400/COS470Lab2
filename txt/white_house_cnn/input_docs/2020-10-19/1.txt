House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin must reach an agreement within 48 hours if they want to pass a coronavirus stimulus relief bill before Election Day . 
Pelosi is putting pressure on the administration to cut a deal by Tuesday because the legislative process in the House and Senate will take time to play out , and it wo not be feasible to get a bill passed through both chambers by November 3 if the talks drag on beyond the next couple days . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell announced on Saturday there would be votes on stimulus measures , including a stand alone Paycheck Protection Program bill to help small businesses , on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
But Democrats , who are expected to block Mc Connell 's effort , have been pushing for a larger deal , banking on on again , off again talks that Pelosi has had with Mnuchin for months . 
Pelosi 's office told CNN Sunday that the 48 hours refers to the end of the day on Tuesday and that they need answers to key outstanding questions by then or they wo not be able to get a bill passed before the election . 
Negotiations would still continue after Tuesday if a deal is not reached , but it would not get done in time before Election Day . 
The California Democrat also said during the interview with ABC the White House has watered down language Democrats have been pushing to create a national plan for Covid 19 testing and contact tracing . 
She also noted that the Trump administration had changed much of the language on testing and tracing after the two sides seemingly came to an agreement last week .
