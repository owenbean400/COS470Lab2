Dr . Chris Murray , a researcher behind an influential coronavirus model from the University of Washington , said Monday that the Covid 19 pandemic is " far from over . " 
Murray cited new survey data on mask usage that shows " on average in the US , about 40 % of Americans say in surveys that they wear a mask all the time . 
Eighty percent say they wear a mask some of the time or all of the time . " 
Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said Sunday that there is " clear scientific evidence " that masks work to mitigate the spread of the virus . 
The researcher said he believed that social distancing and mask usage were factors for why the Covid 19 crisis was " not as bad as it could have been . " 
" We really think that 's because of mask use and people being more cautious , " Murray said . 
" But of course , the images this [ Memorial ] weekend make you wonder if people are starting to forget about that caution . "
