The premier of Australia 's Victoria state is calling on residents to remain vigilant as the state eases coronavirus restrictions . 
Victoria reported no new Covid 19 cases and deaths for the second consecutive day on Tuesday . 
" It 's based on where we 've come from and where we are now , and the fact that there 's always more virus out there than you know . 
Because not everybody gets tested . 
And not everybody who does get tested gets tested as quickly as they should , " Andrews added . 
Tuesday is the first time since March 5 and 6 that the state has reported no new cases for two days in a row , the premier said . 
" Masks are an important part of this now . 
They wo not be there forever . 
They are uncomfortable . 
It 's not a permanent setting , but it will be there for so long as the health team are really clear with us that this does play a role , " Andrews said . 
People in Melbourne will be allowed to leave their homes but will be restricted to a 25 kilometer ( 15 mile ) limit and only visiting other households once per day . 
Two adults can visit another home with children as dependents , Andrews added .
