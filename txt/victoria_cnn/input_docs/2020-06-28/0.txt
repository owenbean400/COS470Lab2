All those returning to the Australian state of Victoria will need to test negative for coronavirus before being released from quarantine , says Victoria premier Daniel Andrews . 
Victoria is the only state in Australia that has been testing returned travelers twice â€“ on day three and day 11 . 
Starting Sunday , the day 11 test will become mandatory and those who refuse to comply will be required to remain in quarantine for another 10 days . 
Andrews also said that some suburbs could be put under a stay at home order or some sort of lockdown , if needed . 
The background : Victoria has seen a spike in cases over the past two weeks . 
Last Friday , the state said it would launch a targeted testing program , allowing residents in 10 suburbs to receive free testing for the next 10 days . 
In total , 40,000 tests have been conducted since the program was launched . 
Andrews said the current situation is " much like a bushfire . "
