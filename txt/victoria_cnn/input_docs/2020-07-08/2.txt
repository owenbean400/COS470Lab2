As Australia has shut the border between its two most populous states to contain the spread of the coronavirus , tens of thousands of people living close to the dividing line have found their community cleaved in two . 
Located on each side of the Murray river that separates New South Wales ( NSW ) and Victoria , the twin cities of Albury and Wodonga , more commonly referred to as Albury Wodonga , have long operated as one community and one economy . 
Many of their 100,000 residents cross the border to travel to work and school every day . 
Businesses run on both sides of the river . 
The two cities even share the same hospital , located in Albury on the NSW side but covered by Victoria 's health system . 
But that border was sealed on Wednesday , as authorities scrambled to prevent a second wave of infections spreading across the country . 
Over the past few weeks , Victoria has struggled to contain a sudden reemergence of coronavirus in Melbourne , as case numbers have continued to rise . 
Authorities blocked major roads between Victoria and NSW after midnight -- the first time in 100 years since the border was last closed during the Spanish flu pandemic . 
People from Victoria are banned from entering NSW , but exemptions are made for some purposes and professions , including cross border residents in settlements like Albury Wodonga . 
Online applications for cross border permits started on Tuesday night , but the website crashed just 45 minutes after launching as 44,000 people applied , according to Australian national broadcaster ABC .
