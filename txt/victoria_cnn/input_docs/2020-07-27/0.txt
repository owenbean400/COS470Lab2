The Australian state of Victoria recorded 532 new coronavirus cases on Sunday , marking the nation 's worst day of the pandemic so far , said Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday . 
Victoria also recorded six fatalities in the past day , raising the state 's death toll to 77 and the national death toll to 161 . 
Three weeks of lockdown : Victoria has seen high case numbers persist for weeks , despite metropolitan Melbourne and neighboring Mitchell Shire being halfway through a six week long lockdown order . 
The major driver of these new cases is people going to work while sick , said Andrews . 
Aged care facility outbreak : There are also outbreaks across multiple aged care facilities , with 683 residents and staff testing positive so far . 
" The residents in these facilities will be people , parents , grandparents , great grandparents , and they are at significant risk of dying -- that is an inescapable fact , " said Victoria â€™s Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton on Monday .
