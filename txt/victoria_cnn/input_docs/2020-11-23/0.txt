Australia reopened travel between New South Wales state and the former virus hotspot of Victoria on Monday , after four months of closed interstate borders . 
Flights between Sydney and Melbourne , once the busiest flight route in the country and second busiest in the world , also resumed on Monday . 
Qantas and Jetstar will operate 17 flights between Sydney and Melbourne on Monday alone according to Qantas . 
Why the border shut : The border between NSW and Victoria was closed on July 8 , when Victoria saw a large spike in coronavirus cases . 
The country 's largest outbreak so far peaked in July and August , and cases have slowly fallen back to single and double digits per day . 
Both New South Wales and Victoria recorded no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Sunday . 
The reopening of the border comes after Victoria further relaxed restrictions , including allowing the number of people attending outdoor gatherings in public places to 50 people . 
Cinemas , galleries and museums will be allowed to host up to 150 people indoors .
