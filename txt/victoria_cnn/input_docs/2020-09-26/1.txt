Victoria 's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos has resigned in the wake of Premier Daniel Andrews ’ testimony to the state ’s hotel quarantine inquiry , in which he said she was responsible for the bungled scheme that resulted in a devastating second wave of the virus in the state . 
In a statement posted on Twitter , Mikakos said she had written to Victoria ’s Governor to resign as minister and will also be resigning from Parliament . 
On Friday , Andrews said that Mikakos was responsible for the hotel quarantine program , but said he does know who made the decision to use private security contractors to manage the hotel quarantine system . 
Mikakos said on Saturday she took responsibility for the department , but said it was not her responsibility alone . 
The Board of Inquiry has heard evidence that Victoria ’s second wave was started by leaks from the hotel quarantine scheme . 
Friday was the last day of hearings for Victoria ’s inquiry into the failure of the hotel quarantine program . 
The Board of Inquiry ’s final report is due on November 6 .
