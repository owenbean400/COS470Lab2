Australia ’s state of Victoria will ban visitors from parts of Sydney starting Saturday and institute travel permits for those coming from the state of New South Wales ( NSW ) , where a cluster of Covid 19 cases is raising concern . 
On Friday , New South Wales reported that the cluster stemming from Sydney ’s Northern Beaches area stood at 28 cases . 
Victoria is also encouraging travelers from other parts of Greater Sydney to get tested on arrival and self quarantine until they receive a negative result . 
The state government says it is working with airlines to check for permits and will have public health teams meet incoming flights from NSW . 
" The Department of Health and Human Services will look to set up testing sites at the domestic terminal in the coming days , " the government statement read . 
Police are also expected to start patrolling land borders .
