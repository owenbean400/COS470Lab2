The 2021 Australian Open tennis tournament scheduled to begin on January 18 will " likely " be postponed for up to two weeks , according to the Victoria state government on Wednesday . 
The annual Australian Open , the first Grand Slam tennis event of the year , is traditionally held in the last two weeks of January at Melbourne Park in Melbourne , capital of Victoria state . 
Tennis Australia says it has been in " urgent talks " with the state government regarding the quarantining and biosecurity arrangements needed for the tournament to go ahead . 
Pakula on Wednesday flagged an " extremely rigorous testing regime , that will apply to the tennis players , both before they leave the port that they 're coming from and when they arrive . 
And then I imagine consistently through the time they 're in the bubble . " 
While a second wave of Covid 19 forced Melbourne into a strict 112 day lockdown over the southern hemisphere winter , the majority of restrictions have now been eased . 
There has not been a new case of Covid 19 in Victoria since Oct . 29 .
