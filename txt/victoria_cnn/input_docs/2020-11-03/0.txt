The Australian state of Victoria has recorded its fourth day in a row with zero cases , according to the state 's Department of Health and Human Services , bringing the week long daily average of new infections to just 1.9 . 
It 's a stark contrast to the situation in Victoria -- and its capital city Melbourne -- just a few months ago , when more than 700 people a day were being diagnosed with the virus in a rapidly spreading local epidemic . 
But after a strict lockdown which saw a nightly curfew put in place and limits on public gatherings , the number of new infections plunged . 
Restrictions in Melbourne have now been relaxed . 
On Saturday , Australia registered its first day with no coronavirus cases anywhere in the country since June . 
In tweeting his thanks to all Australians for working to bring down the infection rate , Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned the threat was not over yet . 
" We 've seen here , and are seeing again overseas , how quickly this virus spreads , so please stay COVIDSafe , " he said on his official Twitter .
