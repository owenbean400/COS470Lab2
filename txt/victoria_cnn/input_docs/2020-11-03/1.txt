Police in the Australian state of Victoria arrested 404 people who participated in a protest against lockdowns in Melbourne on Tuesday -- more than a week after the state began lifting stringent anti epidemic measures that had been in place for months . 
Protesters occupied the state capital 's central business district and called the virus , which has killed 907 Australians and more than 1.2 million people worldwide , a hoax . 
In footage tweeted by CNN affiliate 9 News Melbourne , some shouted : " Shame on you , fake news ! " at journalists and called for state Premier Daniel Andrews to step down . 
The video also showed police deploying what appeared to be pepper spray at the crowd . 
Melbourne was the epicenter of Australia 's coronavirus epidemic this summer , with Andrews declaring a " state of disaster " at one stage to stem an outbreak that saw as many as 725 people in Victoria test positive for the virus in a single day . 
As cases began skyrocketing , Andrews enacted the type of strict anti epidemic measures that critics worry could damage the economy and trample on civil liberties . 
But from a public health standpoint , Andrews ' decision appeared to have worked . 
While cases in Europe and the United States are surging , on Sunday Australia did not register a single new Covid 19 infection for the first time since June . 
Tuesday saw Victoria report no new cases for the fourth day in a row . 
A new normal : Andrews ' government began relaxing anti epidemic measures last week . 
Melbourne residents can now leave their homes , and most businesses in the state can reopen . 
Some restrictions remain in place , however , including a 25 kilometer ( 15 mile ) limit on travel and an internal border between Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne . 
Public gatherings are limited to 10 people .
