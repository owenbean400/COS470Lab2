The Australian state of Victoria reported 672 new coronavirus cases and eight deaths on Friday , according to the state 's premier Daniel Andrews . 
The total number of infections in Victoria , the second most populous state in Australia , now stands at 10,577 , with 112 deaths , according to Andrews . 
Door knocking campaign : Andrews said he has no announcements to make about harsher lockdowns but he would not rule out more frequent door knocking to check if people are staying at home . 
More than 130 people -- one in four of those who ’ve tested positive -- were caught defying stay at home orders , according to the Premier . 
Authorities have increased manpower to crack down on isolation dodgers , with 34 teams of officers deployed to knock on the doors of infected individuals . 
" Both public health experts from the Victorian team and those on a national level will spend the next day or two looking at the data at the six week point , the halfway point of the stay at home orders that we put in place , " Andrews said . 
" That analysis will happen today and tomorrow , and then we 'll have more to say . " 
Though Friday ’s figures are slightly lower than the previous day , Andrew said that it is " almost impossible " to see Victoria ’s economy open up any time soon .
