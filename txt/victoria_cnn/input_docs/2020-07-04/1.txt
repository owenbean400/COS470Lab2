Following a spike in coronavirus cases in Melbourne , Australia — and a " hard lockdown " of more than 3,000 people in public housing towers — the Australian Medical Association has called for a pause in easing Covid 19 restrictions until clear evidence shows the outbreaks in Melbourne are under control . 
Association President Dr . Tony Bartone said the new outbreaks are a stark reminder the fight against coronavirus is far from over , according to a press release from the association . 
Coronavirus cases have been rising sharply across the state of Victoria for nearly 3 weeks . 
Bartone said the outbreaks were " directly linked to failures to follow established and successful public health guidelines " and that Australia should play it safe before " rushing back to the pub , the footy crowds , or the big weddings and parties . "
