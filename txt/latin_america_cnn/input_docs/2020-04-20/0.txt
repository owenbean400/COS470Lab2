Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro joined a rally in the country 's capital on Sunday , where protesters called for an end to quarantine measures and some urged military intervention to shut down Congress and the Supreme Court . 
Congress and the Supreme Court have supported social isolation measures imposed by governors . 
The President did not wear a mask and coughed several times while speaking to the crowd of a couple of hundred supporters in Brasilia . 
The rules in Brazil : National and local governments in the country have issued mixed messaging on how to behave during the pandemic . 
While Bolsonaro has been pushing against strict restrictions , state and local governments in some of Brazil 's hardest hit areas have closed schools and all but essential businesses , with firefighters and police in the streets urging people to stay indoors . 
Last week , Bolsonaro fired his health minister after weeks of clashes over social isolation measures . 
During a news conference to introduce his new minister , he reiterated that businesses need to be reopened to ensure that the economic fallout is not worse than the virus . 
Polls , however , show that a majority of Brazilians support social isolation . 
On Sunday , Bolsonaro 's supporters also organized caravans in different cities . 
The background : Brazil has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in Latin America . 
As of Sunday , the country had reported 38,654 cases and 2,462 deaths , according to health officials .
