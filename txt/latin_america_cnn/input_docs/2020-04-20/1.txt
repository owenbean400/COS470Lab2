Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro defended his participation in a weekend rally , where protesters called for an end to quarantine measures and urged military intervention to shut down Congress and the Supreme Court . 
Bolsonaro told reporters Monday he personally did not call for shutting down any branch of the government , adding that Brazil is a democracy and referring to the Supreme Court and Congress as " open and transparent . " 
He also lashed out at the media , saying he will not " accept provocations by the press . " 
National and local governments in Brazil have issued mixed messages on how to behave during the pandemic . 
While Bolsonaro has been pushing against strict restrictions , state and local governments in some of the country 's hardest hit areas have closed schools and nonessential businesses , with firefighters and police in the streets urging people to stay indoors . 
Brazil has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in Latin America . 
As of Sunday , Brazil reported 38,654 cases and 2,462 deaths , according to health officials .
