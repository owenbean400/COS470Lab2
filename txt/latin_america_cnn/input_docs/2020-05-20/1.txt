US President Donald Trump said today that he is considering a travel ban on Latin America and called the high number of US Covid 19 cases a " badge of honor " because it means the country is testing more people . 
" We are considering it , " the President said when asked if he was considering a travel ban on Latin America , and Brazil in particular , which now has the third highest number of diagnosed coronavirus cases in the world . 
" We hope that we ’re not going to have a problem . 
The governor of Florida is doing very , very well testing -- in particular Florida , because a big majority come in to Florida . 
Brazil has gone more or less herd , and they ’re having problems , " Trump added . 
" By the way , " the President interjected , " when you say that we lead in cases , that ’s because we have more testing than anybody else . " 
" Actually the number of cases , and we ’re also a much bigger country than most , so when we have a lot of cases , I do not look at that as a bad thing , I look at that as , in a certain respect , as a good thing , because it means our testing is better , " he said .
