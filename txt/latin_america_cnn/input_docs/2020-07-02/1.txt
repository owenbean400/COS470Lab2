Latin America and the Caribbean could see a historic record number of unemployment as a result of the coronavirus pandemic , the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) warned in a new report published Wednesday . 
Before the pandemic hit Latin America and the Caribbean , the unemployment rate in the region was 8.1 % , or about 26 million people at the end of 2019 , according to ILO . 
ILO ’s latest report analyzes data from the World Bank , which estimates a 7.2 % drop in the region ’s economic growth – leading to an 12.3 % unemployment rate . 
The ILO also analyzed the latest numbers from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , which estimate an economic contraction of 9.4 % , resulting in a 13 % unemployment rate . 
" In absolute numbers , these rates imply an increase in the number of people who are looking for a job and do not get it ; from 26 million before the pandemic to 41 million in 2020 , " ILO specialists explained during a virtual news conference on Wednesday . 
ILO ’s report says the majority of the workers in various economic sectors are now at a high risk of unemployment due to the pandemic . 
About 40 % of people with a high risk of unemployment work in high risk economic sectors such as hospitality , food service , small businesses and manual labor , another 17 % are in the medium to high risk sectors , and only 20 % of the labor force is engaged in low risk economic activities such as those in government , education and health jobs .
