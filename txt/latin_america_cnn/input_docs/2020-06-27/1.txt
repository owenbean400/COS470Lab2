Ten days after announcing he had coronavirus , Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández participated in a Zoom conference call with health officials on Friday to discuss the country 's Covid 19 response . 
Although other people on the conference call were streaming video , Hernández could not be seen in person ; instead his official portrait was shown on the screen . 
It was not immediately clear where he was calling from and whether he was still in the hospital where he has been receiving treatment . 
" I started having symptoms and thought it was something else and lost three to four important days of treatment . 
I thought it was something similar . 
But , I am the proof that it is necessary to be precise in going to the doctor , tell him the symptoms and make the doctor attend us . 
That 's clear . 
It 's urgent to be attended to as faster as possible . " 
Hernández is the first president in Latin America to have tested positive for the virus . 
According to the President 's verified Twitter page , the leader had been on the mend since Wednesday .
