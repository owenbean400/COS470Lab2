The number of coronavirus cases reported in Ecuador nearly doubled Thursday , from 11,183 to 22,160 , according to the country ’s health minister . 
The sharp increase was not caused by a new outbreak , Health Minister Juan Carlos Zevallos said during a news conference Thursday . 
Zevallos said it was due to a backlog of tests in the country ’s laboratories , which left thousands of tests unprocessed . 
Ecuador is one of the countries that has been hit hardest by coronavirus in Latin America . 
The country has the second highest number of cases behind Brazil , where more than 49,000 cases have been confirmed and 3,313 deaths .
