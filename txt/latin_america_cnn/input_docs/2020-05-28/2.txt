The mayor of Sao Paulo announced new guidelines on Thursday to gradually reopen the city , despite high levels of infections and deaths related to Covid 19 . 
Mayor Bruno Covas said during a news conference today that several sectors in the city will be allowed to submit health and sanitary reopening plans to officials starting on Monday . 
Once these plans are approved by the city government , they can reopen . 
Among the businesses allowed to submit reopening plans are offices , retail stores , car dealerships , real estate agencies and shopping malls . 
Food courts and gyms are excluded . 
There is no outlook yet for the reopening of schools or parks . 
Remember : Earlier this week a World Health Organization official warned Latin America is the new epicenter of the pandemic and cases are accelerating in Brazil . 
Brazil surpassed Russia over the weekend in the number of coronavirus infections and is now the second highest in the world , with more than 400,000 cases . 
Currently ICU beds in Sao Paulo are at a 92 % occupancy , the mayor said on Thursday . 
He added more ICU beds have been brought in and more are on their way , but the number of ICU bed occupied is slightly higher than it was two weeks ago . Covas and Joao Doria , the governor of the state of Sao Paulo , have implemented a series of measures over the last couple of weeks aimed at slowing the spread of the virus and promoting social isolation . 
Doria gave several municipalities in Sao Paulo state the green light to begin partial reopenings , including the capital city on Wednesday . 
Specialists say the move is risky . 
On Wednesday , Sao Paulo reported 129 new deaths and 3,096 new confirmed cases , which accounts for 15 % of all the new cases in Brazil . 
The city has recorded a total number of 54,948 Covid 19 cases .
