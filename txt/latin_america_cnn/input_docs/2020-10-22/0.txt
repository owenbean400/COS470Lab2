Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello has tested positive for Covid 19 and is isolating at home , Brazil 's Health Ministry said on Wednesday . 
Pazuello , an army general , is the third health minister appointed by President Jair Bolsonaro after the first two were squeezed out after clashing with the President over how to tackle the pandemic . 
Pazuello has stood behind Bolsonaro â€™s views . 
Dozens of cabinet members and elected officials -- including Bolsonaro himself -- have tested positive for Covid 19 since the virus was first detected in Brazil in March . 
Pazuello had a fever earlier in the week , according to the ministry , and canceled an in person meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday . 
He participated in a virtual meeting with governors from the Brasilia hotel where he lives . 
Devastating toll : No country in Latin America has been hit harder by the pandemic than Brazil . 
More than 5.2 million Brazilians have been infected and at least 154,000 have died -- the world 's third highest number of confirmed cases and second highest death toll , respectively . 
Bolsonaro has been widely criticized abroad for his response to the pandemic . 
He has repeatedly insisted that hunger and unemployment caused by social isolation measures could be more harmful than the virus . 
He has also been a major proponent of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine , although it has not proven effective combating Covid 19 .
