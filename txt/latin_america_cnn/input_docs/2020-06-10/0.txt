The Trump administration is closely monitoring the impact coronavirus is having on economies in Latin America , Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said Wednesday . 
" We are worried about Covid 19 south of the border , all the way to South America , " Cuccinelli said during a webinar hosted by The Heritage Foundation . 
" We ’re worried about what it ’s doing to their economies , just like we worry about what it ’s doing to ours . 
The difference being when their economies have struggles , their migration — illegal migration — to our country expands . 
So we ’re watching that very closely and tracking the intelligence in that area as well . " 
CNN reported over the weekend that Latin America recorded nearly 1.2 million coronavirus cases and more than 60,000 deaths .
