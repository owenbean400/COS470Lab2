Adenilson Costa has worked at the Vila Formosa graveyard for a quarter of a century and he says he has never seen the fresh graves fill up so fast . 
It 's the largest cemetery in Latin America , but since coronavirus came to Brazil , it is not big enough . 
Families are hustled through funerals , Costa said , each given no more than 10 or 15 minutes to say goodbye so the cemetery can manage up to 80 burials a day at this site on the outskirts of Sao Paulo . 
" That makes us very shocked , very sad , because it is the last greeting they will give to the loved one that they lost and they do not have time , " Costa said . 
He spoke on a momentous day for Brazil -- a day when the Health Ministry announced more than 45,000 new cases of Covid 19 in the country , one of them the President , Jair Bolsonaro . 
Bolsonaro has spent months downplaying the spread of the lethal virus , even as Brazil became the country with the second most cases -- and deaths -- behind only the United States . 
And while gravedigger Costa is shocked by the rate of death , Bolsonaro told many of his citizens they had nothing to worry about , as he announced he himself had the virus .
