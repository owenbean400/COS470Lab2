Though there is no large outbreak of the coronavirus in Africa or Latin America , several countries in those regions reported their first cases last week , raising concerns the virus may continue spreading . 
In Africa : Cases have been confirmed in Egypt , Algeria , Nigeria , Senegal and Tunisia . 
After confirming the country 's first case , Nigerian authorities expressed confidence in their ability to handle the outbreak , saying the West African Ebola outbreak had prepared the continent well . 
However , the WHO has warned that an outbreak could hit Africa much harder than it did China . 
There are obstacles that could complicate hygiene practices and virus containment ; only 42 % of Nigerians have access to soap and water on their premises , while 25 % have no access to water at all . 
The continent is now preparing preventative measures , such the monitoring of entry points and border crossings by soldiers . 
Experts from the WHO have been sent to particularly vulnerable countries , and the agency is providing African laboratories with testing equipment , reagents for chemical analysis , and staff training . 
In Latin America and the Caribbean : Cases have been confirmed in Mexico , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Ecuador , and the Dominican Republic . 
Similar to US states and cities , countries like Mexico , Guatemala and Panama have declared states of emergency or high level alerts in preparation for a greater outbreak . 
Even countries with no confirmed cases are not taking any chances -- Panama has dedicated $ 2.5 million for a virus response , launched a public information campaign , and is conducting training sessions for healthcare workers .
