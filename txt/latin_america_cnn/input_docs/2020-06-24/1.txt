The International Monetary Fund is warning that the global economic slowdown will be even worse than its first forecast . 
Global growth is now expected to shrink by 4.9 % this year , down from its April estimate of a 3 % contraction , according to IMF ’s world economic outlook . 
That was already due to be the deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
Here are some individual country forecasts : The US economy is expected to shrink by 8 % , while euro area output could decline by 10.2 % , according to IMF . 
In Latin America , the current virus epicenter , Brazil 's economy is expected to contract by 9.1 % , while output in Mexico could decline by 10.5 % . 
China , which got a head start on the recovery , is expected to see growth of 1 % , in part due to policy support from the government . 
IMF ’s new outlook is better than recent forecasts from the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) . 
IMF did note however that there is a " higher than usual degree of uncertainty " around the forecast .
