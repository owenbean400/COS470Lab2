Covid 19 cases in Latin America have now tripled since the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) announced the region had become the new epicenter of the pandemic , the organization 's director said Wednesday . 
There is now widespread transmission in most of Central America , while the Caribbean has hotspots on the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic , as well as in northern South America , Etienne said . 
" Brazil surpassed 1 million Covid 19 cases , joining the United States as the only other country in the world with cases in the six digits , " Etienne said of the South American country . 
" While the recent increase in cases is extremely concerning , we have averted an even greater tragedy , thanks to the early adoption of public health measures , which have helped protect health systems and saved lives in many countries , " Etienne added . 
However , the PAHO director warned that governments are now facing pressure to ease these public health measures due to economic and political reasons , even though transmission is increasing . 
" In the absence of effective treatments , or of widely available vaccines , we expect that over the next two years in the region of the Americas we will experience recurring Covid 19 outbreaks , which may be interspersed with periods of limited transmission , " Etienne said . 
" We must be realistic about the future . 
All of us must adjust to a new way of life , and redefine our sense of normal , " she added . 
" The question is no longer how do we go back to the way things were before , but rather , how do we move forward and build a sustainable outbreak response . "
