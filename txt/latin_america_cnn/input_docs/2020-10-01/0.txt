The pandemic has put 500,000 more girls at risk of being forced into child marriage this year , reversing 25 years of progress that saw child marriage rates decline , according to a new report by the charity Save the Children . 
Before the global outbreak , 12 million girls married each year , now the charity warns that up to 2.5 million more girls could be at risk of child marriage over the next five years . 
With up to 117 million children estimated to fall into poverty in 2020 , many will face pressure to work and help provide for their families . " 
The pandemic led to school closures and " experience during the Ebola outbreak suggests many girls will never return " to class due " to increasing pressure to work , risk of child marriage , bans on pregnant girls attending school , and lost contact with education , " the charity wrote . 
Who is at risk ? 
This year , 191,200 girls in South Asia will be disproportionately affected by the risk of increased child marriage , the report says . 
It is followed by West and Central Africa , where 90,000 girls are at risk of child marriage , Latin America and the Caribbean ( 73,400 ) , and Europe and Central Asia ( 37,200 ) . 
" Every year , around 12 million girls are married , 2 million before their 15th birthday , " Ashing said . 
" Half a million more girls are now at risk of this gender based violence this year alone -- and these only are the ones we know about . 
We believe this is the tip of the iceberg . "
