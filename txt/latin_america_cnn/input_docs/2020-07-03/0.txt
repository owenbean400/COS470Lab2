The ILO also analyzed the latest numbers from the International Monetary Fund , which estimated an economic contraction of 9.4 % , resulting in a 13 % unemployment rate . 
What the rates mean : " In absolute numbers , these rates imply an increase in the number of people who are looking for a job and do not get it ; from 26 million before the pandemic to 41 million in 2020 , " ILO specialists explained at a press conference on Wednesday .
