In Spain , Reuters reports that the Catalonian government has approved a decree giving it legal backing to place restrictions on the city of Lleida and its surroundings to stem a surge in infections , defying a judge ’s earlier ruling that such an order was unlawful . 
After an extraordinary late night cabinet meeting , the regional government said it would seek legal authorisation allowing it to limit people ’s movements , adding that on Tuesday it could confine Lleida area inhabitants at home . 
Earlier on Monday , Catalonia ’s leader Quim Torra urged the 160,000 people living in an area where cases have increased to stay home , defying a court ruling which rejected a mandatory home confinement . 
The contradicting orders sowed confusion and anger in the area . 
Businesses feared for their survival and the mayor said he was at a loss about what to tell people . 
Spain , which has been one of the European countries worst affected by the pandemic , lifted a strict nationwide lockdown last month as it seemed to have come under control . 
But , with dozens of new clusters , local authorities across Spain are scrambling to take new measures , confining small areas or making it mandatory to wear a mask in public . 
" We do not agree with this court ruling . 
We do not accept it , " Torra , who leads Catalonia ’s pro independence regional government , told a news conference on Monday after Judge Elena García Muñoz Alarcos threw out the planned mandatory lockdown .
