Health authorities in Spain have revised downward the country ’s death toll from the coronavirus by nearly 2,000 , bringing the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834 , AFP reports . 
A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus , said Fernando Simon , the health ministry ’s emergencies coordinator . 
" A variation of 1,900 , that ’s a lot , " he added . 
" We are trying to check that it ’s correct , but these are the figures that we have at the moment . " 
The health ministry , which gathers data from regional health authorities , also revised downwards the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus , from the 235,772 announced on Sunday to 235,400 . 
" We are satisfied with the growing quality of the information that allows us to take decisions , " said Simon . 
" It is something that happens in every epidemic , when the evolution of the epidemic leaves us with a bit more time , you have to correct the figures and in certain cases you have to reduce them , " he explained . 
While the new system cut the number of deaths by 1,918 , Spain remains one of the countries worst hit by the virus .
