Meanwhile , new analysis from the US has found that masks and social distancing can help control the coronavirus but hand washing and other measures are still needed , AP reports . 
Researchers concluded single layer cloth masks are less effective than surgical masks , while tight fitting N95 masks provide the best protection . 
A distance of 1 meter ( more than 3 feet ) between people lowers the danger of catching the virus , while 2 meters ( about 6 1/2 feet ) is even better . 
Eye protection such as eyeglasses or goggles can help too . 
None of the strategies work perfectly and more rigorous studies are needed , according to the analysis published Monday . 
With the coronavirus still new , health officials have relied on studies involving its cousins , severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome . 
The findings come from a systematic review of 44 studies , including seven involving the virus causing Covid 19 . 
The remaining focused on SARS or MERS . 
Public health officials have given conflicting advice about masks . 
The World Health Organization , which funded the new analysis , has said healthy people need to wear a mask only if they are caring for a person with Covid 19 . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants everyone to wear at least a cloth mask when grocery shopping or in similar situations where keeping distance is difficult .
