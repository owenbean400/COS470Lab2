More than half of countries in the EU , plus the UK , were on Thursday labelled red in a new map issued by the bloc â€™s disease control agency aimed at guiding decisions on travel restrictions . 
The map was issued after EU member states decided on Tuesday to coordinate their approach to travel restrictions on other countries in response to Covid 19 outbreaks . 
Seventeen of 31 countries covered by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) were labelled red or mostly red , meaning average daily cases over the previous 14 day period were 50 or higher per 100,000 inhabitants coupled with a test positivity rate of over 4 % . 
The red rating is if the 14 day notification rate is 150 cases or higher per 100,000 . 
In addition to the 27 EU countries , the ECDC covers the UK , Norway , Iceland and Liechtenstein . 
A green rating means the 14 day notification rate is lower than 25 cases per 100,000 and the test positivity rate below 4 % , and orange are those that fall between red and green . 
Member states agreed not to impose travel restrictions on travellers from regions rated " green " , but none achieved that level nationwide . 
For countries that are red and orange , members states are free to decide what measures , if any , they wish to impose but could , for instance , require travellers coming from those countries to undergo quarantine or a Covid 19 test . 
Five countries - Austria , Germany , Sweden , Denmark and Iceland - did not receive a rating , with the agency citing a lack of information .
