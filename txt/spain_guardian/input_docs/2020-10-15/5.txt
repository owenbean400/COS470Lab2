The UK government ’s flagship policy for tackling the coronavirus in England has descended into chaos after mayors and MPs from the north west of the country emphatically rejected being moved into the highest lockdown level and accused ministers of treating the region with contempt . 
Talks to reach an agreement ended with bitter and angry exchanges , deepening a north south rift that has left the government ’s strategy of tiered restrictions in turmoil . 
While ministers could still unilaterally impose a lockdown , they believe local leaders ’ cooperation is crucial in communicating and enforcing the restrictions . 
The mayor of Greater Manchester , Andy Burnham , said he would not accept his area being treated " as canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy " , one he said even the government ’s own medical advisers did not think would work . 
Burnham was backed by exasperated MPs from Greater Manchester , and from Lancashire , the other area set to join the Liverpool city region in the " very high risk " tier 3 category , which entails the closure of pubs and bars . 
This included a number of Conservatives . 
One said of negotiating with the government : " You might as well talk to a wall . " 
Another Labour MP described the talks as a " shitshow " .
