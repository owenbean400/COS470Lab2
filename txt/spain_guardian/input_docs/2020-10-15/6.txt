All House of Commons bars and restaurants will be banned from selling alcohol as of Saturday , the Speaker has confirmed . 
Sir Lindsay Hoyle said : Following the [ UK ] government â€™s decision to move London into the Tier 2 Covid alert category , I have asked the parliamentary authorities to introduce measures to bring the House of Commons into line with the national picture . 
As MPs represent different constituencies in different tiers - with the very highest level ordering the closure of pubs - I have decided to stop the sale of alcohol across the House of Commons end of the estate from this Saturday . 
This means it will not be possible to buy an alcoholic drink from any of our catering outlets for the foreseeable future - whether food is served or not . 
The House of Commons Commission will be meeting on Monday to consider other measures needed to protect MPs , their staff and House staff , while maintaining our Covid secure status . "
