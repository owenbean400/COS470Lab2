Trump is back on the World Health Organization . 
The WHO " covered up for China , " he says repeatedly . 
He also says he â€™s going to win " in a landslide " in November . 
He adds that stopping arrivals from China and Europe were very difficult decisions that he took , which , he says , Dr Deborah Birx herself has said saved " tens of thousands of lives " . 
The truth here is obviously that tens of thousands more could have been saved . 
The current death toll in the US , the highest in the world , is 41,816 , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The number of confirmed infections , at 783,000 , is almost four times higher than those in the next worst affected country , Spain , which has 200,210 . 
Spain has 20,852 deaths .
