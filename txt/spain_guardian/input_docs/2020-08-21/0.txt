Sweden has chosen the right strategy in fighting the spread of the new coronavirus , prime minister Stefan Lofven said , defending his government ’s decision not to adopt a strict lockdown as many European countries have done . 
More than 5,800 Swedes have died of Covid 19 , a much higher death rate than Norway , Denmark and Finland which adopted much tougher measures , leading many to question the government ’s approach . 
But Lofven said Sweden made the correct choice . 
" The strategy that we adopted , I believe is right - to protect individuals , limit the spread of the infection , etc , " he said in an interview in daily Dagens Nyheter . 
" What has been discussed most , and what we did differently in Sweden , was that we did not close schools . 
Now there are quite a few people who think we were right . " 
Whereas many countries enforced strict lockdowns , Sweden has relied mainly on voluntary measures focused on social distancing , though public gatherings have been limited and care homes - which saw a heavy death toll - quarantined . 
While Sweden has seen more fatalities than its neighbours , it has not been as badly hit as countries like Britain and Spain , which adopted much stricter lockdown measures . 
And many parts of Europe are seeing a pick up in new cases as they gradually loosen restrictions on travel and social interactions , Sweden has seen a decline in both infections and deaths in recent weeks . 
Lofven also defended the decision by the Public Health Agency not to enforce the wearing of facemasks , as many European countries have done , to fight the spread of the virus . 
" What they are saying , and what I absolutely believe , is that they cannot be the main tool we use , " Lofven said . 
" What is important still is social distancing , testing and tracking . 
Those must be our main focus in order to reduce infection . "
