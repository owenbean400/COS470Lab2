NHS healthcare workers received a round of applause and flowers from Tesco staff in a show of support for their work against the pandemic . 
Tesco told the PA news agency that staff at stores across the country independently decided to make the gesture as part of the â€˜ NHS hour â€™ it has introduced . 
This will allow healthcare workers to arrive an hour earlier every Sunday to buy supplies . 
A huge thank you to @ Tesco and other stores who have opened this morning for # NHS staff . 
NHS workers were handed flowers at Twickenham Extra and the staff gave everyone a round of applause .
