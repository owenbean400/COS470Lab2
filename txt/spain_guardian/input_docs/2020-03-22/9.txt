The Welsh government has warned that people will face a tough crackdown if they refuse to self isolate and continue with non essential travel during the outbreak . 
First Minister Mark Drakeford said it is important members of the public follow the official advice to prevent further deaths . 
" Self isolation for those who have symptoms and social distancing by everyone is absolutely essential at this stage if we are to delay the spread of this virus and save lives , " the First Minister said . 
" We all need to follow this advice now to protect each other and our families and to help ensure our NHS is not overwhelmed . 
Social distancing includes avoiding all but essential travel and if people do not follow this advice we will have no choice but to use powers to enforce it . " 
The First Minister â€™s warning follows a similar message from Boris Johnson , where he outlined that stricter measures would be enforced if social distancing was not observed . 
Across Wales , 12 people with Covid 19 have died and a further 347 have tested positive for the virus .
