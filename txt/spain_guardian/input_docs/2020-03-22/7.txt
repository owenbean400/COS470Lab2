Mc Donald ’s has said it is closing all its UK and Ireland restaurants from Monday night . 
In a statement , its UK CEO , Paul Pomroy , said : " I am incredibly grateful to our brilliant employees who have been working hard to continue to serve you safely in difficult circumstances . 
" Over the last 24 hours , it has become clear that maintaining safe social distancing whilst operating busy takeaway and Drive Thru restaurants is increasingly difficult and therefore we have taken the decision to close every restaurant in the UK and Ireland by 7pm on Monday 23 March . 
" We will be working closely with community groups across the UK and Ireland to distribute food from our restaurants to those most in need , and ahead of closing tomorrow evening , will ensure frontline health workers and emergency services personnel do not have to pay for any food or drink in our restaurants on sight of their work pass . 
" Take care of one another in these unprecedented times , we look forward to seeing you again as soon as it is safe for us to reopen . "
