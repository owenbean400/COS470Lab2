US state and local governments could need close to $ 1 trillion in aid over several years to cope with the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic , House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned . 
She told reporters : " We ’re not going to be able to cover all of it , but to the extent that we can keep the states and localities sustainable , that ’s our goal . " 
Asked if state and local aid would be the largest part of upcoming relief legislation , Pelosi said : " I ’ve talked about almost a trillion dollars right there , I would hope so . 
But we do have other issues that we want to deal with . " 
President Donald Trump said he would " think about what ’s happening . "
