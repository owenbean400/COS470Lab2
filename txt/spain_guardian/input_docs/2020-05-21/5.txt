Half of Facebook ’s workforce could shift to permanent home working by the end of the decade , founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed , according to the Press Association . 
The social network ’s chief set out his vision to employees on Thursday , prompted by the coronavirus crisis which has forced companies across the globe to embrace remote working in recent months . 
Zuckerberg said it is " quite possible " that over the next five to 10 years about 50 % of staff at the company could be working from home , though he warned that those interested could see salaries cut if they decide to be located away from big cities where living expenses tend to be higher . 
The tech giant also plans to " aggressively open up " remote hiring , though the process will be staggered , starting with experienced engineers living in the US and Canada . 
" This is fundamentally about changing our culture , in the way that we all are going to work long term , so I think I ’m optimistic about this direction , but I want to make sure that we move forward in a measured way , " Zuckerberg said . 
" At the same time , I also want to emphasise that I just think Covid is going to be with us for a while to come . " 
The 36 year old hopes that the move will help retain workers that want to live in areas further away from offices , while attracting new talent from further afield . 
More than 95 % of Facebook ’s staff are currently working from home due to Covid 19 . 
The success of permanent remote working would " rely on the honour code " , Zuckerberg said , adding it was vital for tax and accounting purposes for people to declare their locations .
