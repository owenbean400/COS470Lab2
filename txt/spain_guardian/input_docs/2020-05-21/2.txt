Data on coronavirus infections that was a key driver in Governor Brian Kemps ’ aggressive push to reopen the US state of Georgia was flawed and may have distorted perceptions of progress against the virus , the Associated Press reports . 
Georgia Department of Public Health spokeswoman Nancy Nydam said in a statement on Thursday that the department included antibody tests when calculating the total number of tests conducted since early April . 
She said about 57,000 of the 407,000 total tests reported to the state had been antibody tests , about 14 % . 
Conflating tests looking for antibodies and tests aimed at detecting the virus can create confusion about the current impact of the virus , said Richard Rothenberg , an infectious disease expert at Georgia State University , adding that the mistake would have made a substantial impact on the perception of the outbreak . 
Kemp relied on the state seeing a downward trajectory of the percentage of positive tests when making his decision to be one of the first states in the nation to allow business to reopen . 
Salons , restaurants , gyms and other businesses in Georgia were given the green light to reopen in April . 
Kemp ’s spokeswoman Candice Broce declined to comment .
