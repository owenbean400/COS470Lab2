Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Brazil has just passed another grim coronavirus milestone , with more than 20,000 deaths from Covid 19 now officially confirmed here . 
On Thursday evening Brazil ’s health ministry announced a daily record of 1,188 deaths confirmed in the last 24 hours , taking the total number of officially recorded deaths to 20,047 . 
Brazil also confirmed another 18,508 infections , taking the total number to 310,087 . 
That is the third highest number in the world , after the US and Russia . 
Despite Brazil ’s rising death toll the country ’s far right president , Jair Bolsonaro , continues to downplay the dangers of the coronavirus , which he has repeatedly dismissed as " a bit of a cold " and " a little flu " . 
On Thursday , just hours before the new death toll was announced , Bolsonaro claimed the pandemic ’s threat had been exaggerated with " a great deal of propaganda " . 
" This has brought dread to the heart of the Brazilian family , " Bolsonaro complained . 
Sub notification and low rates of testing mean the real number of infections and deaths are likely to be substantially higher . 
Some experts fear Brazil ’s death toll could rise to at least 100,000 in the coming months .
