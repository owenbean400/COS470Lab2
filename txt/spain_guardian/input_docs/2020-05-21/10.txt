A scientific adviser to the British government has said that he would have liked ministers to have acted " a week or two weeks earlier " in the virus pandemic , the BBC reports . 
Ian Boyd , who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( Sage ) , which advises ministers on Covid 19 , said " it would have made " quite a big difference " to the death rate . 
Ministers have always insisted they have been guided by the scientific advice during the pandemic . 
The official death toll in the UK currently stands at 36,042 . 
Boyd started attending Sage meetings a month ago . " Acting very early was really important and I would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate , " he said . 
" And I think that â€™s really the number one issue - could we have acted earlier ? 
Were the signs there earlier on ? " 
Boyd suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( Sars ) virus , which is less infectious than this coronavirus .
