Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches , restaurants , churches , malls and hair salons next week under strict new rules as the US territory emerges from a two month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island already beset with economic woes . 
Governor Wanda Vázquez announced Thursday that most businesses will reopen on Tuesday , but a 7pm to 5am curfew will remain in place until June 15 , the Associated Press reports . 
All people will be required to wear a mask when outside or inside a business , regardless of what they are doing . 
Restaurants will be allowed to operate at 25 % capacity . 
Hair salons and barber shops will welcome clients by appointment only . 
People doing exercise , such as surfing , jogging , swimming or kayaking , will be allowed at the beach from 5am to 7pm . 
Stores and malls will be allowed to reopen but under limited capacity , and people will be prohibited from trying on clothes , among other restrictions . 
Many Puerto Ricans , including business owners , cheered the highly anticipated announcement . 
Health experts warned that the government has not tested enough people or conducted enough contact tracing and is not prepared for a possible spike in new infections . 
Puerto Ricos Health Department has reported more than 2,900 confirmed Covid 19 cases and at least 126 deaths , and dozens of additional infections still emerge every day . 
Officials do not regularly update statistics , including how many people have been tested or how many have recovered . 
Until recently , the island had a lower per capita testing rate than any US state . 
Puerto Rico ’s lockdown caused the unemployment rate to spike to an estimated 40 % on an island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40 % , higher than any U.S . state .
