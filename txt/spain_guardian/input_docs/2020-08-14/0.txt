France has declared Paris and the port city of Marseille high risk zones for coronavirus as the government reported more than 2,500 new infections for the third day in a row . 
However , the number of people hospitalised due to the disease continued to fall , having dipped below 5,000 for the first time since mid March on Wednesday . 
While the number of new infections is up in all age groups , it has risen particularly sharply among 25 to 35 year olds . 
The health care system appears to be holding up at least in part as this group is less likely to need hospital care . 
The number of people in ICUs has fallen to 367 , a new low since mid March and a level almost 20 times lower than a 7,148 peak reached on 8 April . 
Health ministry epidemiologist Daniel Levy Bruhl said authorities are not " presently worried by the hospital situation but we are worried of how this situation could evolve if measures are not taken to stop the increase of cases we ’re witnessing " . 
The daily death toll increased by 18 to 30,406 on Friday , compared to 17 over the last two days . 
France ’s total number of cases stands at 212,211 .
