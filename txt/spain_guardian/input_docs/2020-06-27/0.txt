Thousands of people hit the streets across Spain on Saturday to demand a collective rebuilding of society to tackle the fallout from the Covid 19 pandemic , in the biggest demonstrations since the crisis began . 
Called by the Workers Commissions and UGT unions , rallies took place throughout the day in some 60 towns and cities with organisers saying " many thousands " had taken part , without providing a figure . 
Unions are demanding a concerted response to ensure social and economic reconstruction following a crisis that has dealt a hammer blow to Spain ’s economy . 
" We want the country to be rebuilt , we need a national agreement so this pandemic wo not be politically exploited , " UGT boss Pepe Alvarez told AFP in Madrid , where more than a thousand mask wearing demonstrators held a socially distanced march . 
" We need to improve public services as part of a national agreement that leads to recovery and an improvement in our economy , " Alvarez said . 
Although the government had done " more than any government before " through its furlough scheme and introducing a minimum basic income , there were still many people " who are really suffering " , he said . 
Demonstrator Ana Sanchez de la Cueva , 61 , said the aim was to ensure that ordinary people do not end up paying for the crisis , either economically or in terms of their health . 
" There are two reasons we ’re here : to call for a proper economic recovery so we can all emerge from this crisis with dignity , and to demand that public services be strengthened , " she said .
