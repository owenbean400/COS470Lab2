Portugal has downgraded its state of emergency to a category of " calamity " , as the rate of new coronavirus infections reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak , six weeks after a state of emergency was declared . 
" It ’s like being freed from prison , " enthused Rodrigo Garcia , 40 , on a walk to Lisbon ’s River Tagus with his wife , two sons and dog . 
" We ’ve gone out here and there , but with the end of the state of emergency we feel much freer . " 
A three phase reopening plan begins on Monday , after a six week state of emergency when people were urged to stay indoors except for brief exercise , and most non essential services were shut . 
Beaches remain closed other than for water sports and exercise , but under the lesser state of calamity spending time in parks is no longer strictly forbidden . 
Still , police officers were out in force on Sunday urging people not to linger and to maintain social distancing . 
" A state of calamity still means you should stay home as much as you can , " officer Sofia Gordinho told Reuters . 
" If people want to sit in the sun for a bit , that ’s okay , but we are asking them to move on so others can come without it getting crowded . " 
Spared the huge tolls in neighbouring Spain and some other Western European nations , Portugal reported 25,282 cases of the new coronavirus on Sunday , just 0.4 % more than the day before , and 1,043 deaths in a population of 10 million people .
