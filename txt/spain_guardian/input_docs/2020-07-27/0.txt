Britain ’s decision to impose a quarantine on people travelling from Spain is unfair , Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said . 
He added that the Spanish government is in touch with British authorities in a bid to get the country to reconsider its position . 
Sanchez said the UK ’s " error " was to consider the rate of coronavirus infection in Spain as a whole , when most regions have a lower rate than Britain ’s .
