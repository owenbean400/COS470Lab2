Quarantine for people arriving from Spain and other countries with high levels of Covid 19 will be cut to 10 days under plans being finalised by UK ministers , The Telegraph has reported . 
The UK government will announce this week a new policy of testing arrivals from high risk countries eight days after they land , it said . 
If they test negative they will be allowed to come out of self isolation two days later , reducing the mandatory quarantine period by four days , the report said . 
A government spokesman told the Telegraph the 10 day quarantine period is under discussion but a final decision has not been made . 
The government is also considering telling everyone who has come into the UK from Spain since 23 July , including returning holidaymakers , to take a coronavirus test , the report added . 
Britain dealt a new blow to Spain on Monday by extending guidance advising against all non essential travel , which already applied to mainland Spain , to include the Balearic and Canary Islands .
