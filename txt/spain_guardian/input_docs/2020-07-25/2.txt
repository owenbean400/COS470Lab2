Britain ’s abruptly announced reintroduction of a two week quarantine for all travellers arriving from Spain after a surge of coronavirus cases is set to have a dramatic impact on Spain ’s tourism sector , which had just started to attempt a recovery after months of lockdown . 
The quarantine requirement was due to take effect from midnight ( 2300 GMT on Saturday ) , making it impossible for travellers to avoid it by rushing home . 
Tour operator TUI said it was " incredibly disappointed " that the British government did not give more notice of this announcement , and said that all its customers currently in Spain would return on their intended flight home . 
TUI said it had cancelled all flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the canary islands on Sunday 26 July , according to Reuters . 
The sudden British move followed steps this week by other European countries . 
On Friday Norway said it would re impose a 10 day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday , while France advised people not to travel to Spain ’s northeastern region of Catalonia . 
But the total collapse of tourism from Britain would have far more impact . 
Britain accounted for more than 20 % of the foreign visitors to Spain last year , the largest group by nationality . 
Tourism normally accounts for some 12 % of Spain ’s economy .
