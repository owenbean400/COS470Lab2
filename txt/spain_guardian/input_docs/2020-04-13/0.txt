As Trump continues to boast of his success in managing the coronavirus pandemic in the US – the epicentre of the crisis worldwide , with 400,000 more confirmed cases than Spain , the next worst affected country – 42 residents of a Virginia nursing home near Richmond have died from the Covid 19 disease pandemic in one of the worst clusters of the new coronavirus in the United States , and officials expect more deaths to come . 
At least 127 elderly people out of the 163 residents of the Canterbury Rehabilitation & amp ; 
Healthcare Center in Henrico County have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks , said its medical director Dr . James Wright . 
News reports say the latest two people died in the last three days . 
" It ’s been tough , " Wright , 56 , said in an interview with Reuters . 
" We were surprised by how quickly this went through , " he said . 
Wright told media at a recent news conference : " It ’s a battle that at times we feel like we ’re losing . 
It ’s a battle that we have to fight every day and night , seven days a week . " 
At least 35 members of Canterbury ’s staff have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Monday , but Wright said he did not know how many have fallen ill . 
But he said the virus has exacerbated an existing staffing shortage , with some staffers refusing to come to work for fear of getting ill . 
" We did the best we could , " he said .
