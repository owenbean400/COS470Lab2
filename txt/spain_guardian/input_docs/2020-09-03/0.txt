Hungary has refused to grant final approval of the EU ’s planned € 750bn ( $ 889bn ) borrowing to spur economic recovery in the bloc from the coronavirus pandemic without guarantees on a linked mechanism on the rule of law , diplomatic sources said . 
Prime minister Viktor Orbán has long been at loggerheads with the EU over democratic checks and balances , and stands accused of undermining the independence of the judiciary , media , academics and advocacy groups in Hungary . 
Under a historic deal , the EU agreed last July that its executive would borrow € 750bn on the market to top up a trillion euros worth of spending under the bloc ’s joint budget in 2021-27 to help the continent recover from the Covid 19 slump . 
The agreement between the 27 member states still requires approval by the European parliament , as well as many national parliaments across the EU . 
The package would also link access to EU funds to respecting democratic principles , which Orbán now wants to ensure would not hurt him in order to grant Hungary ’s final approval , according to the sources . 
" Hungary has said that , to pass that decision , they want to sort out the rule of law , " one senior EU diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity . 
Hungary ’s justice ministry on Thursday said that the July deal was an overall package and that " none of its components can be decoupled or removed from the package and decided or amended separately from other components . " 
" Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed , " it added . 
While the European parliament wants to toughen the rule of law conditions on obtaining EU funds , countries like Spain and Italy that have been hit hardest by the pandemic demand smooth ratification to ensure the money starts flowing swiftly .
