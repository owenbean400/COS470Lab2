The spread of the coronavirus has spurred Mexican authorities to impose local restrictions on mobility , commerce , and leisure , particularly in popular tourist destinations , even as the government seeks to revive the battered economy . 
On Wednesday , authorities in the Caribbean beach resort of Tulum threatened to fine or arrest people for disobeying rules on wearing face masks , the latest in a series of local and state level curbs against the spread of the virus . 
Eager to lift an economy that is forecast to shrink as much as 10 % this year , Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has encouraged people to get out , and has resisted reimposing more stringent nationwide restrictions . 
But some local authorities worry if they do not take precautions , the hit to their livelihoods will be worse . 
" We ca not play with the health of the citizens , " Tulum â€™s mayor , Victor Mas Tah , said in comments reported by local media .
