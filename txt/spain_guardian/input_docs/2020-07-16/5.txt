Georgia governor Brian Kemp is suing Atlanta to block the city from enforcing its mandate to wear a mask in public and other rules related to the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Kemp and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr , in a suit filed in state court late Thursday , argued that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has overstepped her authority and must obey Kemp ’s executive orders under state law . 
The suit comes a day after Kemp clarified his executive orders to expressly block Atlanta and at least 14 other local governments across the state from requiring people to wear face coverings . 
Kemp ’s order was met with defiance by Bottoms and some other mayors , who said they would continue enforcing the order and were prepared to go to court . 
The lawsuit will force that showdown , resolving what had been an ambiguous situation with Kemp denying local governments could order masks , but local governments arguing it was within their power . 
Bottoms last week issued what initially appeared to be orders that people had to return to sheltering at home and forcing restaurants to return to only offering takeout and delivery . 
Kemp swatted that down in public statements , and Bottoms on Thursday described them as guidelines . 
But Kemp ’s lawsuit says the court should set Bottoms straight on those orders as well .
