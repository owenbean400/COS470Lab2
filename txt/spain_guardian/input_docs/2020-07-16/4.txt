Oliver Holmes , The Guardian ’s Jerusalem correspondent , is reporting it is unlikely the Israeli government will announce new lockdown measures tonight . 
Late on Thursday , and without giving details of what steps he was suggesting , prime minister Netanyahu ’s office said on Twitter that he had told the cabinet he was " making every effort to avoid a general lockdown " . 
It was not clear if or when the government might announce changes , although Netanyahu added he would give ministers a week to come up with suggestions " for the safe opening up of the economy " .
