A church in Bergamo that served as a temporary morgue at the height of Italy ’s coronavirus epidemic " is finally empty " , the mayor said Saturday . 
La chiesa del cimitero di # Bergamo vuota . 
Finalmente . 
Where dozens of coffins once stood , nothing but flowers are left to be seen in a photograph tweeted by mayor Giorgio Gori that symbolises the easing of a crisis that has killed over 23,000 people in Italy . 
Bergamo is in the wealthy northern region of Lombardy , which accounts for over half Italy ’s virus victims . 
Italy ’s coronavirus emergency czar Domenico Arcuri said Saturday that five times as many people had died in the region during the epidemic than had been killed in Milan during World War II bombings . 
" We are living through a great tragedy , which we have not yet overcome , " he said , describing the nearly 12,000 Lombardy dead as an " astounding " figure .
