A second official confirmed the number and said an additional 12 people from the president ’s administrative office had also contracted the virus . 
Ghani ’s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi declined to comment and referred questions to the health ministry , which also would not comment , saying it did not disclose the identity of its patients .
