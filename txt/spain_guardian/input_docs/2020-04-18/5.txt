Twickenham has become the latest major sports stadium in Britain to be given a role in the fight against the coronavirus , reports AFP . 
The headquarters of English rugby union , located in south west London , will host a drive through coronavirus testing facility that is part of the British government â€™s nationwide effort to increase testing for thousands more NHS staff and other key workers . 
" This new service will help end the uncertainty of whether NHS and social care staff and other key workers need to stay at home , meaning those who test negative will be able to return to work , " said health minister Lord James Bethell .
