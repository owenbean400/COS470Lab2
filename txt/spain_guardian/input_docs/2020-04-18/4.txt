Spain ’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a third 15 day extension of the lockdown imposed to curb one of the world ’s worst outbreaks of the new coronavirus , taking the restrictions up to 9 May . Sanchez said he wanted to relax restrictions on children , who would be allowed out of their homes after 27 April , though that allowance would be " limited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion " . 
He did not go into further details . 
Spain has begun to ease a strict lockdown imposed on 14 March and this week opened up some sectors of the economy , including manufacturing . 
But most people are still confined to their houses except for essential outings including shopping for food .
