Police used tear gas late on Wednesday to disperse hundreds of Albanians protesting the killing by police of a young man who authorities said had violated an overnight curfew imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus . 
A 25 year old man identified by Albanian media as Klodian Rasha was killed early on Tuesday in what police described as an excessive use of force by an officer during a curfew introduced to prevent the surge of Covid 19 cases . 
The police had first said that Rasha failed to obey a police officer â€™s order to stop and that he had carried a weapon . 
But later the police said the man was holding an object but not a weapon , as initially reported . 
Protesters who were demanding the resignation of the interior minister threw objects at his ministry and set Christmas trees on fire as police used tear gas to disperse the crowd , a Reuters witness said . 
Two police officers and a journalist were reported slightly injured . 
The police officer who allegedly killed the man was arrested and an investigation was launched . 
" The police officer did not act according to the law while using his firearm , " Albanian police said in a statement . 
Albanian government has introduced different measures , including a curfew , to prevent rising number of Covid 19 infections .
