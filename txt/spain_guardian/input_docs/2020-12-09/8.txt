South Africa has officially entered a second wave as the number of new infections per day exceeds 6,000 , the health minister said on Wednesday , raising concerns that restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could be tightened . 
The health minister Zwelini Mkhize said in a televised address that infections stood at over 828,000 cases with deaths at more than 22,500 , the most on the continent . 
Daily cases peaked at around 15,000 in July . 
" The increases are shown in about six of the provinces and that is why it is important for us to now recognise this is a second wave , " said Mkhize during a televised address . 
South Africa is experiencing a resurgence of new cases in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape . 
The president Cyril Ramaphosa last week tightened rules in the Eastern Cape province , but stopped short of a wider crackdown . 
Mkhize also expressed concern that in the last two days the distribution of new cases had peaked in those aged between 15 and 19 . 
School students who attended a series of end of year parties were urged on Sunday to enter 10 days of quarantine after identifying four such parties as " super spreader events " .
