My colleague Sam Jones reports that the regional government of Catalonia has ordered around 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for a fortnight from 9pm tonight after a steep increase in Coronavirus cases in the area . 
Igualada , Vilanova del Camí , Santa Margarida de Montbui and Òdena have been placed in lockdown after the number of cases linked to a hospital in Igualada rose to 58 on Thursday . 
" No one is allowed out of these affected areas , " the regional government said on Thursday evening . 
" Only emergency personnel and vehicles bringing fuel and food supplies will be allowed to move round the area . " 
The move comes almost a week after neighbourhoods in a small town in the northern region of La Rioja were placed in lockdown after a cluster of cases was traced to a funeral in the nearby Basque Country . 
Meanwhile , Santiago Abascal , the leader of Spain ’s far right Vox party , has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus days after the party ’s general secretary , Javier Ortega Smith , was diagnosed with the virus . 
Earlier this week , the party apologised for holding a 9,000 person rally in Madrid on Sunday .
