Appearing with first lady Melania Trump in front of the White House , the president made brief remarks thanking healthcare workers and researchers working on a Covid 19 vaccine . 
According to tradition , two turkeys named Corn and Cob stayed at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel before the official ceremony . 
After an online poll , Corn was chosen to be pardoned . 
Trump did not take questions at the event , and ignored a shouted question about whether he was considering pardoning himself .
