Handling bank notes poses only a low risk of spreading Covid 19 , the Bank of England has said , after it commissioned research to find out how long the virus lasts on cash . 
The use of notes has dropped sharply in the UK since the pandemic hit in March , and the Bank said one reason could be fears that cash can carry the virus . 
After reopening following the first lockdown , many shops and hospitality venues in the UK encouraged consumers to make contactless payments , while some refused to take any cash . 
However , the Bank ’s research found that the risk of getting coronavirus from handling bank notes was much lower than that of contracting it from breathing air particles in a shop , or from touching items like shopping baskets , door handles or self checkout terminals . 
Its study involved a very high dose of coronavirus , equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing directly on to the bank note , and included tests on paper and polymer £ 10 notes . 
After contamination , the notes were stored at room temperature and repeatedly tested . 
The study found that the level of virus remained stable for an hour , but over the next five hours it declined rapidly , and after 24 hours it had dropped to less than 1 % on both types of note .
