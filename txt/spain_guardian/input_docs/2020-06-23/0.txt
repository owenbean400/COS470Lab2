Barcelona disco owners have condemned a regional decision to maintain a ban on dancing , unless you are at a hotel or restaurant and know your partner well . 
" We want to dance " the discotheques said in a statement in response to a U turn by the Catalan regional government on the issue . 
It had lifted the dance ban in discos and nightclubs last week as Spain eased one of Europe â€™s strictest coronavirus lockdowns . 
But on Monday , officials backpedaled on the decision , saying night clubs would have to keep people off the dance floor , if necessary by putting tables and chairs there . 
Dance floors in hotels and restaurants were allowed to stay open , but only if they were used by " groups of people often together and in close contact " . 
Social media had a field day with the decision , but disco owners who have been hoping to open again were not amused . 
Ramon Mas , head of the Barcelona discotheque federation , told a regional parliament hearing : A night club without dancing is like an opera without music or a restaurant without food . 
We will not reopen if we cannot let people dance .
