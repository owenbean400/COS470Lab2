Confidence in the way Sweden ’s prime minister Stefan Lofven and his government have handled the coronavirus pandemic has dropped sharply over the last three months , a poll in daily Dagens Nyheter showed . 
Sweden has followed its own path in fighting the coronavirus , rejecting a strict lockdown and relying mainly on voluntary measures focused on social distancing . 
Most schools and many businesses have remained open . 
Around 34 % of Swedes believe Social Democrat PM Lofven has handled the crisis well against 49 % in May , a survey by pollsters IPSOS showed . 
The government ’s numbers also fell as did those for the political opposition . 
But Swedes do not appear to have lost faith in the overall strategy for fighting the coronavirus , with confidence in the Public Health Agency and its chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell - who has become the public face of the country ’s response - remaining relatively strong . 
In April , 69 % of Swedes had very or quite strong confidence in the Agency , with that falling to 58 % in August . 
Tegnell ’s figures dropped from 69 % to 63 % over the period . 
The death toll in Sweden has been much higher in relation to the size of its population than its Nordic neighbours , who all took much more stringent lockdown measures , though lower than in countries like Britain and Spain . 
More than 5,800 Swedes have died against around 260 in Norway , which has around half the population .
