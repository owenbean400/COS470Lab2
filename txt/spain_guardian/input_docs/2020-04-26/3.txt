Dubai said on Sunday it had lifted its full lockdown on two commercial districts with large populations of low income migrant workers , after the United Arab Emirates eased nationwide coronavirus curfews over the weekend . 
On Friday , Dubai cut its emirate wide 24 hour lockdown back to a 10pm to 6am curfew , and allowed dine in cafes and restaurants to resume business with a maximum capacity of 30 % and shopping malls to be reopened partially . 
It has now taken the same step in the Al Ras and Naif districts , which had been sealed off as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus , Reuters reports . 
The UAE has reported more than 10,300 cases and 76 deaths resulting from the virus , the second highest count among the six Gulf Arab countries after Saudi Arabia . 
The Gulf states , where expatriates make up the bulk of the labour force , have seen infections spread among low wage foreign workers living in cramped quarters despite measures to combat the disease including the suspension of passenger flights , curfews and the closure of public spaces . 
Mosques , cinemas and playgrounds in Dubai remain closed .
