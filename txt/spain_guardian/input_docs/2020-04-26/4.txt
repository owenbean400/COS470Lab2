Companies in the European Union hit by coronavirus will be able to ask for a government loan of up to 5 % of their 2019 turnover under a new measure proposed by the European Commission , a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday . 
The move comes after several EU countries asked for it , other sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Saturday , declining to provide details .
