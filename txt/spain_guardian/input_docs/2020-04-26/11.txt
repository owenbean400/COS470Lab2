Iran plans to reopen mosques in parts of the country that have been consistently free of the coronavirus outbreak as restrictions on Iranians gradually ease , president Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday . 
Iran , one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the pandemic , will be divided up into white , yellow and red regions based on the number of infections and deaths , Rouhani said , according to the presidency â€™s website . 
Activities in each region will be restricted accordingly , so an area that has been consistently free of infections or deaths will be labelled white and mosques could be reopened and Friday prayers resumed , Reuters reports . 
Iranians have returned to shops , bazaars and parks over the past week as the country eases coronavirus restrictions , with the daily increase in the death toll below 100 since April 14 . 
The toll rose by 60 over the past 24 hours to 5,710 , with 90,481 confirmed cases , Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV on Sunday .
