People from all over the world are writing in every day with new developments and comments for our live coverage on the pandemic , which is hugely appreciated by Guardian reporters trying to provide timely updates from around the globe . 
One thing that has stood out in my inbox over the past two weeks is the amount of emails I receive from Swedish readers . 
Many have expressed frustration about the international coverage of Sweden ’s approach to the coronavirus crisis , pointing out for instance that care home deaths are high in many countries that have imposed strict lockdowns , and insisting that things are not at all " business as usual " in the country . 
To quote one reader from Stockholm who wrote in tonight : " We do not recognise ourselves here at all in your reporting of a totally laissez faire strategy . 
We have clear guidelines - which most people follow with common sense . 
We will have to wait some months to really be able to compare [ Sweden ’s approach with that of other countries ] on even grounds . "
