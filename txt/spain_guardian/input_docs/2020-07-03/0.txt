Spain has suffered 17 more deaths in 24 hours , Agence France Presse has reported . 
It is the country ’s highest daily Covid 19 toll since 19 June . 
The update comes as many Spaniards were gearing up to go on holiday and as the country preparing to reopen its frontiers on Saturday to travellers from 12 other countries outside the European Union . 
Spain had already opened its borders to EU nations on 21 June , as well as residents of the passport free Schengen zone . 
Its neighbour Portugal has said it is " absurd " that the UK is maintaining a quarantine regime for its citizens , despite the latter nation having greater numbers of both cases and deaths . 
The Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva said : We hope that this decision , which seems to us profoundly unfair and wrong , from the British authorities is corrected as soon as possible . 
It is a sad moment in bilateral relations ... because countries that are friends treat each other differently . 
Portugal ’s prime minister tweeted : Which is the safest place to stay ? 
You are welcome to spend a safe holiday in Algarve!#UK # visitportugal
