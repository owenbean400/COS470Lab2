Anthony Fauci , the top infectious disease expert in the US , has had to hire security to protect himself and his family after receiving death threats in response to his work to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
Fauci , a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce , told CNN that the pandemic has brought out " the best of people and the worst of people , and , you know , getting death threats for me and my family and harassing my daughters to the point where I have to get security " . 
Donald Trump â€™s administration has consistently downplayed the public health threat of coronavirus , but Fauci has just as consistently rejected those efforts . 
Since the early days of the pandemic , Fauci has provided blunt assessments of the crisis in media appearances and in remarks at the White House , which have been less frequent in recent months . 
Fauci said : I would not have imagined in my wildest dreams that people who object to things that are pure public health principles are so set against it and do not like what you and I say , namely in the world of science , that they actually threaten you .
