The decision to exclude all but elite runners from this year ’s London Marathon means a gang of veteran participants will miss the chance to complete their 40th race . 
Known as the Ever Present , the group have competed every single year since the world famous event ’s inaugural year in 1981 . 
Starting off as a band of 42 , over the years the Ever Present have been whittled down to just 10 , with same planning to make their 40th marathon their last . 
But now their plans are in disarray and they are still deciding if and how they will be able to take part this year . 
Former primary school head teacher Micheal Peace told the PA news agency : " We are disappointed with the news but in the grand scheme of things there are worse things happening in the world . 
" I think we realised that a mass participation event just was not going to happen at this time of year so it was not a great shock , just a bit of a disappointment . " 
He said the Ever Present were considering taking part in the virtual race , and that some were also considering meeting up to run a 26.2 mile route together . 
Charles Cousens , 78 , from Lowestoft , Suffolk , was unconvinced by the idea of a virtual race conducted via a running app . 
He told PA : " I ’m nearly 80 - I do not even have a watch that tells the time , let alone an app . " 
Cousens , who had been working as a barber right up until shutdown , said : We will just have to go with the flow but after 39 years this was all I needed , this was going to be my last one . 
He said he had not made up his mind whether he would try and take part in the marathon in 2021 , or whether the Ever Present would try and put some kind of event together to mark his final race . 
This year ’s marathon on 4 October will see the world ’s best marathon athletes running an enclosed loop course around St James ’s Park . 
No spectators will be permitted as the runners complete their 19.8 laps of the park , although it will be broadcast by BBC Sport .
