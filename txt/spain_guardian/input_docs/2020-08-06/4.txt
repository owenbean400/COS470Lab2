Alongside transport secretary Grant Shapps ’ announcement that travellers from Belgium , the Bahamas and Andorra will have to self isolate from Saturday , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice to warn against all but essential trips to the three countries . 
Brunei and Malaysia have been added to the government ’s travel corridor list , following a decrease in confirmed cases of coronavirus , meaning arrivals from these countries no longer need to quarantine . 
Figures released on Thursday show Belgium has suffered a consistent increase in cases in recent weeks , rising to 27.8 new cases per 100,000 people . 
This towers over the UK ’s latest rate of 8.4 per 100,000 , and is higher than Spain ’s 27.4 level around the time when the UK introduced travel restrictions there . 
Belgium ’s prime minister , Sophie Wilmes , was last week forced to put a halt to the nation ’s Covid 19 exit plan by introducing drastic new social distancing measures in the hope of avoiding a new national lockdown . 
Contacts outside every household were limited to the same five people for a month , in an effort to curb the spread of the virus . 
In Andorra , new cases per week have increased five fold since mid July , while in the Bahamas the weekly case rate peaked at 78.6 last week , up from 3.1 in the middle of last month . 
The UK ’s move to add Spain onto the quarantine list on 26 July sparked a diplomatic row with the nation and caught out holidaymakers who had already flown over , including Shapps himself . 
It also angered transport bosses who have called for increased testing to reduce the isolation period . 
Luxembourg was added to the UK ’s red list on 31 July . 
Shapps said he " cannot rule out " other countries being included on the list , as officials keep overseas infection rates under close observation . 
The Foreign Office says it keeps its own travel advice " under constant review " .
