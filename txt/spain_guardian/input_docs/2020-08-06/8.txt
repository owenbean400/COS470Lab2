The NHS will be inflicting pain , misery and risk of death on tens of thousands of patients in the UK if it again shuts down normal care when a second wave of Covid 19 hits , doctors ’ and surgeons ’ leaders are warning . 
They are urging NHS bosses not to use the same sweeping closures of services that were introduced in March to help hospitals cope with the huge influx of patients seriously ill with Covid . 
Prof Neil Mortensen , president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England said : The NHS must never again be a Covid only service . 
There is a duty to the thousands of patients waiting in need and in pain to make sure they can be treated . 
The leader of Britain ’s doctors warned that hospitals should not leave patients " stranded " by again suspending a wide range of diagnostic and treatment services . 
Dr Chaand Nagpaul , chair of council at the British Medical Association said : We cannot have a situation in which patients are unable to access diagnostic tests , clinic appointments and treatment which they urgently need and are simply left stranded . 
If someone needs care – for example for cancer , heart trouble , a breathing condition or a neurological problem – they must get it when they need it .
