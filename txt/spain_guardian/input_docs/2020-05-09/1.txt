The novel coronavirus has killed at least 277,127 people since the outbreak first emerged in China last December , according to a tally from official sources compiled by news agency AFP . 
At least 4,001,437 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 195 countries and territories . 
Of these , at least 1,312,900 are now considered recovered . 
The tallies , using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections , as many countries are testing only the most serious cases . 
The US has the highest number of total deaths worldwide at 78,320 , with the UK second highest at 31,587 deaths . 
Italy , Spain and France follow , with China , the home of the virus , recording less than 5000 fatalities .
