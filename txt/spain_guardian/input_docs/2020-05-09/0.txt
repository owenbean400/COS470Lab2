Prof Van Tam is speaking now . 
Transport use remains low and " extremely impressive " , he says . 
There is a gradual increase in the use of motor vehicles , which may reflect people returning to work but is difficult to interpret , he says . 
Daily tests ( both completed and sent out ) have reached " a high plateau " with some fluctuation on a day to day basis , he says . 
Mass swab testing by universities , research institutes and companies is complementing NHS swab testing to record several thousand new cases per day . 
This is reflected in the higher capacity , he says . 
There is " a solid decline " in the number of people in hospital in all the different regions . 
We must still be " cautious and measured about what happens next " , he says . 
There is " plenty of capacity " for critical care patients , the numbers of which continue to decline , he says . 
There has been and continues to be a " steady and consistent fall " in the number of recorded deaths , he says . 
Finally , on the global death comparison , the US is an outlier at the top and the UK is in company with France , Italy and Spain in the middle band . 
We wo not get the most granular picture until we start to get excess mortality data across all countries , he says .
