Dozens of anti lockdown protesters arrested in Berlin , AFP reports . 
German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against . 
About 1,000 people turned out for the rally , which has become a weekly event in the German capital . 
Saturday ’s protest attracted mainly far left activists but there were also right wing supporters and members of other fringe groups . 
Police put up barriers around Rosa Luxemburg square , where the protesters were headed , leaving the participants to gather in nearby roads . 
The protest " is not in line with the rules " in place to prevent the spread of the Covid 19 virus , police said on Twitter , telling those taking part to disperse . 
Some of the demonstrators wore T shirts accusing Chancellor Angela Merkel of " banning life " while others simply called for " freedom " . 
Others brandished placards bearing slogans such as " Stop the pharmaceutical lobby " . 
The protest was unauthorised as a result of emergency rules in Berlin banning gatherings of more than 20 people . 
The protest organisers ’ website called for " an end to the state of emergency " and played down the threat posed by the virus . 
Public discontent with the confinement rules has been growing gradually in Germany , as in other countries , though Merkel ’s popularity remains high . 
She has received plaudits for her management of the health crisis which has seen Germany ’s Covid 19 toll – 5,500 according to an AFP tally – remain significantly lower than in Italy , Spain , France and Britain where the death tolls have all risen above 20,000 . 
Opposition to the lockdown measures is being led by the far right , the main opposition force in the German parliament . 
The far right Alternative for Germany ( Af D ) party accuses the government of exaggerating the risk posed by the virus and has called for the immediate reopening of all businesses .
