Hundreds of British and Irish nationals gathered under white awnings are sat on rows of plastic chairs in a makeshift terminal set up at Lima ’s military airbase known as Grupo Aéreo Ocho , amid emergency workers and soldiers . 
" We ’re all just really happy to be going home , " said Ellie Harper , 32 , who had been marooned in Huacachina , a desert oasis five hours from the Peruvian capital . 
" As hard as it has been to organise and get everything together , from this morning the organisation from the Irish embassy from the UK British embassy has been fantastic . " 
" The staff at the airport have been really lovely and friendly and have explained everything to us really clearly and they ’re working to find ways to get absolutely everybody on board , " she added . 
The first Boeing 777 left with 219 passengers and the second is expected to leave at full capacity taking 275 passengers including one extra stranded traveler , who works as a BA flight attendant and was able to use the drop seat used by the crew . 
" While we ’re very happy to be going home we are mindful that there are still Brits in Peru who need repatriating , " Harper said . 
Nine Britons and one Irish citizen who are staying in the Pariwana Hostel in Cusco have been prevented from joining the repatriation flights . 
Peruvian health authorities say they must remain under quarantine for up to three months along with some 140 fellow guests after two tested positive for Covid 19 on Wednesday . 
" We were treated like we were going to get on a flight today to then find out five hours before we could be here indefinitely , " Siân Forkan , one of the British guests , told The Guardian .
