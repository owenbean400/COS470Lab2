Patients in the UK dying now were infected around a month ago , weeks before the country started social distancing , an expert has warned . 
Professor James Naismith , director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford , spoke out after a further 209 people died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK . 
Although this is a lower number than the 260 deaths the previous day , he warned it is too early to draw conclusions , underlining that " daily numbers can be lower ( or higher ) than expected due to random factors " . 
Prof Naismith said : " I am confident that provided we follow social distancing the increase in deaths will stop and this will be followed by a decrease in the daily numbers . 
" It can take up to two weeks from infection to onset of symptoms . 
For over 80 % of people these symptoms are mild , for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness , intensive care is needed around 10 days later . 
" For those who do not recover but die , data from China suggests this takes around another four days . 
The tragic deaths today will be from people infected roughly a month ago . 
It is inevitable that there will be more tragedies for families ahead . 
" We can reduce the final death toll only by following current Government advice . 
We must expect and welcome changes in Government advice as science , medicine and social science work together to learn more . "
