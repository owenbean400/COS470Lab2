Hundreds of worshippers attended services at a Louisiana church on Sunday , flouting a ban on large gatherings , angering neighbours and seemingly turning a deaf ear to their governor , who once again warned that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with new cases of the coronavirus , AP reports . 
An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the mustard yellow and beige Life Tabernacle church in Central , a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton Rouge . 
Assistant ministers and worshippers who stood outside the front doors and in the parking lot of Life Tabernacle told news reporters to leave , saying cameras would not be allowed on the property and they had been told not to talk to the news media .
