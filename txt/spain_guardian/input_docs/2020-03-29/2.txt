Egyptian banks have been ordered to apply temporary caps on daily withdrawals and deposits , a policy that some analysts see as an attempt to control inflation and hoarding in the midst of the pandemic . 
The daily limit for individuals would be 10,000 Egyptian pounds and 50,000 pounds for companies , according to Reuters . 
This follows Zimbabwe legalising the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions in preparation for the country â€™s 21 day lockdown .
