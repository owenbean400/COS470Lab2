A British consortium formed by a group of aerospace , automotive and engineering firms to build ventilators for the country ’s health service during the pandemic said on Sunday it would end after delivering over 13,000 devices . 
Ventilator Challenge UK said its production had more than doubled the stock of ventilators available for use in the National Health Service ( NHS ) . 
The consortium , which was formed on a not for profit basis by the likes of Ford , Mc Laren , Rolls Royce and Airbus , said in May it was ramping up production in case of a second peak in infections . 
But Dick Elsy , Chairman of Ventilator Challenge UK , said the NHS was now well placed for the future . 
" We have helped ensure the NHS has always had access to the number of ventilators it needs , and we ’re pleased to have also contributed to building a resilient stock should ventilators be required in the UK in the future , " he said , Reuters reports . 
Britain sought to " protect the NHS " during its coronavirus lockdown by working to flatten the curve of infections so the health service was not overwhelmed . 
The availability of ventilators in the NHS had been a hot political topic as the epidemic started , but the demand for the machines never got close to the 30,000 figures initially estimated as being required . 
The government has said that everyone who needed a ventilator during the pandemic has had access to one .
