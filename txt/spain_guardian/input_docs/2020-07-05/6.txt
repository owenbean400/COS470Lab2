A Canadian military plane headed to Latvia for a NATO mission was forced to turn around for fear that troops on board had been exposed to the coronavirus , the Defense Department said . 
The decision was made after the Canadian army learned that someone on the Trenton military base in Ontario , where the plane took off Thursday , had tested positive for Covid 19 , according to department spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande . 
The person in question could have come in contact with the 70 passengers and crew members on the plane , she said . 
" The health and well being of our members , and that of our Allies and partners in Latvia , is a priority , " Lamirande told AFP on Sunday . 
" As such , the decision was made to return the aircraft en route , rather than land in Latvia , to avoid the possible risk of spreading the disease . " 
The soldiers will quarantine for 14 days at the Trenton base before being redeployed , Lamirande added , noting that the incident will not have any major effect on Canada â€™s mission in Latvia . 
Canada has about 540 soldiers deployed in Latvia , where the North American nation has been leading a NATO battle group since 2017 .
