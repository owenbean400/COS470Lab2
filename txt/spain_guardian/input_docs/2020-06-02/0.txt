UK ministers have been accused of not taking seriously the threat posed to black , Asian and minority ethnic ( BAME ) Britons by Covid 19 , after it was reported that the release of an official review of the issue had been delayed over fears of potential civil unrest . 
According to Sky News , officials are concerned about the effect the publication could have amid global anger over the death of George Floyd , an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck . 
Citing an unnamed government source , Sky said the release of the Public Health England ( PHE ) review , due by the end of May , had been pushed back yet further because of " worries " around " current global events " . 
The source was quoted as saying there were concerns in Whitehall about the " close proximity to the current situation in America " , where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people . 
The source reportedly said it would be a " bad combination " if the review was released amid such tensions . 
De Cordova added : " There is a gross irony in delaying the release of a report into the unequal suffering of the BAME community , on the basis of global events that relate to the suffering of black communities around the world .
