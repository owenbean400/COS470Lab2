A nationwide study of more than 60,000 people in Spain suggests about 5 % of the population – approximately 2 million people – have had the virus . 
According to the provisional results of tests designed by the health ministry and the Carlos III public health institute , 5 % of those tested had produced antibodies . 
While the prevalence of the antibodies was similar in men and women , it was lower in children and babies . 
There were also significant regional variations : while Murcia , Melilla , Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2 % , the proportion rose to more than 10 % in the regions of Madrid and Castilla La Mancha . 
As the health minister Salvador Illa made plain on Wednesday evening , the study shows herd immunity has not been achieved .
