Spain plans to extend until the end of the year a measure preventing employers from using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to fire staff , a source with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday . 
The government approved measures in March to prevent employers using Covid 19 as a reason to dismiss employees while the health crisis lasted . 
Ministers are currently negotiating with unions and business groups to extend a furlough scheme , known as ERTE , beyond September when it was due to expire . 
As part of these negotiations , the government is proposing to extend the ban on dismissing staff because of Covid 19 until the end of 2020 , the source said , according to Reuters . 
Currently , there are about 800,000 workers in Spain who are on the furlough scheme , compared to 2.5 million when the government declared a state of emergency in March . 
Spain reported 4,708 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours on Friday , bringing its cumulative total to 566,326 â€“ the highest in western Europe . 
A government official declined to comment .
