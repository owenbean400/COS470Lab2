EU states hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic will have to wait longer for € 750bn meant to help restart their economies , a senior diplomat said , as a fresh rise in Covid 19 infections shuts down business on the continent again . 
Last July , EU leaders agreed a landmark stimulus to top up their € 1tn joint budget for 2021-27 to revive economic growth ravaged by the pandemic . 
But the plan must still be ratified by the bloc ’s parliament , where some lawmakers want more spending . 
" It will not be possible anymore to have the EU budget and the recovery fund in place by 1 January , " said the EU diplomat in negotiations with lawmakers , Reuters reports . 
The plan to lift Europe ’s economy from its deepest ever recession caused by the Covid 19 pandemic must also be ratified by some member states ’ national parliaments . 
" Even if an agreement would be struck within the next 14 days ... ratification in member states will take between two and a half and three months . 
And this is the most positive scenario . 
So we are facing delays , " said the diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity . 
If approved , the stimulus scheme would be a mix of repayable loans and grants , crucial to countries such as Spain or Italy where economies suffered badly from the pandemic but governments have little room to spend due to high debt . 
While the money to help businesses climb out of Europe ’s spring coronavirus lockdown is now not expected to start flowing before mid 2021 , a second wave of infection is now pushing the continent into tighter restrictions on daily lives . 
Just this week , France has extended curfews to around two thirds of its population and Spain is considering similar action , while Poland started turning its national soccer stadium in Warsaw into a field hospital .
