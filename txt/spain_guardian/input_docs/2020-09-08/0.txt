The CEOs of nine companies developing vaccines against Covid 19 have pledged to " uphold the integrity of the scientific process " amid concern Donald Trump will pressure regulators to approve a vaccine ahead of the presidential election in November . 
" We , the undersigned biopharmaceutical companies , want to make clear our ongoing commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for Covid 19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles , " said the CEOs . 
The statement was signed by Astra Zeneca , Bio NTech , Glaxo Smith Kline , Johnson & amp ; 
Johnson , Merck , Moderna , Novavax , Pfizer and Sanofi . 
Specifically , the companies said they would only seek emergency authorisations for vaccines " after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA , " the Food and Drug Administration . 
Joe Biden , the Democratic candidate for president , has accused Trump of " undermining public confidence " by regularly raising the possibility a vaccine will be ready ahead of the election on 3 November . 
Stephen Hahn , the head of the FDA , has also guaranteed that only science will decide when a vaccine is ready . 
In theory , the FDA has to rely on independent expert committees that oversee clinical trials before they give their green light . 
The makers themselves must also apply for authorisation . 
Among the companies , Moderna and Pfizer are in the most advanced stages of their trials , and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has asked states to have distribution networks ready by 1 November .
