Jordanian authorities confirmed the first two cases of coronavirus in a refugee camp hosting Syrian refugees since the pandemic was first reported in the kingdom , the UN refugee agency has said . 
The two Syrians , who were transferred to an isolation site , tested positive during random testing done by Jordanian health authorities in the Azraq camp , said Rula Amin , UNHCR spokeswoman for the Middle East and north Africa . 
There have been several other infections of Syrian refugees living outside the camps , among around 2,500 cases in Jordan since the first was reported on 2 March , Amin said . 
Most of the 655,000 United Nations registered Syrian refugees live in urban centres . 
A majority of Syrian refugees who fled their homeland since the start of the nearly decade long conflict in 2011 have remained in Jordan .
