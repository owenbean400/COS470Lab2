Health authorities in Spain are worried about an uptick in coronavirus cases following a string of recent bank holidays and the relaxing of measures by some regions , health minister Salvador Illa said . 
" The situation is doubly preoccupying : we ’re seeing ( cases ) increase , without having even reached Christmas , and without having fully registered the effects of the bank holidays , " Illa said at a press conference . 
Covid 19 incidence in Spain crept up to 201 cases per 100,000 inhabitants on Wednesday , after staying below that mark for the past seven days , while health authorities recorded 11,078 new cases and 195 deaths in the past 24 hours . 
Spain will now allow regions to tighten anti coronavirus measures as part of its Christmas plan , meaning gatherings could be limited to six people , curfews could be lengthened , and travel between regions banned . 
Health emergency coordinator Fernando Simón will on Thursday present an analysis of the impact which several bank holiday weekends , and a loosening of measures in some regions , have had on the epidemiological situation .
