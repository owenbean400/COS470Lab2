Canada has announced an agreement to receive early deliveries of the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine after a surge of new cases is forcing additional health restrictions across the country . 
" Canada is now contracted to receive up to 168,000 doses of the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine before the end of December , pending Health Canada approval , " the prime minister , Justin Trudeau , said in a news conference . 
Earlier this month , Canada brought forward some deliveries of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine , which received regulatory approval last week . 
Before these agreements , the first deliveries had been expected early next year . 
" We have now confirmed that next week we will receive about 200,000 of our total early order of doses from Pfizer , " he added . 
Moderna ’s vaccine is under review by Canada ’s drug regulator , and Trudeau said its approval could come as early as next week . 
The provinces of Alberta , Saskatchewan and British Columbia were poised to make their first vaccinations on Tuesday , and some 100 frontline healthcare workers were due to get shots in Ottawa , the capital , by the end of the day . 
Several provinces have clamped down again on businesses and social gatherings during the second wave , and Quebec – the hardest hit province – is expected to announce new business restrictions later on Tuesday . 
Canada has so far reported 468,862 cases , with 6,731 new ones on Monday , and 13,553 deaths . 
Health officials warned last week the country could see 12,000 new cases per day by January without new restrictions . 
The country ’s economic recovery from the pandemic is at a very difficult stage and a second wave of coronavirus infections " could even deepen the economic hole " , Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem said on Tuesday .
