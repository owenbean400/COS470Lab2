Moderna said its experimental Covid 19 vaccine induced immune responses in older adults similar to those in younger participants , offering hope it will be effective in people considered to be at high risk for severe complications from the virus . 
The company is one of the leading contenders in the race to develop a vaccine against the virus that has killed more than 820,000 people worldwide . 
Its candidate , m RNA 1273 , is already in late stage human trials testing its ability to safely prevent infection . 
Moderna said the immune responses in those aged between ages 56 and 70 , above age 70 and those 18 to 55 years old were similar . 
Health officials have been concerned about whether vaccine candidates would work in older people , whose immune systems typically do not respond as strongly to vaccines . 
The company has so far enrolled over 13,000 participants in its late stage study . 
About 18 % of the total participants are Black , Latino , Native American or Alaska Native , groups that have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic , and are often under represented in clinical trials . 
Dr Jacqueline Miller , Moderna â€™s head of infectious disease development , said the company plans to post weekly updates on enrolment of Black and Latino trial subjects on its website . 
Pfizer told Reuters last week that 19 % of the 11,000 subjects already enrolled in its vaccine trial are Black or Latino .
