Brazil ’s health ministry expects to have at least 150m doses of vaccines against Covid 19 available in the first half of 2021 , with a third or more coming from a Chinese company despite the president ’s early scepticism . 
Arnaldo Medeiros , a health ministry official , also told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that an initial deal to acquire 46m doses of vaccine developed by China ’s Sinovac Biotech could soon be expanded to 100m . 
The Sao Paulo state government ’s Butantan Institute is expected to present data from its late stage trial of the Sinovac vaccine , Corona Vac , on Wednesday , which has already begun rolling off its fill and finish production line . 
President Jair Bolsonaro had snubbed that vaccine , citing doubts about its " origin " and trading barbs with Sao Paulo governor João Doria , a political rival . 
But the health ministry has been eager to secure supplies as the global rush for vaccines heats up . 
The federal government ’s Fiocruz biomedical centre is also expected to begin fill and finish of the Astra Zeneca vaccine in coming months , delivering the first shots on 8 February . 
The ministry expects 104m doses by June , officials said . 
Separately , the ministry is in talks with Pfizer to receive 8m doses of the vaccine it developed with Germany ’s Bio NTech in the first half of 2021 . 
No Covid 19 vaccine has been approved yet for use in Brazil . 
The Pfizer/Bio NTech shot has been authorised in several countries , including the US , the UK and Canada . 
Bolsonaro , who has repeatedly played down the severity of the pandemic , has said he will not take any vaccine , stoking broader scepticism toward the shots among Brazilians . 
Brazil ’s public health authorities , however , have said they will use any vaccine approved by regulators . 
On Tuesday Brazil registered 55,202 new cases of coronavirus , bringing the total to 7,318,821 . 
Deaths rose by 968 to 188,259 .
