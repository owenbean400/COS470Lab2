More than 500,000 people who have been vaccinated against Covid 19 will have their second dose delayed for up to 12 weeks as the NHS rethinks the rollout that is aimed at halting the surging death toll in the UK . 
In a change of policy , applying across the UK , the NHS will now prioritise administering to as many people on the priority list as possible the first dose of either the newly approved Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine or the Pfizer/Bio NTech jab , so as to maximise the number of people protected against the disease . 
Recipients will still get the two doses required to confer full immunity , but now the second will be delayed , in most cases coming 11 to 12 weeks after the first . 
Previously , those receiving the Pfizer jab had a second dose date set three weeks later on from their first dose . 
That gap was originally expected to be four weeks for the Oxford vaccination .
