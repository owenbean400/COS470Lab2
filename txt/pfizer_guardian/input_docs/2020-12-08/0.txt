Canada is confident there will be no disruption of Covid 19 vaccine supplies even if the United States blocks their export because vaccines are manufactured in several countries , a minister said . 
This comes ahead of an expected US executive order meant to ensure Americans ’ priority access to the shots . 
President Donald Trump ’s executive order is intended to ensure priority access for Covid 19 vaccines procured by the US government , ahead of other nations , senior administration officials said on Monday . 
Asked about the impact of any executive order on those deliveries at a media briefing , a Canadian minister said Canada ’s purchases are not tied to any one manufacturing site , and noted that Pfizer Inc is manufacturing in Europe as well as the United States . 
" We ’re very confident that Pfizer and other vaccine makers that are contractually obligated to deliver vaccine doses to Canada will be able to meet those obligations , " said Dominic Le Blanc , minister of intergovernmental affairs .
