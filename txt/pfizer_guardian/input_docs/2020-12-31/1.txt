The World Health Organization has listed the Covid 19 vaccine from Pfizer and Bio NTech for emergency use , saying the move opens the door for countries to expedite their own approvals to import and give the shot . 
Dr Mariangela Simao , WHO assistant director general for Access to Medicines and Health Products , said : This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to Covid 19 vaccines . 
But I want to emphasise the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere . 
The Pfizer/Bio NTech # COVID19 vaccine today became the first vaccine to receive WHO validation for emergency use since the outbreak began . 
Equitable global access to vaccines is crucial to combat the pandemic . ðŸ‘‰ The WHO , together with the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , are spearheading a global effort called COVAX to distribute vaccines to low - and middle income countries , to help make sure that shots do not go only to wealthy nations . 
The COVAX alliance has said it has agreements for nearly 2bn doses , with first deliveries due in early 2021 . 
The alliance has said it has been in talks with Pfizer and Bio NTech to secure its vaccine . 
Pfizer/Bio NTech â€™s messenger RNA vaccine was 95 % effective at preventing disease symptoms after two doses 21 days apart . 
Delivery is challenging , since it needs to be stored at - 70C . 
The vaccine has previously been approved for emergency use in the US and Britain , and has conditional marketing approval in the EU and Switzerland , among other countries , where distribution of shots concentrating on older people and healthcare workers began in December .
