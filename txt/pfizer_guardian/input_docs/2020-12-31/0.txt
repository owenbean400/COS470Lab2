The UK â€™s chief medical officers have defended plans to delay giving the second dose of a Covid vaccine to more than 500,000 people who have received the first jab after an outcry among doctors . 
Recipients of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine had previously been told there would be a three week gap between doses , with many already booked in for their second jab . 
But the government announced a change to its Covid vaccination strategy on Wednesday , saying second doses of the newly approved Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine and the previously approved Pfizer/Bio NTech jab would now be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose . 
The move applies to people scheduled to have their second dose of the Pfizer jab after 4 January , as well as those yet to receive either jab . 
The government said it hoped the approach would mean as many people as possible would soon have some protection against the disease . 
The new regime was backed by the chief medical officers of the four UK nations , with instructions given to health service leaders in England by NHS bosses on Wednesday to postpone many of the scheduled second Pfizer/Bio NTech jabs . 
The announcement caused controversy , however . 
Pfizer and Bio NTech warned that two doses of their vaccine were required for maximum protection against Covid and that they did not have evidence that the first dose alone offered protection after three weeks .
