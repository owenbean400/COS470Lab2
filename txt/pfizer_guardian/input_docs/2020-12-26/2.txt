Israel ’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country is hoping to vaccinate a quarter of its population against coronavirus within a month in order to return to post pandemic normalcy . 
" I spoke over the weekend with the heads of the companies that are providing us with the vaccines and I told them that our goal by next weekend is to reach 150,000 vaccines a day , " Netanyahu said in a video . 
" This means that within 30 days of reaching this pace we will have administered 4.5 million vaccinations , " he said . 
" Since everyone needs two injections , after one month we will have vaccinated 2.25 million Israeli citizens . " 
Netanyahu was the first Israeli to receive a Covid 19 jab on 19 December , ahead of the launch on Monday of a nationwide innoculation programme . 
By Friday morning 210,000 people had received a first dose of the vaccine developped by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner Bio NTech . 
Netanyahu said he hopes the vaccination drive will help Israel " emerge from the coronavirus " allowing it to re open its economy " and do things that no country can do " . 
His comments came as Israel prepared to start on Sunday a nationwide two week lockdown – its third since the pandemic started earlier this year – after a sharp rebound in the infection rate .
