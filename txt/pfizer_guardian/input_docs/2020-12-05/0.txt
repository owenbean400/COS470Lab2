The British health secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday that the coronavirus vaccine could bring the loosening of restrictions before the end of March . 
In an interview with the Telegraph , Matt Hancock said he " ca not wait [...] to get back to living by mutual respect and personal responsibility , not laws set in Parliament".It marks a change in rhetoric and tone from Hancock , who until now has been regarded as one of the British government ’s strongest proponents of the strictest possible measures . 
He added : " There ’s no doubt that having the vaccine early ... will bring forward the moment when we can get rid of these blasted restrictions , but until then we have got to follow them . 
Help is on its way."The first vaccinations were being shipped to 50 locations around the UK this weekend , and millions of vaccine doses from Pfizer will be available in the country before the end of the year . 
The government hopes to vaccinate more than half of the vulnerable people who need a jab by the end of February .
