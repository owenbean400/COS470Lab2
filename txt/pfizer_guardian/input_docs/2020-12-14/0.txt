A mass inoculation campaign against Covid 19 in Brazil will only be possible from March and will rely on the Astra Zeneca vaccine , a senior health official told Reuters . 
The comments come as a fresh wave of coronavirus infections devastates Brazil , which has the world ’s second highest death toll from the pandemic with over 180,000 dead , behind only the US . 
As Britain and the United States begin immunisations using the shot developed by Pfizer , pressure is mounting on Brazil ’s health ministry to quickly make a vaccine available amid criticism the government did not secure a diverse enough supply of potential candidates . 
It ’s not a 100 metre sprint , " said Marco Krieger , vice president of health production and innovation at the Fiocruz institute . 
" We at Fiocruz are prepared for a marathon . " 
Krieger said the Rio de Janeiro based institute , which has a deal to produce the Astra Zeneca shot , expects to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of 2021 and another 110 million doses in the second half . 
That timeframe depends on approval from the health regulator Anvisa .
