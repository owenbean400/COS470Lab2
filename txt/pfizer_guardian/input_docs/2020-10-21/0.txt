The US is likely to have enough safe and effective Covid 19 vaccines available to inoculate the most vulnerable Americans by the end of 2020 , health and human services secretary Alex Azar said . 
The US government is " cautiously optimistic " that one or two vaccines , likely from Pfizer or Moderna , will be available by the end of the year and can begin to be distributed to Americans , officials said during a news conference . 
Azar said he expects all seniors , healthcare workers , and first responders will be able to receive a vaccine as soon as January , with the rest of the American public able to get a vaccine by April . 
Companies participating in the US government â€™s effort to develop a vaccine for Covid 19 , dubbed Operation Warp Speed , have begun developing manufacturing capabilities even before any vaccinations have been authorised by regulators . 
In an open letter published last week , Pfizer said it is unlikely to have enough data to submit for a US regulatory authorisation until late November , after the US presidential election . 
The coronavirus outbreak has been worsening in recent weeks as cold weather pushes Americans indoors , raising the chance of contracting the virus . 
Some 38 US states and two territories have reported rising case counts .
