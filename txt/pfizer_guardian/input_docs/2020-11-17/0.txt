Plans for vaccination programmes began taking shape in Europe and the United States following recent breakthroughs , but surging coronavirus caseloads prompted gruelling new restrictions , with Austria taking the unpopular step Tuesday of closing schools and shops . 
Global hopes of beating the pandemic were high after US biotech firm Moderna said its vaccine candidate was nearly 95 % effective in a trial , a week after similar results announced by pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner Bio NTech . 
Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci hailed the results , telling AFP that the data exceeded expectations . 
" The idea that we have a 94.5 % effective vaccine is stunningly impressive , " he said . 
Moderna , whose clinical trial involved more than 30,000 participants , expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the United States by year end - with elderly and other at risk people to be first in line for jabs .
