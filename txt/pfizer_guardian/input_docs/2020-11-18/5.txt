Uruguay is starting to see a worrying rise in cases , sparking concern among government officials that the country could reverse course after a long period of containing the pandemic . 
The South American nation has confirmed just 4,208 positive cases and 68 deaths since the pandemic began , with voluntary quarantines , widespread tracing programs and random testing helping keep infection rates far lower than its South American neighbors . 
However , cases have jumped in the last month , crossing 100 daily cases for the first time . 
Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou has now opted for a government campaign to promote " responsible freedom , " with officials targeting young people ahead of the tourist season , calling on them to limit social gatherings and not share drinks . 
" The health authorities make a special request to the population to reduce the circles of social contact and meeting times , the permanent use of face masks , physical distancing , ventilation and hygiene , " Uruguay ’s national emergency system said . 
Officials in the capital , Montevideo , where there are currently 449 active cases , are considering suspending celebrations for carnival , the country ’s major festival set to begin in January . 
Health Ministry officials have asked laboratories to increase their analysis capacity for coronavirus testing , potentially doubling the current rate of about 4,000 test per day if cases continue to rise .
