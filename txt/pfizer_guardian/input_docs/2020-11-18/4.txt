Canada is in talks with other governments about a plan to donate coronavirus vaccine shots to lower income countries , sources told Reuters . 
Canada has made deals to buy more doses per capita than any other nation , according to researchers at the Duke Global Health Innovation Center in North Carolina . 
It is among a handful of wealthy nations that reserved billions of doses between them before late stage trial data came in , ensuring they would get access even if only one or two vaccines worked . 
Canada could donate extra doses through the World Health Organization backed COVAX facility , which would distribute them among recipient countries , said a Canadian government source . 
Separately , a COVAX source confirmed discussions were going on between Canada and other governments and organizations involved with COVAX , a facility created to ensure equitable access to COVID 19 vaccines . 
Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential . 
Asked about the issue in a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday , Deputy Procurement Minister Bill Matthews said Canada " would have options " if all seven suppliers had their vaccines approved but that it was " too early " for a plan .
