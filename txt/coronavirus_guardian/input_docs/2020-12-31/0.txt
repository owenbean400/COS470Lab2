A holiday season uptick in coronavirus infections will give Colombia a rocky start to 2021 , health minister Fernando Ruiz said , while doctors called for quarantines in hard hit areas . 
" We ’re going to have difficulties in the first two weeks of January , " Ruiz said during an interview with Colombia ’s Caracol Radio , where he attributed growth in coronavirus cases to people mixing over the festive season . 
The country has reported more than 1.6 million cases of coronavirus and close to 43,000 deaths . 
The number of active cases stands at more than 80,000 , according to the health ministry . 
Coronavirus cases in Colombia have ticked upwards over the holidays with an all time high of 14,941 new cases reported on 25 December , the last of four new daily infection records reported in seven days . 
" We ’re seeing very important growth in cases following relaxation of ( biosecurity ) measures , especially in December , " Ruiz said . 
Rising infection numbers have prompted authorities in some cities to declare curfews , bans on alcohol sales , and limits to when people can shop - based on their national identity number - over the holiday period . 
However , current restrictions might not be enough and the government should again impose mandatory isolation measures in areas with high levels of coronavirus cases , Dr Tatiana Espinosa , president of the Colombian Association of Internal Medicine ( ACMI ) , told Reuters . 
On Wednesday the ACMI issued an open letter calling on authorities to implement measures to help slow the spread of the disease . 
" We agree there should be a new period of isolation , for at least two weeks , " Espinosa said , adding authorities would need to decide if such measures were performed nationally or just in the most affected regions . 
" We cannot throw away everything we have previously achieved , " she said .
