A group of 14 doctors in France called on Saturday for stricter rules on the wearing of masks to ensure there was no resurgence of the coronavirus , Agence France Presse reports . 
In an open letter published in the daily newspaper Le Parisien Aujourd ’hui , the doctors , from a range of disciplines , noted that people were beginning to neglect the basic social distancing precautions . 
" It would be most unfortunate if these effective and accessible methods were not used , " they added . 
They recommended the compulsory wearing of masks inside public buildings , social distancing as much as possible and the regular washing of hands . 
While acknowledging that masks could be uncomfortable to wear , they insisted on their importance . 
" Wearing a mask is not only to protect yourself , but also to prevent the spread of the virus ; as long as everyone wears it , " they wrote . 
Their message echoed Friday ’s appeal by the prime minister , Jean Castex , and the health minister , Olivier Veran , as the first wave of holidaymakers prepared to set off this weekend . 
They called on people to stay vigilant and to keep wearing masks to avoid a second wave of the coronavirus . 
France ’s health authority noted on Friday that the level of infections had begun to pick up again even if , for the moment , the numbers remained low . 
France ’s total Covid 19 death toll rose above 30,000 on Friday .
