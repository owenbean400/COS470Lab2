Coronavirus lockdowns in Europe have led to some environmental improvements such as better air quality and lower carbon emissions , but they are temporary and coupled with a surge in single use plastic , the European Environment Agency ( EEA ) said on Thursday . 
The pandemic is ravaging Europe , which has now become the global region with the most Covid 19 infections , and governments in the UK , France , Italy and elsewhere are ramping up measures to stop the spread . 
The Copenhagen based EEA said in a statement that lockdowns in European countries " may have some direct , short term , positive impacts on our environment , especially in terms of emissions and air quality , although these are likely to be temporary . " 
The EU agency said its data showed that the concentration of nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , a gas emitted mainly from vehicles which can cause inflammation of the respiratory system , fell sharply in countries where lockdowns were imposed in the spring of 2020 . 
The concentration of NO2 fell by 61 percent in Spain , 52 in France and 48 percent in Italy , all countries which had strict lockdowns , the EEA said . 
Noise pollution also fell significantly . 
But the pandemic has also brought about a significant spike in plastic consumption , as demand for protective gear like masks , gloves and hand sanitiser soared . 
Restaurants forced to only offer takeaway have used single use plastic containers , while increased online shopping has also contributed to the problem . 
The statement said : The upsurge in demand for these items may challenge EU efforts to curb plastic pollution and move towards a more sustainable and circular plastics system . 
The pandemic has also led to a sharp drop in oil prices , making it cheaper for manufacturers to use oil rather than recycled material to make plastic , it added .
