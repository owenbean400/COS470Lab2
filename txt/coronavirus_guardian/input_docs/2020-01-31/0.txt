We ’re just hearing a news conference in Queensland that as of Thursday , coronavirus has been declared notifiable disease . 
" That means on clinical suspicion , any doctor or hospital that sees a patient that they think might have this novel coronavirus is obliged to let me know . 
They let my staff know , " says Queensland ’s chief medical officer , Dr Jeanette Young . 
As I wrote in the blog a short time ago , Queensland authorities have been trying to track down passengers on a plane that flew from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on 27 January , as there was a tourist from Wuhan onboard who was later diagnoses with coronavirus . 
He was travelling with a party of eight other people . 
" We are contact tracing of course the people immediately adjacent to these people on the plane , on that Tiger flight and then we ’re giving information to everyone else who was on the plane and the Tiger people have been extremely supportive and cooperative , so that we could do that , plus we need to go through in detail everyone who ’s been at the hotel these people were staying at , " Young said .
