Coronavirus is spreading fast through Brazil ’s indigenous populations with deaths caused by the disease increasing more than five fold in the past month , according to data . 
Many epidemiologists had hoped remote locations might protect the tribes , but the virus , which first took hold in state capitals of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , is increasingly devastating these far flung communities where basic healthcare is often precarious . 
Deaths among Brazil ’s indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1 , from 28 at the end of April , according to the Articulation of Brazil ’s Indigenous Peoples ( APIB ) , a national umbrella association that brings together the country ’s 305 tribes . 
In the village of Sororó in southeastern Pará , tribesman Itamaré Suruí said one elder had died and people were falling ill but the government had not provided tests to confirm whether they have COVID 19 .
