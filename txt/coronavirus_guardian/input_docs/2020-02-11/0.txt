The new coronavirus has been named Covid 19 by the director general of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
The WHO chief , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , told a press conference a name was chosen that " did not refer to a geographical location , an animal , an individual or group of people , and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease " . 
He said : Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising . 
It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks . 
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses , responsible for the Sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) outbreak in 2002-03 , and Mers ( Middle East respiratory syndrome ) . 
The current novel coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan , China , had remained unnamed until today . 
Some coronaviruses cause serious illness , while others cause mild or moderate infections , like the common cold .
