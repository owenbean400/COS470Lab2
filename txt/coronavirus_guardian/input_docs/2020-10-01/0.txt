Coronavirus cases have doubled in the majority of English cities and towns that are subject to long term local lockdowns , Guardian analysis has found , amid growing concern that restrictions are confusing and done " on the cheap " . 
In 11 out of 16 English cities and towns where restrictions were imposed nine weeks ago , the infection rate has at least doubled , with cases in five areas of Greater Manchester rising faster than the England average in that time . 
In Wigan , cases have risen from seven per 100,000 residents to 102 in that period . 
Leicester is the only one of the 16 areas to record fewer cases than when the measures were implemented . 
The findings will raise concerns after Prof Chris Whitty , the chief medical officer for England , said the government â€™s strategy was to limit the virus to regional hotspots . 
" If everybody follows the guidance , then we could actually contain it within the areas it is [ now ] in the way that happened to some degree in Italy and Spain , " he said at a press conference on Wednesday .
