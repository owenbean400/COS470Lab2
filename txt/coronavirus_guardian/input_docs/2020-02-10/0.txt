A UK law firm that specialises in private education has said independent schools should discourage students from flying to China and consider keeping their boarding house open and staffed during the half term break . 
Vicky Wilson , Senior Associate in the Education practice at Wilsons , said : Pupils from China and Hong Kong make up the biggest single group of overseas student in the UK â€™s independent schools . 
Coronavirus is something every school must address this week . 
The Foreign Office has advised people in the UK to avoid all but essential travel to China and independent schools must reinforce that to pupils and their families . 
Missing a family reunion is hard on everyone but it is preferable to pupils risking their education being seriously disrupted by Coronavirus and its fallout . 
Wilsons Solicitors have listed six things all independent schools should be doing ahead of the holiday .
