Coronavirus has swept through Milan ’s prestigious La Scala opera house , with 18 singers and nine musicians testing positive for the disease , an official said . 
All the members of the chorus were in quarantine along with the wind section of the orchestra , while the theatre awaited results from tests of other staff members . 
" All rehearsals have been suspended , " Paolo Puglisi , a union representative at La Scala told reporters . 
La Scala reopened in July after being shut for four months during Italy ’s first wave of Covid 19 . 
This week , public performances were again suspended because of a government decree issued on Sunday that shut down theatres and cinemas across Italy in an effort to contain a resurgence of infections . 
The closure order expires on 24 November and Puglisi said the musicians and singers had hoped the opera house would be in a position to stage its traditional performance marking the start of a new season on 7 December , a highlight of Italy ’s cultural life . 
Milan and the surrounding Lombardy region have been particularly hard hit by the virus , registering a record 7,558 new cases on Wednesday . 
The next worst affected area in Italy was the neighbouring Piedmont region with 2,827 cases .
