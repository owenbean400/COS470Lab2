On Tuesday , Campania governor Vincenzo De Luca said he has planned to introduce a night time curfew from this weekend ( see 1.52pm . ) . 
De Luca said he has spoken to the interior minister , Luciana Lamorgese , and that she has agreed to send 100 soldiers which will be used to help control the territory and enforce Covid rules . 
Coronavirus cases in Campania are rising rapidly , as hospitals in the southern regions are bracing themselves . 
Compared with better equipped hospitals in the richer north , there are fears that those in the south will struggle to cope with an escalation in cases . 
The health system in the south has been blighted by cost cutting , and more than 40 hospitals have closed in recent years . 
The mayor of Naples , Luigi de Magistris , said Campania risked returning to a rigid lockdown because the virus was " out of control " . 
" We have just 15 intensive care beds left , " he told state broadcaster RAI in a radio interview on Tuesday .
