Police in the Australian state of Victoria plan to use drones to ensure that members of the public are following social distancing rules during the Australian Football League ( AFL ) Grand Final on Saturday . 
The game , between Victoria based clubs Geelong and Richmond , will take place at The Gabba in Brisbane , Queensland and is expected to host a 30,000 crowd , according to the AFL 's official website . 
The AFL final is one of the most watched televised sporting events in the country . 
Victoria is easing lockdown measures that were put in place to stop the spread of Covid 19 , but indoor gatherings are still banned in Melbourne , the state 's biggest city . 
No more than two households , up to 10 people , can gather outdoors in public spaces . 
Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius of Victoria Police said drones give authorities " a real time appreciation of crowd numbers , crowd behavior . " 
The annual AFL grand final is traditionally played in Melbourne on the last Saturday of September but was moved this year to Brisbane -- more than 1,000 miles away -- because of the pandemic .
