In Australia , previously mundane chores are being turned into a fun public outing in the midst of self isolation . 
Just scroll down the Bin Isolation Outing Facebook group to see . 
Originally begun as a joke between friends , the page now has half a million members and counting -- and is filled with photos and videos of folks around Australia ( and , increasingly , the world ) taking their bins to the curb in fun costumes . 
Danielle Askew created the page two weeks ago , after a friend jokingly wrote on Facebook that she was excited to take the bin out because it gave her a reason to leave the house . 
So Askew , who lives in Hervey Bay , Australia , dared her to get dressed up for it . 
She did , as did Askew , who then started the Facebook page as a way to have a laugh with her friend group . 
But that page quickly went beyond the group and Australia , reaching folks as far away as the US . 
What was supposed to be a private joke has turned into a source of joy for people everywhere , as more and more people find themselves stuck inside .
