Singapore is lifting its border restrictions for Mainland China and Australia 's Victoria State beginning November 6 . 
Singapore 's Civil Aviation Authority ( CAAS ) said on Thursday that visitors from these countries can apply for an " Air Travel Pass ( ATP ) " granting entry into Singapore as long as they 've stayed in either Mainland China or Victoria State for 14 days prior to entry . 
Visitors will be required to take a Covid 19 test after arriving at the airport , but will not need to serve a Stay Home Notice . 
" This latest initiative follows the earlier lifting of border restrictions for visitors from Australia ( excluding Victoria State ) , Brunei Darussalam , New Zealand and Vietnam , " the CAAS said . 
" As of 29 October 2020 , 1200 hours , we have approved 1,375 applications from these places , and received 602 visitors . 
None of the visitors tested positive for COVID 19 upon arrival . "
