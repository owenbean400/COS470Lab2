With lockdowns and movement restrictions in place across the world , people are having to find new ways to exercise . 
Viki Bell teaches karate in Melbourne , Australia -- but her dojo is closed because of the country 's social distancing rules . 
Instead she has started teaching classes virtually , with her students practicing the moves in their own homes on the other side of the camera . 
Julia Basa has used the same strategy . 
She teaches Zumba -- a mix of dance , pilates and aerobics -- in Melbourne , but lately has had to hold sessions online from her backyard . 
Other places are getting more creative . 
One neighborhood in the UK town of Frodsham has started doing daily dance and fitness sessions outdoors -- everyone on the road , following a resident instructor , but carefully standing a number of feet apart to adhere to social distancing criteria .
