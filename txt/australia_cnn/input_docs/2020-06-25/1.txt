The Australian state of Victoria has asked for hundreds of troops to be deployed to the area , to assist officials trying to curb a coronavirus spike in the region . 
On Thursday Premier Daniel Andrews indicated that his government would request the presence of 1,000 Defence Force personnel to help enforce quarantine and conduct coronavirus tests . 
But the state now appears to have scaled back that appeal . 
Later on Thursday an Australian federal government source told CNN that the request has been reduced to around 200 troops , who will assist solely in a medical capacity .
