Australia ’s national identity is largely shaped by its geography . 
The land and people are , as the country ’s national anthem states , " girt by sea " -- protected from the trials and tribulations of the outside world by oceans and distance . 
The novel coronavirus pandemic , however , is perhaps the greatest challenge to that theory Australia has faced , unprecedented in the history of the world ’s only continent country . 
By cutting off international flights , Australia has effectively lifted the drawbridge and isolated itself from the rest of the world . 
To date , more than 2,300 people have been infected there , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University . 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison ’s government also established widespread restrictions on social gatherings , shutting bars , gyms and movie theaters and restricting restaurants to delivery or take out .
