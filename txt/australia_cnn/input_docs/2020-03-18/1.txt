Australia â€™s Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a " human biosecurity emergency " today and announced new restrictions to halt the spread of the coronavirus . 
This declaration of a human biosecurity emergency gives the government the power to impose curfews and order people into quarantine if deemed necessary , Morrison said in a televised address . 
The new restrictions include an upgraded travel advice to Level 4 -- meaning " do not travel . " 
It 's the first time the country has imposed a Level 4 warning , Morrison said . 
He added that this travel restriction is because the biggest risk comes from imported cases -- " Australians returning from overseas . " 
The government is also banning all non essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people , effective today . 
Morrison also urged people to stop panic buying . 
The government also unveiled economic aid . 
The government announced a $ 430 million aid package for its airlines . 
This comes as the aviation industry worldwide has suffered from the virus ; 
Norwegian Air had to lay off half of all its staff , and an aviation consultancy warned most airlines in the world could be bankrupt by the end of May without government intervention . 
Australia has reported 454 confirmed cases , of which 43 have recovered and 5 have died .
