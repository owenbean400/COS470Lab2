A Covid 19 cluster in the Australian state of South Australia has grown to 17 cases , all believed to be linked to a leak from the state â€™s hotel quarantine system , according to health authorities . 
This the first local outbreak in South Australia since April , when the state introduced a hard border policy . 
Currently 600 passengers are permitted to arrive on international flights in state capital Adelaide each week , but they must undergo a 14 day quarantine in a designated hotel . 
On Sunday , Chief Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said that the " medi hotel " where one infected person worked is where " we 're considering the source to be . " 
Multiple schools and a fast food restaurant in Adelaide have been closed , and contact tracing is underway . 
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said Monday that South Australia should not reinstate a hard border as a reaction to the outbreak . 
" Having these strong testing , tracing and isolation systems are absolutely critical and South Australia , on all the evidence , does have exactly that , " he said . 
The states of Western Australia , Tasmania and the Northern Territory now require arrivals from South Australia to undergo mandatory 14 day self quarantine .
