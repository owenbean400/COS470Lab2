Here 's what has been happening in Australia : Sydney 's home state shuts non essential services : New South Wales -- the state where Sydney is located -- will close most services and businesses to try to slow the spread of the virus . 
Essential services , such as petrol stations , convenience stores and pharmacies , will stay open . 
New South Wales has 469 confirmed cases , the highest of any Australian state . 
A new economic support package : Australia has announced a second support package , this time worth $ 38 billion , to help households and businesses . 
Another state gets tough : South Australia 's Premier Steven Marshall said Sunday that a spike in confirmed cases from travelers entering the state had " forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia . " 
But while Marshall called it a border closure , in fact the state is still open -- arrivals will just need to self isolate for 14 days . 
The new measures will be " progressively enforced between now and 4pm on Tuesday . " 
Meanwhile , elsewhere : Northern Territory and the island state of Tasmania require all travelers to self isolate for 14 days upon entry .
