Dr . Amesh Adalja , a fellow with the Infectious Diseases Society of America , says preliminary data shows the Covid 19 vaccine will offer protection against new variants of the virus . 
Some background : Scientist say that a new variant of Covid 19 was first detected in the United Kingdom and can likely spread faster than others . 
The variant has also been detected in Denmark , the Netherlands and Australia , according to the World Health Organization . 
In South Africa , a different coronavirus variant has been reported , the WHO 's technical lead for Covid 19 , Maria van Kerkhove , said Monday . 
Adalja said vaccines also stimulate other parts of your immune system that are important to fighting off viruses . 
" I do not think there 's any worry at this point , " he said . 
" Moderna , Pfizer , they 're doing tests to make sure , but everything that we 're seeing so far is really reassuring that these vaccines will be able to take this strain out just like they take out ... the prior , older strains . " 
Adalja added that the concept of virus mutations is not uncommon . 
" Viruses like this , coronaviruses that have RNA genetic material , they mutate a lot , " he said .
