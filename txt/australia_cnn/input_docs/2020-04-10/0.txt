Most years , Easter weekend marks the last big hurrah of beautiful warm weather in Australia . 
But 2020 is not any ordinary year . 
Amid the Covid 19 pandemic , people all over the world are being asked to practice social distancing and stay indoors as much as possible . 
For Aussies who were hoping to spend a holiday weekend at the beach , though , this edict is proving a challenge . 
Arguably the most famous beach in all of Australia , Sydney 's Bondi closed to the public last month when locals had too difficult a time staying away . 
Since then , Bondi 's beachside pavilion has transformed from a place to get snacks and change into swimsuits into a pop up coronavirus testing center . 
The neighborhood had been identified as a hot spot for coronavirus cases , some of which are being linked to the many backpackers who come from around the world to stay in hostels near the water . 
Now , the beaches along the Gold Coast in Queensland are also officially off limits too .
