Residents of the Australian city of Melbourne can travel freely within the state of Victoria after a so called " ring of steel " around the city was removed on Monday . 
The " ring of steel , " as locals called the tough Covid 19 restrictions , consisted of checkpoints manned by police and other officials , and separated Melbourne from the rest of the state throughout the bulk of the city â€™s 112 day lockdown . 
The state government has also dropped a previous restriction preventing Melbourne residents from traveling further than 25 kilometers ( 15.5 miles ) from their homes . 
Movie theaters , galleries , museums and music halls will now be able to open , with 20 people allowed per space . 
What happened this summer : Restrictive measures were put in this summer , when Melbourne and the rest of the state of Victoria were recording hundreds of cases per day -- becoming the epicenter of Australia 's Covid 19 outbreak . 
Though the decision to lock down Victoria was unpopular with some people , by late September , cases had declined to low double digits , allowing the government to begin lifting restrictions . 
Melbourne has not recorded a new Covid 19 case since October 29 , the week its lockdown ended . 
Neighboring New South Wales on Monday also said it had not detected any new cases detected in the previous 24 hours .
