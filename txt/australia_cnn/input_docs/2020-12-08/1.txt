Australia will extend restrictions on overseas travel until March next year due to the Covid 19 pandemic , the country 's Health Minister Greg Hunt said Tuesday . 
The restrictions limit cruise vessels ' movement and outbound international travel . 
Retail stores at international airports in Australia are also subject to restrictions in their operations . 
Hunt said the government has advised extending the restrictions on overseas travel until March 17 , 2021 , because the pandemic has posed " an unacceptable public health risk . " 
Australia 's Governor General David Hurley will consider the proposed extension within this week , Hunt said . 
" The Australian Government is working closely with state and territory agencies and the cruise industry , to develop a framework for the staged resumption of cruise ships in a manner that is proportionate to the public health risk , " he added .
