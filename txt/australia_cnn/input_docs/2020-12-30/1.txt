Australia 's Minister of Immigration , Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has threatened to cancel the visas of any visitors caught breaking rules designed to prevent the spread of Covid 19 in the country , after hundreds of people attended a beach party in Sydney 's Bronte Beach on Christmas Day . 
Only 100 people were allowed to gather at an outdoor event in Greater Sydney on December 25 after a new outbreak of Covid 19 in the city 's Northern Beaches region led to tightened restrictions over the Christmas period . 
But witnesses said the crowd at Bronte Beach on the afternoon of Christmas Day was in its " hundreds , " many of whom were drinking alcohol and not wearing face masks . 
Brad Hazzard , Health Minister for the state of New South Wales ( NSW ) , warned the party could be a " superspreader event . " 
Local journalist Peter Hannam , who walked by the event at 5 p.m . , said a number of people in attendance were talking loudly in British accents . 
It 's not immediately clear how many of the crowd were residents or visitors on temporary visas . 
Australia 's borders have been closed to anyone except citizens and residents since March , but the government announced in April that temporary visa holders -- including backpackers -- could extend their visas . 
But now , Immigration Minister Alex Hawke has warned that any foreign citizens caught breaching public health orders could have their visas reviewed or even canceled .
