Australian authorities are in the process of tracking down 2,647 people who disembarked from a Princess Cruises ship on Thursday after three former passengers and a crew member tested positive for the novel coronavirus . 
The Ruby Princess , which traveled between Sydney and New Zealand , had been considered " low risk " according to Kerry Chant , a health officer for the state of New South Wales . 
NSW Minister of Health Brad Hazzard said all passengers who left the cruise liner were asked to spend 14 days in quarantine at home . 
However , authorities are still concerned " that those people came off the ship with no knowledge of Covid 19 actually being on the ship , " Hazzard said . 
As of Friday afternoon local time , NSW Health officials have emailed and sent text messages to all cruise passengers advising them of the confirmed cases onboard the ship and to " reinforce the importance of self isolation and regular self monitoring of symptoms . " 
A total of 1,050 crew members are onboard the ship , according to NSW Health . 
While the three infected passengers got off the ship , the crew member who contracted the virus is still onboard and in isolation . 
The ship , which is now " somewhere between Sydney and Wollongong , " according to Chant , has doctors and intensive care unit facilities on board . 
The current plan is to use the medical professionals and facilities onboard to treat the crew .
