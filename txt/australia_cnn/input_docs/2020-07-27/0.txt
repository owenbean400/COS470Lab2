Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization 's health emergencies program , said governments that react quickly and are honest about their countries ’ Covid 19 situations should be praised . 
" The real judge and test of a country ’s capacity and resolve is how quickly and how comprehensively does each country respond to those signals that the disease is back , " he said at a press briefing on Monday in Geneva . 
" I think both Australia and Japan deserve a lot of praise for the way in which they ’re trying to contain the disease sub national or at community level , " Ryan added . 
The WHO official said that what countries are really trying to do is " ensure that small numbers of cases and clusters do not reignite sustained and efficient community transmission . " 
Governments should be praised , Ryan said , when they pick up on these clusters of cases and when they react quickly and demonstrate that they ’re taking responsibility and communicating transparently . 
" We should refrain , I would hope , from overly criticizing governments who are actively seeking cases , actively doing surveillance , doing contact tracing , they ’re trying to uncover the problem , " he said . 
" They ’re trying to surface the issues and deal with the issues . " 
Ryan said that situations that should worry people are those where problems are not being surfaced , or are being glossed over , where everything looks good . 
" Because one thing is for sure with Covid , as it is with every infectious disease , " he said . 
" Just looking good does not mean things are good . " 
Ryan said that he would rather being in a situation with a government that is " honest and truthful about the situation on the ground , " that communicates what is happening and demonstrates that it can take action and react quickly .
