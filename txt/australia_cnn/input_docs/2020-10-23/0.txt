Australia 's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has agreed to raise the quota of Australian citizens stranded abroad that can return to the country . 
Australia has some of the strictest border rules in the world . 
Only Australians are allowed into the country -- and there 's a limit on how many are allowed in . 
In July , around 4,000 people each week were allowed to return . 
All Australians must go through a 14 day quarantine in a state facility , and pay 3,000 Australian dollars ( $ 2,100 ) to do so . 
According to Morrison , there are 26,000 Australians stranded overseas who are trying to get back . 
But starting next month , an additional 140 people will be able to return each week to Perth in Western Australia , and another 150 will be able to return each week to Queensland . 
Another 100 arrivals will be allowed each fortnight into Adelaide , in South Australia . 
Reopening target : Morrison said that the government was pushing forward with the " reopening framework for Australia by Christmas " -- likely a reference to having borders between states and territories open again . 
Australia has reported more than 27,000 coronavirus cases and 900 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally .
