Maryland based biotechnology company Novavax announced plans Monday to begin enrolling approximately 130 people with a new experimental vaccine against the novel coronavirus . 
It â€™s the 10th company worldwide to start human trials of potential vaccines against Covid 19 . 
The first volunteer is expected to be vaccinated Monday evening in Australia , where the initial phase of the trial is being conducted at two sites . 
The vaccine , called NVX Co V2373 , produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in pre clinical testing , according to a company statement issued Monday . 
The announcement was made only in the statement , and the data has not been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal . 
The company says it expects to have preliminary safety and effectiveness results in July . 
If the results are promising , the trial will proceed into its second phase , in which a larger group of participants in multiple countries would be tested to evaluate the safety , effectiveness and Covid 19 disease reduction capacity of the vaccine . 
Meanwhile , Novavax plans to produce the vaccine ahead of time , so a supply will be available if it is proven to work . 
The manufacturing is being accelerated with $ 388 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , a global partnership among public , private and philanthropic organizations . 
A company spokesperson tells CNN Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year , and a billion doses in 2021 .
