The Head of the Japan Olympic Committee said postponing this summer ’s Games should be considered , among other options , as the coronavirus pandemic continues . 
Speaking to reporters on Monday , Yasuhiro Yamashita , said : " From the athletes ' point of view of safety and security , we have to come to a stage where we cannot help but consider things including postponement […] I would like to say once again it is not decided that the Olympics is not held in July . " 
The International Olympic Committee announced yesterday that it had given itself a deadline of four weeks to make a decision on the Games . 
Yamashita , though , warned that too long a delay would be a burden to athletes given the possibility of having to qualify again for the Games . 
" I think the postponing period should not be long when we think about the athletes and the Olympic village , " he said . 
His comments come after both Canada and Australia ’s National Olympic Committees said they would not send athletes to Tokyo this year because of the risks associated with the virus . 
The Japan Olympic Committee is scheduled to hold a board meeting in Tokyo on Friday to discuss the status of this summer ’s Games .
