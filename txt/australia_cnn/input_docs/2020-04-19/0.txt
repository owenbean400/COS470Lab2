Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has called for an " independent review " of the circumstances that led to the start of the coronavirus pandemic , adding to growing pressure on China over its handling of the virus . 
" We need to know the sorts of details that an independent review would identify for us about the genesis of the virus , about the approaches to dealing with it , and addressing it , about the openness with which information was shared , about interaction with the World Health Organization , interaction with other international leaders , " she said in an interview with Australia 's ABC television on Sunday . 
" All of those sorts of things will need to be on the table . " 
Paine said that when it comes to Australia 's relationship with China , " transparency is essential . " 
Asked whether she believes the World Health Organization is too " beholden " of China , she said Australia shares the concerns that the US has expressed . 
" I think it is about an independent mechanism , and I â€™m not sure that you can have the health organization , which has been responsible for disseminating much of the international communications material , and doing much of the early engagement and investigative work , also as the review mechanism , " Payne said . 
" That strikes me as somewhat poacher and gamekeeper . "
