A small but growing coronavirus cluster linked to a youth detention center in Brisbane , Australia has led to the reimposition of stricter measures on gatherings in southeast Queensland . 
The Queensland government on Saturday linked six new cases to the Brisbane youth detention center , where a 77 year old supervisor tested positive for the virus earlier this week . 
The facility now has seven confirmed cases -- all adult workers or their close relatives . 
As a result of the cluster , gatherings in homes and outdoors are restricted to 10 people in areas of southeast Queensland . 
Queensland has reported a total of 1,103 cases , including six deaths . 
The state has shut its border with New South Wales in an effort to curb the spread of the virus . 
The state is also closed to travelers from Victoria , which has been battling a surge in infections since late June . 
However , the number of new daily cases in Victoria has been falling over the past week . 
On Friday , it recorded 182 fresh infections and 13 deaths -- the second consecutive day with less than 200 new cases . 
On Friday , the Victorian government said it would consider relaxing restrictions should daily cases drop to 50 or below .
