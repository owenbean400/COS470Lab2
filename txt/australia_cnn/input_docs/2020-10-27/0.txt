Australia 's Victoria state reported no new Covid 19 infections in the past 24 hours for the second consecutive day , the Department of Health and Human Services said in a tweet Tuesday . 
Monday was the first time since June 8 that Victoria has reported no new cases , statistics from the DHHS have shown . 
The total number of Covid 19 cases in Victoria remains at 20,343 , and the total death toll at 817 . 
The remarkable milestone of no new cases comes just months after Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews declared a " state of disaster " to stem an outbreak that saw as many as 725 people in the state test positive for the virus in a single day . 
The steep decline in cases has allowed the government to lift major social distancing measures that have been in place for weeks , including moving the state capital , Melbourne , out of lockdown beginning Wednesday .
