The Sydney district of Waverley Council has reported more coronavirus cases than any district in Australia , Mayor Paula Masselos said in a statement today . 
Waverley includes some of Sydney 's famous beaches , including Bondi , Tamarama and Bronte . 
" This is a message I did not want to have to share , but we now know Waverley Council currently has the highest number of Covid 19 cases in Australia , with 105 being recorded as at 8 p.m . on 25 March , " Masselos said . 
Bondi Beach closed last weekend after thousands of people were seen at one of the city â€™s most famous landmarks despite public health warnings to stay home and away from crowded areas .
