The Australian Defense Force will help enforce a mandatory two week quarantine for all arrivals at airports nationwide starting Sunday , said Prime Minister Scott Morrison today . 
Passengers arriving in all Australian states and territories will have to quarantine in hotels or other accommodations before being able to return homes . 
The additional measures are to prevent a rise in imported cases ; two thirds of cases in Australia are from citizens returning home from abroad , said Morrison . 
According to Morrison , 7,120 Australians returned to the country on Thursday . 
He also said authorities will be taking greater steps to enforce isolation of those who have already arrived and are in in quarantine , but did not elaborate further on those steps .
