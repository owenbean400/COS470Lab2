Australian airline Qantas is offering a seven hour " scenic joy flight " around Australia for people who miss flying . 
" Qantas will operate a special scenic joy flight above the Northern Territory , Queensland and New South Wales in response to strong demand from frequent flyers who miss the experience of flying and just want to take to the skies , " a news release from Qantas said Thursday . 
Tickets went on sale Thursday and sold out within 10 minutes , a Qantas spokesperson told CNN . 
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane will fly low level to popular Australian sites like Uluru , the Great Barrier Reef and Sydney Harbor . 
" No passport or quarantine required , " the news release said . 
The flight will take off October 10 from Sydney and make its way up the New South Wales coast , cross the Queensland border to fly over the Gold Coast , Brisbane and Sunshine Coast before continuing north to fly over the Whitsundays and Great Barrier Reef . 
It will then track across the country to Uluru and Kata Tjuta to showcase the iconic red center before returning to Sydney . 
" The special scenic flight is designed to fulfil the travel experience that many Australians have been missing throughout the COVID pandemic . 
Frequent flyers have said they just want to get on a Qantas aircraft and experience the joy of flying again without having to navigate border restrictions or quarantines , " the news release said . 
For months , Australia has closed borders to almost all foreigners , and any Australian citizens wanting to go overseas need an exit visa to leave the country .
