Australia is entering its first recession in nearly three decades , largely due to the economic impact of the Covid 19 pandemic , Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Wednesday . 
The nation 's economy contracted 0.3 % in the first three months of this year , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics . 
Frydenberg said he expected figures for the second quarter of 2020 to be worse . 
Experts say Australia was able to weather other serious global financial crises thanks to a combination of steady population growth , a rise in exports and the increasing importance of its service economy . 
Frydenberg acknowledged the Covid 19 shutdown as the end of a 29 year run of economic growth in Australia , but praised his government 's economic stimulus measures . 
" We have avoided the economic fate , and the health fate , of other nations because of the measures , " he said .
