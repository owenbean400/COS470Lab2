It 's just past midnight in Melbourne , which means the Australian city has gone into a six week lockdown following a rise in coronavirus cases . 
Melbourne has a population of almost five million people who will be affected by the measure . 
Under the new " Stay at Home " stage three lockdown , the only reasons residents will be able to leave home is for grocery shopping , caregiving , exercise or work . 
Police and the army will monitor roadblocks to clamp down on people who do not need to be outside . 
Before today , 31 local government areas of Metropolitan Melbourne were already at stage 3 , and a residential block housing around three thousand residents were in hard lockdown . 
Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews posted on his verified Facebook page that " I know people will be feeling a lot of different emotions tonight . 
No one wants to be in this situation . 
But in the absence of a vaccine , the only way to defeat this virus is to deprive it of what it needs to spread . " 
Andrews warned in a post that " for every restriction that you break and all the health advice that you ignore – the consequence maybe someone ’s life . 
Now more than ever , we need Victorians to play their part . 
Lives are counting on it . "
