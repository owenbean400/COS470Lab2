Failed quarantine measures in two hotels in the Australian state of Victoria lead to the deaths of 768 people and the infection of 18,418 , according to closing submissions at the Covid 19 Hotel Quarantine Inquiry . 
Ben Ihle , counsel , assisting at the Victorian inquiry , said that the hotel quarantine became a " seeding ground " for the virus , as authorities linked the massive Covid 19 outbreak in Victoria to the hotel cluster using genomic sequencing . 
" On the 23rd May , Victoria 's Covid 19 death toll was 19 . 
As of today , the total number of Covid related deaths in Victoria is 787 , " Ilhe added . 
The number of cases in the state has risen exponentially from June to the present day . 
" As of 15th June , Victoria had record 1,732 confirmed cases of Covid 19 . 
As of today , that number 20,150 , " Ilhe said . 
The movement of the virus from the hotel cluster to the rest of the state was responsible for 99 % of infections in the state , added Ilhe .
