The coronavirus pandemic will cause Australia ’s GDP to fall by 4.75 % in the fiscal year 2020-1 , Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said today . 
Inflated welfare programs and plummeting tax receipts are the cause of the dip in the country ’s GDP , according to Treasury , with the country ’s official unemployment rate forecast to rise to 9.25 % , Frydenberg said . 
The Australian government says it has spent $ 117 billion ( AUD $ 164 billion ) on welfare , wage support , and economic stimulus measures since the pandemic began . 
Frydenberg on Thursday said that spending has prevented the loss of around 700,000 jobs . 
Australia ’s gross debt will rise to $ 608 billion ( AUD $ 851.9 billion ) , over a third of the country 's GDP , according to Treasury . 
The 2020-1 budget will fall $ 131 billion ( AUD$184.5 billion ) into deficit , despite a pre Covid projection of a AUD $ 5 billion budget surplus for the fiscal year . 
" These are harsh numbers , " Frydenberg said on Thursday . 
This year ’s budget deficit as a portion of GDP is the highest since World War II .
