Cloth face coverings should have at least two layers to be most effective , and preferably three , according to new research published Thursday . 
And a set of videos brings the evidence to life . 
A team in Australia used tailored LED lighting and a high speed camera to capture the dispersal of airborne droplets from someone talking , sneezing and coughing while wearing different types of face coverings – bare faced , with a single layer of cloth , a double layer and a medical grade surgical mask . 
The results were clear , the team at the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of New South Wales reported in the British Medical Journal ’s Thorax . 
While they said a single layer face covering is better than nothing " a double layer cloth face covering was significantly better at reducing the droplet spread caused by coughing and sneezing , " they added . 
The single layer mask was made from a t shirt , using a no sew method . 
The two layer mask was made using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s method that uses two rectangles of cotton layered over one another . 
While the surgical mask was the most effective at preventing transmission of droplets , cloth face coverings did reduce the spread of droplets . 
" Guidelines on home made cloth masks should stipulate multiple layers ( at least 3 ) , " they added . 
" Several other factors determine the efficacy of cloth masks such as type of material , the number of layers , the arrangement of different layers and frequency of washing . "
