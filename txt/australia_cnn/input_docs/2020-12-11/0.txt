An Australian produced coronavirus vaccine candidate has been scrapped after trial participants returned false positive test results for HIV , developers announced Friday . 
The inoculation , which had yet to progress beyond Phase 1 trials , was being jointly developed by the University of Queensland and Australian biotech company CSL . 
Australia had hoped the vaccine would be available by mid 2021 . 
In a statement , CSL said no serious adverse effects had been reported in the 216 trial participants , and the vaccine was shown to have a " strong safety profile . " 
However trial data revealed that antibodies generated by the vaccine interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests , CSL said . 
If the vaccine was rolled out nationally , CSL said it could undermine public health in Australia by causing a wave of false positive HIV tests in the community . 
" Follow up tests confirmed that there is no HIV virus present , just a false positive on certain HIV tests . 
There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection , " the statement added . 
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Friday that the vaccine " will no longer feature as part of the country 's vaccine plan . " 
Australia had pre emptively ordered 51 million doses of the CSL vaccine in October . 
Morrison said Australia had backed four vaccines that showed promise but " at no stage ... believed that all four of those vaccines would likely get through that process . "
