Calls to postpone the Summer Olympics are growing as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates around the world . 
The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee ( USOPC ) said that the organization has heard the concerns from Team USA athletes regarding the upcoming 2020 Games , and that the " path toward postponement is the most promising , " in a statement released Monday . 
But countries are taking a stand . 
In recent days , a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the games to be postponed . 
Canada and Australia said they would not send any teams on Monday . 
Speaking to lawmakers on the same day , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the Games is a possibility . 
This was the first time Abe has wavered from his staunch public position that the Olympics will start July 24 as scheduled . 
Abe is scheduled to speak with IOC chief Thomas Bach over the telephone later Tuesday .
