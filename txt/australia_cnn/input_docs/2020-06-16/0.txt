The women were allowed on compassionate grounds to leave their isolation at a hotel in Auckland and travel to Wellington via private vehicle to visit a relative who has since died , Director General of Health Dr . Ashley Bloomfield said in a news briefing today . 
He added that one of the women experienced " mild symptoms , " but put them down to a pre existing condition .
