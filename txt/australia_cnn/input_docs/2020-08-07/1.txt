Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a Friday news conference he believes any country that eventually produces a viable Covid 19 vaccine needs to share it with the world . 
Morrison also pledged that if Australia finds the vaccine , " we will share it . " 
He also said that Australia is well positioned to take advantage and be " in a position to be able to manufacture and supply vaccines should they be developed . " 
Where Australia 's vaccine efforts stand : Australia 's research and development for a coronavirus vaccine around the world are happening at " warp speed , " said Paul Kelly , the country 's acting chief medical officer . 
Kelly also said the Australian government is looking " very clearly and carefully " into advance purchasing options , as well as local manufacturing options for potential vaccines .
