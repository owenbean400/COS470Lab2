Starting tonight , New Zealand will ban any foreign citizens from entering the country , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced in a news conference today . 
The travel ban will now apply to those coming from the Pacific Islands , who had previously been exempt from restrictions . 
It will also close off travel between New Zealand and Australia for the majority of citizens in the two countries , who are typically able to travel back and forth without a visa . 
" A small number of exemptions to the new measures can be sought for humanitarian reasons , essential health workers and citizens of Samoa and Tonga who need to travel to New Zealand for essential reasons , " Ardern said . 
New Zealanders ’ partners , legal guardians or any dependent children traveling with them may also return . 
The threat of imported cases : The new measures come after the country reported eight new cases today , bringing the national total to 28 . 
All the new infections are " related to overseas travel , " not locally transmitted , said the ministry . 
There is not yet any evidence of community transmission in the country . 
" All of the cases of Covid 19 identified in New Zealand relate to people travelling to New Zealand and bringing the virus with them – therefore we need to further restrict the risk of people bringing the virus into New Zealand , " Ardern said in the release . 
UPDATE : This post was updated to accurately reflect the restrictions .
