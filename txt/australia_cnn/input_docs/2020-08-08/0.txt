The number of new Covid 19 patients identified each day in the Australian state of Victoria has begun to stabilize thanks to strict lockdown measures , the government said Saturday . 
A total of 446 new cases and 12 deaths were recorded Friday , according to Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews . 
Sutton said that the government 's models showed the lockdown measures prevented about 20,000 cases . 
In May , Australia was held up as a global model for its handling of the outbreak , which started with early measures to bar entry from high risk countries . 
Stricter curbs on social gatherings , expanded testing , restaurant and bar closures followed as cases rose , with some states sealing their borders . 
But Covid 19 cases in Victoria rose suddenly in recent weeks , with many new infections in aged care homes and among healthcare workers . 
Authorities responded by instituting some of the most stringent movement restrictions in Australia 's history . 
Sutton said the government will not see the results of an even stricter lockdown for another week .
