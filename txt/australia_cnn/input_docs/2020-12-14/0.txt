New Zealand has agreed in principle to establish a much anticipated travel bubble with neighboring Australia -- although there 's still no firm date on when the corridor would start . 
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on December 14 that a travel bubble can be expected in the first quarter of next year , meaning that people can travel between the two countries without having to complete a 14 day mandatory quarantine at either end . 
Since October , travelers from New Zealand have been allowed quarantine free travel to certain Australian destinations , but they still have to quarantine when they return home . 
Ardern 's announcement means that the bubble -- which has been discussed for months and has been widely anticipated by people in both countries -- will finally allow for quarantine free travel both ways . 
It comes two days after New Zealand announced plans to roll out quarantine free travel with the Cook Islands in the first quarter of next year .
