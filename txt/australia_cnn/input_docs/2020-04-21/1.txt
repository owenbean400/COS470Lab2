An estimated 780,000 jobs were cut in Australia after the country announced business closures and shutdown measures , according to new government data . 
The data , collected and released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) and the Australian Taxation Office , showed that jobs nationwide decreased by 6 % between March 14 and April 4 . 
On February 20 , the country had just over 13 million employed people in its labor force , according to the ABS . 
Assuming that number held steady over the next few weeks , that would mean about 780,000 jobs were lost . 
People aged under 20 were worst hit ; jobs in this demographic fell by 9.9 % . 
Geographically , the states of Victoria and Tasmania had the biggest decreases in jobs . 
In terms of sector , the accommodation and food services industries were predictably the hardest hit -- more than a quarter of all jobs in these sectors were cut . 
The next highest cuts came in the arts and recreation services industries .
