Virgin Australia has collapsed into administration , one day after billionaire founder Richard Branson made a last ditch appeal for government support for the country 's second biggest airline .

The company said today that it had entered voluntary administration as it looked for money to revive its business , and that it eventually hoped to " emerge stronger on the other side of this crisis . "
