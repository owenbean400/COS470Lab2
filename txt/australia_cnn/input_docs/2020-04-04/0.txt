Australia is threatening to kick out visitors who do not comply with the country 's social distancing rules . 
At a news conference today , acting immigration minister Alan Tudge had a blunt message for non compliant travelers : He also urged international tourists to leave the country . 
" For international tourists , take the next flight home , particularly if you do not have any family support , " he said . 
" The largest source of tourists in the country at the moment are from the United Kingdom . 
Next week alone there are 150 flights to London -- so there are those options for people to get home . 
And we ask them to exercise those options . " 
Skilled visa holders : Australia has about 139,000 temporary skilled visa holders , who are often invited to fill skills shortages , typically on two year or four year visas . 
If these visa holders lose their job , they have 60 days to find a new one or leave . 
For those who have been stood down or had their hours reduced by the coronavirus measures , their visa will remain valid , Tudge said . 
Backpacker visas : There are about 118,000 people on " backpacker " visas who can work for six months for a single employer . 
If they work in critical industries , they can work longer than six months , Tudge said , and their visa will be extended for another year . 
New Zealanders : About half of the 600,000 New Zealanders in Australia wo not have access to job seeker payments , but will have access to job keeper payments , Tudge added .
