A kangaroo was spotted bouncing through an almost deserted South Australian city on Sunday amid the coronavirus lockdown , according to police . 
With much of the country being told to stay at home , Adelaide -- a coastal city of more than 1.2 million people -- has become a much more attractive place for the country 's iconic animal to hang out . 
The kangaroo was caught on CCTV camera on Sunday morning . 
Officers watching the footage just happened to see the marsupial bouncing down the nearly empty streets , a South Australian police spokesperson told CNN . 
The kangaroo narrowly escaped a road accident , before heading to Adelaide 's West Parklands nature reserve , the spokesperson said . 
Every now and then , kangaroos are spotted in Adelaide 's suburbs , but it 's not usual to see them bouncing down the central city streets , the spokesperson said . 
" It was quite unique , " the spokesperson said , adding that it was likely the quiet of the coronavirus lockdown that had drawn the kangaroo to the city .
