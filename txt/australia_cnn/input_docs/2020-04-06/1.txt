Australia 's New South Wales police have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the docking and disembarking of the Ruby Princess cruise ship , which created a major cluster of coronavirus cases , police said in a statement Sunday . 
The investigation will " fully examine " the communications and actions that allowed passengers to disembark from the cruise ship in Sydney on March 19 , NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said in a statement . 
It is expected that the investigation will involve interviewing thousands of witnesses , including the ship 's captain , doctors , crew members , and passengers , and officials from the federal and state government . 
Here 's what the NSW Department of Health said last Friday : " No cases of Covid 19 were identified " at the time when the ship docked . 
The vast majority of passengers did not report symptoms until after leaving the ship . 
As of last Friday , at least 342 people are confirmed to have contracted Covid 19 from the ship , it added . 
Up to 200 of the 1,040 crew members onboard the ship have displayed coronavirus like symptoms , while 16 have returned positive results for Covid 19 , NSW Police said . 
Meanwhile , the Ruby Princess will continue to berth at Port Kembla for up to 10 days to allow for safer access for medical assessments , NSW police said Monday . 
Health authorities will carry out " medical assessments , treatment , or emergency extractions of her crew , " according to a police statement . 
Crew members will not be allowed to disembark unless in an emergency and approved by the police commissioner .
