Two cases of the new Covid 19 variation detected in the United Kingdom have been found in managed quarantine facilities in Sydney , Australia , according to health authorities . 
New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said Monday that the cases had been identified in returning travelers from the UK while they were in state imposed quarantine . 
Australia requires all international arrivals -- with a few exceptions -- to undergo 14 days of state run hotel quarantine . 
Dr Chant said that the new UK strain is not responsible for an emerging cluster of Covid 19 in Sydney â€™s north . 
That cluster is now up to 83 cases , rising by 15 new cases detected Sunday . 
Australia has reported more than 28,000 coronavirus cases and 908 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally .
