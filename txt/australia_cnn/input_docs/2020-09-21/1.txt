Bill Gates , founder of Microsoft and co chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , said that even though he expects vaccine approvals to come by early next year , and see the US begin to return to normal by summer 2021 , he believes we will not see the end of the pandemic until 2022 . 
Gates also expressed his frustration with how the US has handled its approach to the pandemic . 
" Unfortunately , we did a very poor job , and you could of see that in the numbers if you compare the Asian countries like South Korea and Australia , " Gates said . 
Additionally , Gates noted the way testing was handled at the beginning of the pandemic , and the way is still being handled today , played a big role in the spread of the virus in the US . 
" You know what happened was that 40,000 people came out of China , because we did not ban the residents and citizens from coming in . 
We created this rush . 
And we did not have the ability to test or quarantine those people , so that seeded the disease here , " Gates said . 
" Even today , people do not get their results in 24 hours , which is outrageous that we still have that . "
