Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement in Sydney , Australia , plan to go ahead with a rally set for Saturday despite a Supreme Court injunction ruling that it is illegal . 
Police in the state of New South Wales ( NSW ) took the matter to the New South Wales Supreme Court in Sydney on Friday night in a last ditch attempt to have the protest banned due to coronavirus safety concerns . 
Supreme Court Justice Desmond Fagan ruled that an NSW Public Health Order banning large gatherings " applies to everyone " and that in this case the right to protest is being " deferred . " 
Fagan added that social distancing has been crucial to Australia ’s suppression of the disease . 
As of Friday , NSW had not had a local contraction of coronavirus for nine days . 
Four new positive cases announced on Friday involved people returning from overseas . 
Earlier on Friday , NSW Police Commissioner David Elliot referred to anyone who planned to protest on Friday as " nuts . " 
Protest organizers , however , said they would continue with the march . 
" We are not going to stop . 
We are going to march . 
We do not care what any acts of law tells us what to do because those acts and laws are killing us , " said Letona Dungay , the mother of David Dungay , an Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 . 
In a statement on Friday night , NSW Green Party MP David Shoebridge wrote : " First Nations people are organizing this protest and asking for solidarity . 
Let ’s be clear with this late decision people will still attend . 
We will now work to make any gathering as safe as possible . "
