Australia ’s Defense Department will deploy 500 more troops to enforce stay at home orders in the state of Victoria , according to State Premier Daniel Andrews . 
Andrews also announced new penalties for people found to be in breach of directions from the chief health officer , including a newly increased $ 3,540 on the spot fine for people who breach isolation orders , the largest instant penalty in Victoria . 
Andrews added that people who conduct in " particularly selfish behavior " may also be taken to court , where they can be fined up to $ 14,290 . 
Andrews said the new fines were being imposed because of the 3,000 door knocks on infected people -- who are meant to be self isolating -- 800 patients were not home . 
Victoria ’s Minister for Police Lisa Neville also warned that Victorian Police will be out in force to find people who are in breach of coronavirus restrictions , saying officers " will not hesitate " to fine people or even detain them in certain cases . 
Victoria recorded 439 new Covid 19 cases and 11 fatalities in the past 24 hours , Andrews said . 
That brings the total number of cases reported in the state to 12,335 and the total death toll to 147 .
