A total of 300 new novel coronavirus cases have been detected in the southeastern Australian state of Victoria , the state 's premier announced Friday . 
Of the 300 cases , only 51 are from a known source with connections to previous cases . 
Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters that health authorities had struggled to conduct contact tracing interviews with around 25 % of people who had tested positive , as they were unable to contact them . 
To ensure that contact tracing interviews are conducted on the same day , twenty eight teams from the Australian Defense Force will be dispatched to go from door to door with health officials , Andrews said . 
Before the military support teams are sent to individual homes , Andrews said that authorities would attempt to telephone first . 
If the call goes unanswered then they will visit the home . 
Andrews warned that if the person was not at home when teams arrived , they could be subject to fines for breaching lockdown orders . 
The military personnel who have been sent to Victoria State has been bolstered to 1400 .
