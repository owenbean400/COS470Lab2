Rory Mc Ilroy has suggested that he may not return to Europe to compete in golf tournaments this year due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The Northern Irishman is competing in the WGC Fed Ex St . Jude Invitational in Tennessee this week and will play in the US PGA Championship next week and the US Open in September . 
But when asked about the possibility of returning for the European Tour , Mc Ilroy cast doubt , saying he might avoid traveling to reduce being exposed . 
" I do not know if I want to travel , I do not know if I want to be exposed to more things and more people . 
So I do not know , I have no idea and I 'm sort of taking it week by week . " 
Fellow players Lee Westwood and Eddie Pepperell decided not to travel to San Francisco for the PGA Championship next week , with Westwood saying he does not " feel comfortable . " 
Tennis : Australia 's Ashleigh Barty , the top ranked singles player in women 's tennis , has announced she will not play in either the Western & Southern Open or the US Open , citing Covid 19 concerns . 
" I love both events so it was a difficult decision but there are still significant risks involved due to Covid 19 and I do not feel comfortable putting my team and I in that position . " 
" I will make my decision on the French Open and the surrounding WTA European tournaments in the coming weeks , " she added .
