More than 300 hospital workers have become infected with Covid 19 in the Australian state of Victoria , Premier Daniel Andrews said Saturday , as another 357 new cases of the virus were detected . 
Five Victorians died as a result of the coronavirus Friday , the youngest in her 60s , Andrews said . 
Of the state 's almost 4,000 active cases , 313 are health workers , and 536 are people in aged care settings , both staff and residents . 
Andrews said the state faces significant challenges in keeping hospitals staffed and maintaining the safety of aged care residents . 
The city of Melbourne and neighboring Mitchell Shire are under " Stage 3 " restrictions , meaning residents can only leave their homes to buy food , go to work , exercise , or give and receive care . 
Andrews said Saturday that a decision to mandate masks in public places is " essentially stage four " of the restrictions , adding " if they are worn by everybody then we may not need to go further . " 
Since the pandemic began , 7,744 cases of the coronavirus have been detected in Victoria , some 3,000 of which have since recovered . 
Neighboring New South Wales , previously Australia â€™s worst hit state , recorded 15 new cases on Friday .
