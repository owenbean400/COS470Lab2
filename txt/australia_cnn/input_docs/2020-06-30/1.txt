The Australian state of Victoria announced a partial lockdown after seeing a double digit rise in the newly confirmed cases for over two weeks . 
On Wednesday 11:50 pm local time , 10 postcode areas in Victoria will return to stage 3 " Stay at Home " until July 29 , Premier Daniel Andrews announced in a daily press briefing on Tuesday . 
What does this mean ? 
People who live in one of the so called " hot zones " can only go out for food and supplies , care and caregiving , exercise , and study or work -- if they ca not do it from home , and the Victorian police will be " actively enforcing these suburban lockdowns . " 
Andrews was told in a briefing that " at least a significant number and potentially more " of the outbreaks in the north of the city are attributable to " staff members in hotel quarantine breaching well known , well understood infection control protocol , " he said . 
He would not elaborate further on the details of those breaches , but said he will have a former judge conduct an inquiry into those infection control protocol breaches . 
Andrews said when there â€™s a spike in cases , they " literally leave no stone unturned to try and answer the riddle , " using genomic sequencing as an important tool to provide answers on the linkages between cases that are not always apparent through contact tracing . 
Last Friday , Victoria announced that it would launch a targeted blitz for testing , allowing residents in 10 suburbs to receive free testing for the next 10 days . 
So far 93,000 tests have been conducted in total , the biggest testing effort in Australia .
