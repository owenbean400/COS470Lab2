The Australian city of Melbourne will remain on a strict " Stage 4 " lockdown until at least September 28 , despite the daily average number of new Covid 19 cases dropping into double digits . 
Stage 4 restrictions were due to expire on September 14 , however the government of Premier Daniel Andrews said today that the city would not be in a safe enough position to do so . 
Melbourne has suffered through the toughest restrictions felt by Australians through the Covid 19 pandemic , as the city has felt the brunt of a brutal second wave of coronavirus . 
The cases : At least 19,542 cases and 666 deaths have been recorded in the state of Victoria , the vast majority coming from the capital Melbourne in July and August . 
New South Wales , the next worst hit Australian state , has recorded 4,114 cases and 52 deaths , mostly in April . 
What the Stage 4 restrictions mean : They include the closure of all non essential businesses , a curfew from 8 p.m . to 5 a.m . local time each day and restrictions on who may go outside and for how long . 
Some minor changes will come into effect as of Sunday , September 13 : The curfew will be pushed back to 9 p.m . and outdoor socializing with one other person will be allowed , Andrews said . 
What to watch for : Further restrictions will be removed gradually from September 28 should the 14 day average for new cases per day be between 30 and 50 . 
That includes public gatherings increased to a maximum of five people , some businesses reopened and some students allowed back to class . 
If the 14 day average in new daily cases is below five as of October 26 , the curfew will be lifted and residents will not need a valid reason to leave their home . 
Saturday saw 63 new cases of Covid 19 in Victoria and five deaths added to the total .
