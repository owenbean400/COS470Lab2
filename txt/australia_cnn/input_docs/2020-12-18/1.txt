Nearly two dozen beaches in Australia 's New South Wales are closing after a mystery Covid 19 cluster linked to the area emerged on Wednesday . 
Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce said they were backing the government â€™s call for residents of the Northern Beaches to stay at home for the next few days . 
" Please do not go to the beach , both to limit the risk of spreading the virus , along with staying safe because beaches will not be patrolled , however , lifeguards are maintaining surveillance capability , " he said . 
The cluster , with 28 confirmed Covid 19 cases as of Friday , marked the first locally transmitted cases in New South Wales since December 3 . 
NSW also " urgently " called on all residents , not just beach residents , to test for Covid 19 on Friday .
