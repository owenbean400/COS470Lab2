The Australian state of Queensland says it will close its borders to any travelers who have been to " Covid 19 hotspots " in the past 14 days , according to a notice posted on the Queensland Government website Friday . 
The hotspots designation includes the Northern Beaches area of Sydney , where a cluster of cases has been identified . 
Those who have been to hotspots will " generally have to quarantine for 14 days at government arranged accommodation " at their own expense , according to the notice . 
Some exceptions will be made for a " limited range of people who can enter for essential purposes . " 
Queensland becomes the second state after Victoria to ban visitors from parts of Sydney ahead of the holidays . 
Victoria has also instituted travel permits for anyone coming from the state of New South Wales , and police are expected to start patrolling land borders .
