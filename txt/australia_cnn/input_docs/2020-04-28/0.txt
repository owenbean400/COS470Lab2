Australia 's iconic Bondi Beach reopened for surfers and swimmers today but the beach remains off limits to everyone else . 
Waverly Council , home to Bondi Beach , said in a statement that the water can be accessed for " the sole purpose of exercising for surfers and swimmers between the hours of 7 a.m . and 5 p.m . on weekdays commencing Tuesday 28 April . " 
" The Council will review these measures on an ongoing basis , including whether to provide access on weekends , " it added . 
But all land based activities on the beach , such as jogging , sunbathing , and social gatherings , will continue to be suspended . 
In March , Bondi beach closed down after thousands of beachgoers ignored the advice from officials to avoid large gatherings and practice social distancing . 
People can also swim and surf at nearby Bronte beach and surf only at Tamarama and Mackenzies Bay .
