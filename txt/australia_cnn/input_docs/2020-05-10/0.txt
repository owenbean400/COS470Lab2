Restaurants and cafes will be allowed to open for up to 10 patrons at a time . 
Outdoor gatherings , weddings , and religious services will be limited to 10 people , while outdoor funerals will be permitted with up to 30 mourners . 
In a statement released Sunday by the NSW Government , Health Minister Brad Hazzard reminded citizens to remain aware of the continuing coronavirus pandemic , adding that " without a vaccine we need to be vigilant , especially when restrictions lift . " 
Australia â€™s Prime Minister outlined on Friday a three step plan to reopen the economy and society , but said it would be up to individual states when they put it in place .
