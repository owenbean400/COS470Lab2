The border between the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales will reopen later this month , according to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian . 
The border between the two states has been closed since July , when a second wave of coronavirus hit Victoria , resulting in more than 20,000 cases . 
Melbourne -- the biggest city in Victoria -- was under lockdown for months . 
On Wednesday , Victoria announced zero new community transmission cases for the fifth day in a row , while New South Wales reported three new local cases Wednesday and six cases from overseas travelers . 
Other domestic border restrictions remain in place .
