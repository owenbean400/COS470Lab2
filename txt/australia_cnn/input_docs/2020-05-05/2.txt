New Zealand 's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joined Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for Australia 's national Cabinet meeting on Tuesday . 
It 's the first time since World War II that a New Zealand leader has attended Australia 's national Cabinet meeting , according to Ardern . 
According to Morrison , Ardern was invited to join the meeting to share New Zealand 's experience with fighting the coronavirus . 
For several weeks , the leaders have been discussing the possibility of a " travel bubble , " which would allow people to travel between the two countries without quarantine restrictions . 
Morrison also said the bubble was " some time away . " 
What 's the benefit of a " travel bubble " ? 
Both countries almost completely shut their borders to foreigners in March , a huge blow to their respective tourism industries . 
But with both appearing to have successfully brought their coronavirus outbreaks under control , politicians are now talking about when borders could be opened to each other . 
Australians make up almost 40 % of international arrivals to New Zealand , and around 24 % of New Zealand 's international visitor spend . 
That 's especially significant in New Zealand , where tourism is the country 's biggest export industry . 
( Tourism is considered an export industry because it involves foreign cash being used to buy New Zealand 's goods and services . ) 
Over in Australia , New Zealanders make up around 15 % of the country 's international visitors , and about 6 % of the international visitor spend . 
Tourism is worth billions to Australia , although it is only the country 's fourth biggest export industry .
