One of the biggest tournaments in the tennis calendar -- the Australian Open -- will begin on February 8 , three weeks later than planned , the Association of Tennis Professionals ( ATP ) confirmed today . 
The delay of the grand slam comes after weeks of intense negotiations between the state government of Victoria and tournament organizers , Tennis Australia , over Covid 19 safety and quarantine requirements . 
On Thursday , the ATP announced that players would have to quarantine for 14 days on arrival in Melbourne , in compliance with Australian travel rules . 
However a " controlled environment " will allow players to prepare for their matches while quarantining , the ATP said . 
Players will travel to Melbourne between January 15 and 31 after the Australian Open qualifying rounds are played in Doha , Qatar . 
The Australian Open was originally scheduled to start on January 18 .
