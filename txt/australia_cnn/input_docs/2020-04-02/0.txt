The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks , hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines , officials said . 
Home Minister Peter Dutton 's office said in a statement yesterday that the fines were one of several new measures being adopted by the government to keep dwindling medical supplies inside the country . 
More than 5,000 people in Australia , including Dutton himself , have contracted the virus . 
Authorities have amended customs regulations to " stop exploitative exports of essential goods , " and the country 's Biosecurity Act to require the Australian Border Force to surrender medical supplies in their custody to the national stockpile . 
Violating the customs law is punishable by a fine of up to 210,000 Australian dollars ( $ 128,275 ) , while those found guilty of violating the Biosecurity Act could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 63,000 Australian dollars , Dutton 's office said ( $ 38,480 ) . 
Like many countries around the world , Australia is currently dealing with a shortage of equipment needed to protect medical workers treating patients who have contracted the novel coronavirus . 
Other countries like the United States and South Korea have enacted similar measures or are considering them .
