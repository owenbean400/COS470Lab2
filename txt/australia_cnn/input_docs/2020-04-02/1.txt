Conditional approval has been reached to allow the Zaandam and Rotterdam ships to dock in Port Everglades in Florida . 
The agreement includes a plan for passengers to go home . 
Final approval of the plan is expected to happen this morning , according to Broward County Commissioner Dr . Barbara Sharief . 
The ships are in sight of Port Everglades and the passengers are due to disembark at 1 p.m . ET , per Sharief . 
According to the five page conditional agreement , passengers who are healthy will be allowed to go home and passengers who are sick will remain on the ship to continue treatment . 
At this time , no one on board is in need of a hospital bed , Sharief said — but if a passenger needs a hospital bed , Broward Health has indicated capacity will not be an issue . 
The healthy people will be transported by a private bus from Port Everglades to airports , which could include the Fort Lauderdale and Miami airports . 
They will go directly to their chartered flights , and they will not linger at the airport to avoid possible community spread . 
Sharief says that after passengers began exhibiting flu like symptoms , the ship received 200 rapid blood test kits to test for Covid 19 . 
Eleven guests were tested and nine people tested positive for the coronavirus . 
Four men over the age of 70 — two of whom who had been diagnosed with coronavirus — died . 
One had a heart attack and the other had a pre existing illness . 
About the passengers : There are 311 US citizen passengers on board , representing 46 states , including 52 Floridians . 
The 26 Broward County residents on board have been in isolation for 14 days , and they have agreed to isolate for another 14 days at home . 
The passengers on the ships are from the US , Canada , UK , Australia , France , Germany , Sweden , Mexico , Ireland , Switzerland , among others .
