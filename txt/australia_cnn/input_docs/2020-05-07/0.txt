Thousands of US Marines are expected to head to Australia in the coming weeks after the Australian government granted an exemption to Covid 19 travel restrictions , the US Marine Corps said in a statement . 
US Defense Secretary Mark Esper first announced in a tweet the resumption of the annual Marine Rotational Force Darwin , in which as many as 2,500 Marines are deployed to Australia ’s Northern Territory for six months during the country ’s dry season . 
The deployment had been suspended in late March after Australia closed its borders completely to all non citizens and non residents . 
The US Marines will undergo a 14 day quarantine and face other requirements , Chuck Little , a spokesman for US Marine Corps Forces , Pacific , said in a statement . 
Little did not say exactly when the deployment would resume or how many Marines would be going . 
But last year ’s deployment to the Australian base in Darwin involved 2,500 US Marines and this year ’s was expected to be similar . 
Equipment deployed during the 2019 rotation , which the Australian Defense Ministry called the most capable since the deployment began in 2012 , included MV 22 Osprey aircraft and advanced radars and artillery systems .
