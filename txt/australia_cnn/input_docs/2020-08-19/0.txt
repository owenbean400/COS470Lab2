Australia has secured a deal with the UK based drug company Astra Zeneca for access to a potential Covid 19 vaccine should trials prove successful . 
Astra Zeneca is currently developing a vaccine in partnership with Oxford University , and has already reached agreements with several governments -- including the US and UK -- to produce at least 2 billion doses , with the first deliveries starting as early as September . 
Under the deal , Australians would receive the vaccine for free , an Australian government statement said on Tuesday . 
" However there is no guarantee that this , or any other , vaccine will be successful , which is why we are continuing our discussions with many parties around the world while backing our own researchers at the same time to find a vaccine . " 
Speaking Wednesday , Morrison acknowledged that there were " big hurdles " in producing a successful vaccine but said the Astra Zeneca Oxford University project is " one of the best prospects in the world today . " 
There is no stated cost of the Australian government â€™s deal with Astra Zeneca ; however the Australian government has indicated that it will spend billions of dollars on its vaccine strategy . 
The strategy includes the purchase of 100 million needles , syringes and other consumables from US company Becton Dickinson , with an order already placed worth 24.7 million Australian dollars ( $ 17.9 million ) .
