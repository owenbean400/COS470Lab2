Authorities in Perth , Australia , told a planeload of domestic travelers on Sunday that they must either leave the state or undergo a two week self quarantine after the Western Australian ( WA ) government changed its border policy while they were mid flight . 
On Sunday the WA government added South Australia ( SA ) to its list of Australian States subject to a 14 day self quarantine , after SA announced three cases of community transmission in Adelaide . 
The airport was otherwise a scene of joyous reunions on Sunday , one day after a 222 day interstate hard border ended . 
The WA government introduced a so called " controlled border " on Saturday with other States of Australia , after shutting off travel from the rest of the country in March to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
Only international travelers , and domestic arrivals from the states of Victoria , New South Wales and SA will be forced into quarantine . 
The WA government released a statement Sunday and said the measures will be regularly reviewed . 
International travelers are still banned from entering Australia during the pandemic , unless they are citizens , permanent residents or have successfully applied for an exemption . 
Those who do return from overseas must undergo 14 days of strict hotel quarantine .
