China says it supports the resolution put forward to a World Health Organization meeting on finding the origins of Covid 19 and calling for an inquiry into the global response , but insists the draft resolution " is a totally different thing from what ’s been called an independent international inquiry . " 
Speaking at a daily press briefing , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said : " As the virus continues to spread across the world , passage of this resolution is aimed at supporting the key leadership role of the World Health Organization and focusing on international cooperation . " 
Zhao said China rejects " unilateral interpretation " of the resolution and believes that the focus should remain on the containment of Covid 19 , and that most member states agree it is not an appropriate time for an investigation due to the state of the pandemic . 
Here 's some background : About 100 countries have backed a resolution at the World Health Assembly ( WHA ) , calling for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic . 
The European Union drafted resolution comes on the back of a push by Australia for an inquiry into China 's initial handling of the crisis . 
Zhao dismisses Pompeo 's comments : When asked to comment on remarks by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that appeared to backtrack on a theory that the virus originated in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan , Zhao said : " This US politician has been spreading all kinds of lies for some time . 
Responding to his lies is a waste of everyone ’s time . "
