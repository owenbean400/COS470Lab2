More than 100 countries have proposed a draft resolution calling for an independent " evaluation " into the coronavirus pandemic . 
The resolution is to be presented to the World Health Organization during its 73rd World Health Assembly held virtually today and tomorrow . 
The motion has international support : Countries including Australia , India , New Zealand , Russia and the UK back the proposal , as do the European Union and its member states . 
But not from the United States : The US is not one of the signatories . 
Where does China fit into this ? 
The draft does not specifically mention China or Beijing , but China has been facing mounting international scrutiny for its initial handling of the Covid 19 outbreak . 
In April , Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne called for an independent investigation into the spread of Covid 19 and said " transparency from China most certainly " would be addressed . 
Chinese officials called the idea of an independent investigation politically motivated . 
Last week , China struck back at what it calls " lies " from US politicians , which it said were fabricated to " shift the blame to China for their inadequate response to Covid 19 . " 
China has repeatedly denied accusations of an initial cover up and delayed release of information about the virus .
