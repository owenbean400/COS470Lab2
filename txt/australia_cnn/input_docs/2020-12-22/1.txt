Four cases with the United Kingdom Covid 19 variant have been detected in Australia , the country 's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said Monday . 
Kelly stressed that after assessing the risk of travel from the UK with a panel of medical experts , there was " no need for this to be a cause of us changing any of our arrangements here in Australia , or to be concerned about people coming from the UK . " 
The chief medical officer said that Australia had decided not to shut off transport links with the UK because it already had robust quarantine arrangements for international arrivals . 
He described the quarantine rules as " our rings of containment , to protect the Australian public . " 
Strict immigration controls mean that only Australian citizens , permanent residents and people who reside in New Zealand have been permitted to travel to the country . 
International arrivals from places other than New Zealand need to spend 14 days in a state run quarantine at their own cost . 
Kelly said that medical experts in Australia had been monitoring mutations of the virus since the beginning of the pandemic .
