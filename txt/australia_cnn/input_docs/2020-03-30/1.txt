Hundreds of thousands of Britons are still struggling to return to the UK from overseas , Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said at a news conference . 
" Many travelers have not yet managed to get back home , from young backpackers to retired couples on cruises and we appreciate the difficult predicament they find themselves in , " Raab said . 
Raab said the first priority is to keep as many commercial flights running as possible . 
He urged airlines to offer alternative flights at little to no cost and told travelers " please book your tickets as soon as possible " if commercial airlines are still running . 
Raab said he had spoken to foreign ministers in countries such as Australia , New Zealand , India and Pakistan to urge them to keep commercial routes flying . 
" We â€™ve got a lot more to do , " he admitted . 
To give a sense of the scale of the task , Raab said 150,000 UK nationals have already returned from Spain , 8,500 travelers from Morocco and round 5,000 from Cyprus . 
Where commercial routes do not exist , the government will provide up to 75 million pounds ( approximately $ 92 million ) financial support to enable charter flights to fly to priority countries to bring back UK residents , Raab announced .
