People can hope for a mild flu season like that just experienced in the southern hemisphere , but they need to get vaccinated , too , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Tuesday . 
" One of the things we can say is that we should continue to encourage people to get vaccinated with the influenza vaccine , " Fauci said during an event sponsored by Research ! 
America . 
Australia had " one of the lowest rates of influenza infection in memory , " Fauci said . 
" If we can do that , I think that would be very favorable , " he added . 
" If what happened in the southern hemisphere happens here , that would be a very good and favorable thing , " Fauci added . 
Mask use , social distancing and hand washing have not only helped prevent the spread of coronavirus , but they likely helped stop the spread of flu , too , he said . 
If the US does have what Fauci calls a " full blown " flu season without getting control over the coronavirus , doctors , hospitals and others will struggle to tell the two infections apart . 
Plus , the sheer number of sick people could overwhelm the healthcare system . 
" That â€™s the reason why , when you have two coexisting infections during the winter months , it becomes problematic , " he said .
