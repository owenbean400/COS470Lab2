A blueprint to resume flights between Australia and New Zealand will be presented early next month , New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said . 
Politicians from Australia and New Zealand have been discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other , creating a travel corridor -- or " travel bubble " -- between the two nations . 
Ardern said the Trans Tasman Safe Border Group will present the blueprint in early June to both governments . 
The blueprint is expected to include issues such as pre flight health requirements , onboard aircraft protections , airport safety and contact tracing at arrival destinations . 
It 's not clear when the flights will resume -- currently both countries have closed their borders to most international visitors and all overseas arrivals are subject to a 14 day quarantine .
