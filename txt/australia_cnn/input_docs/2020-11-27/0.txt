India ’s national cricket captain , Virat Kohli , has hit back at criticism of his decision to take lengthy paternity leave from his team 's ongoing tour to Australia for the birth of his first child . 
Speaking in a news conference via video link on Thursday , Kohli explained that he will be subject to two quarantines when he travels home after the first test match of India 's first overseas series since the start of the pandemic . 
Kohli said his travel dates were " purely based on the fact that we have a quarantine period both ways . " 
The top order batsman added that the decision had been made with the support of the Board of Control for Cricket in India 's ( BCCI ) selection committee . 
Why the controversy ? 
Earlier this month , Indian cricket officials announced that Kohli would miss the final three test matches of the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia . 
It ’s been a talking point in India ever since , with some even questioning Kohli ’s patriotism . 
There has , however , been immense support for the Indian skipper ’s decision from former cricketers , international players and fans . 
The birth of Kohli 's first child with his wife , Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma , is expected in January .
