The Federal Reserve is opening up another avenue for stressed out foreign central banks to get access to US dollars during the coronavirus crisis . 
The new emergency program , announced today , is part of the Fed 's sweeping efforts to keep credit flowing to American businesses and households despite the severe economic shock inflicted by the pandemic . 
The US central bank said the new temporary repurchase agreement ( repo ) facility will let foreign central banks swap US Treasuries for US dollars . 
Those greenbacks can then be transferred to local banks in need of cash . 
The Fed said the new program , set to launch April 6 , would mostly be used " only in unusual circumstances such as those prevailing at present . " 
The goal is to lower the need for foreign central banks to dump US Treasuries in fire sales , which can disrupt markets and cause yields to rise . 
And that in turn lifts borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to credit cards . 
Demand for the US dollar , the world 's preeminent currency , has spiked during the crisis . 
In response , the Fed promised to provide cheap dollars to foreign central banks through liquidity swap lines . 
The Fed expanded that facility to Australia , Brazil and Mexico .
