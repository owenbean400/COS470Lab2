In Australia and New Zealand , there 's a high proportion of young people among those diagnosed with coronavirus . 
According to Australian government statistics : 21 % of confirmed cases are aged 20 to 29 16 % of cases are aged 30 to 39 31 % of cases are 60 or older In New Zealand : 26 % of confirmed cases are aged 20 to 29 14 % of cases are aged 30 to 39 21 % of cases are 60 or older For comparison , a report issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that analyzed the cases of 2,500 patients in the US whose ages were known , found that : 29 % were aged 20 to 44 18 % were aged 55 to 64 25 % were aged 65 to 84 So why is there a high proportion of cases among younger people in Australia and New Zealand ? 
One reason could be travel . 
In both New Zealand and Australia , the vast majority of cases are connected with overseas travel or links to known cases , meaning there is limited transmission in the community . 
Professor Peter Collignon , an infectious disease expert from the Australian National University , said the Australian data was a reflection of the demographics engaging in overseas travel , according to a report in The Guardian .
