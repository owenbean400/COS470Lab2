Fiji is planning to create a travel bubble with Australia and New Zealand , the South Pacific island nation 's leader said on Sunday . 
Prime Minister Josaia " Frank " Voreqe Bainimarama told parliament his plan for a " post Covid society " included a slow resumption of the tourism industry the country relies heavily on . 
" While Australia and New Zealand work out their trans Tasman bubble , Fiji 's equal -- or arguably , greater -- success against the virus puts us in a position to take the lead in the Pacific , " Bainimarama said . 
" We 're working on our own bubble -- a Bula Bubble -- between Fiji , New Zealand and Australia . " 
Bula is a greeting that means hello or welcome in Fijian . 
How it would work : Visitors from Australia and New Zealand would either need to show proof of a completed two week quarantine in their home country immediately before travel , or complete one in an approved hotel or government facility upon arrival . 
Arriving passengers will have to present a negative coronavirus test , completed no more than 48 hours before their flight . 
Visitors coming to Fiji on personal boats or vessels need to prove they have been at sea for at least 14 days , and will be tested for coronavirus upon arrival . 
Those who have not been will need to quarantine while docked in Fiji . 
Cruise ships are banned indefinitely .
