The US is putting a temporary pause on refugee admissions in light of the coronavirus pandemic , according to two sources familiar with an administration call Wednesday morning with refugee organizations . 
The move comes after the International Organization for Migration , which is in charge of booking refugees on their travel , and the UN refugee agency announced a temporary suspension of resettlement travel . 
The agencies shared concerns in a statement Tuesday , saying international travel " could increase the exposure of refugees to the virus . " 
There will be a moratorium on refugee admissions until April 7 , according to the sources . 
Wednesday will be the last day for refugee arrivals . 
By the numbers : As of Feb . 29 , there were 6,273 refugees admitted to the US this fiscal year . 
The State Department 's Bureau of Population , Refugees and Migration did not immediately respond to request for comment .
