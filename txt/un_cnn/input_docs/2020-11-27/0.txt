The UN 's migration agency , the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , has called on governments not to forget migrants as they start to plan coronavirus vaccination programs . 
Dr . Jaime Calderon , a senior regional health adviser for the IOM , told a meeting of the South Eastern Europe Health Network that migrants should be factored into public health and vaccination plans . 
" Vaccines are among our most critical and cost effective tools to prevent outbreaks and keep communities safe and healthy , " he said , according to an IOM news release Friday . 
The South Eastern Europe Health Network links countries including Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Montenegro , the Republic of Moldova , Romania , Serbia and North Macedonia , each of which is a source country and increasingly a transit country for migrants , the IOM says . 
" Some 30,000 migrants passed irregularly through the region this year , about the same as previous years , despite pandemic restrictions , " the news release said . 
Harsh winter weather conditions and seasonal flu are likely to place regional health services under great strain , the health forum heard . 
" This is bad news for the tens of thousands of migrants in the region , " said Calderon . 
" All too often , migrants encounter obstacles in accessing health services â€” due to language and cultural barriers , fees they cannot afford , and lack of inclusive health policies . "
