The number of people suffering acute hunger could almost double to more than 265 million because of the economic impact of coronavirus , the UN ’s World Food Programme ( WFP ) is warning . 
In a statement released Tuesday , the WFP said " swift action " was needed to stop this becoming a reality . 
" Covid 19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread . 
It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage , " WFP ’s Senior Economist Arif Husain said . 
" Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs . 
It only takes one more shock – like Covid 19 – to push them over the edge . 
We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe . " 
The latest report from the WFP says that in some countries , those most vulnerable to food insecurity have " very limited " capacity to cope with the shock caused by the pandemic . 
" These countries may face an excruciating trade off between saving lives or livelihoods or , in a worst case scenario , saving people from the coronavirus to have them die from hunger , " the report warns .
