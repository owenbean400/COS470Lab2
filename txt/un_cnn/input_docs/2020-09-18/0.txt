The United Nations estimates that millions of women and girls are " bearing the brunt " of the Covid 19 pandemic due to increases in cases of violence , disruptions in sexual and reproductive health services , income disruptions and stress faced by frontline workers . 
At the beginning of the pandemic , UNPF projected that six months of interruptions in family planning supplies could lead to 47 million women in developing countries being unable to use modern contraceptives , " thereby leading to 7 million unintended pregnancies , " Kanem said . 
Rising domestic violence : Some shelters for women affected by violence also have been shuttered . 
UNFPA projections estimate 31 million additional cases of violence against women and girls during a period of six months . 
Rates of femicide -- the gender based murder of a woman or girl by a man -- have doubled in certain countries , according to Kanem . 
" UNFPA sees gender based violence as a crisis within the bigger crisis of the pandemic , " Kanem said . 
" I 'm sorry to tell you that in far too many places , those predictions have absolutely become a reality . " 
On the front lines : Additionally , " women are bearing the brunt of the Covid crisis in more ways than one because women are on the frontlines of the crisis . 
The heroes that we are celebrating , 70 % of these human beings are female , and that 's true across the health and social service workforce globally , " Kanem said . 
" These are the people who are more likely to lose their source of income and less likely to be covered by social protection measures , " Kanem said , adding that the pandemic had laid bare " the very severe and systemic inequality that was under the tip of the iceberg . "
