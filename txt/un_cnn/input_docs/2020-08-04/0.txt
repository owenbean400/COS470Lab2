UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday that the world is facing a " generational catastrophe " because of school closures amid the coronavirus pandemic and " getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority " once local transmission of Covid 19 is under control . 
In mid July , schools were closed in more than 160 countries , affecting more than 1 billion students , he said . 
At least 40 million students worldwide have missed out on education in their critical pre school year . 
Learners with disabilities , those in minority or disadvantaged communities , displaced and refugee students , and those in remote areas are at highest risk of being left behind , he said . 
More than 250 million school age children were out of school before the start of the pandemic and only a quarter of secondary school children in developing countries were leaving school with basic skills , he said . 
The knock on effects on child nutrition , child marriage and gender equality , among others , are also " deeply concerning . " 
The campaign calls for action in four key areas , including reopening schools , prioritizing education in financing decisions , targeting the hardest to reach and focusing on creative and innovative ways of teaching .
