Russian medical supplies to help the US combat the Covid 19 pandemic landed in New York on Wednesday afternoon , the Russian mission to the UN tweeted out . 
The mission tweeted that the supplies would " help local communities and hospitals in their crucial action against the spread of # coronanvirus . " 
The New York Air Traffic Controller thanked the Russian pilot when the plane landed at JFK airport . 
The shipment includes personal protective equipment including masks , ventilators , and antiseptics a State Department official told CNN . 
The US will put all Food and Drug Administration approved items to immediate use , a senior administration official said on Tuesday . 
Some context : The shipment comes just days after President Trump and President Vladimir Putin spoke over the phone . 
The Russian assistance was not mentioned in the readout of their call provided by the White House . 
But earlier this week Trump said that " Russia sent us a very , very large planeload of things , medical equipment , which was very nice . " 
Last month , before that phone call , the State Department urged diplomats worldwide to ask for medical supplies from their host countries , but said that they would not be asking Russia .
