The coronavirus pandemic is the " greatest test " the world has faced since the United Nations was formed in the wake of World War II , said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres . 
Guterres said the world must work together if it is going to reduce the social and economic impact of the coronavirus on the global population . 
In response to the crisis , the secretary general said in a statement that he has established a dedicated Covid 19 Response and Recovery Fund to support the efforts of low - and middle income countries to stop local epidemics . 
The United Nations was founded in 1945 in the immediate aftermath of World War II by more than 50 countries with an aim of increasing cooperation between states and preventing conflict . 
It now has 193 member states .
