A leading United Nations human rights expert claims the Myanmar military is carrying out " war crimes " against ethnic minorities , emboldened by special extended powers intended to help control the spread of the coronavirus . 
Yanghee Lee , the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar , accused the military of targeting ethnic Rakhine Buddhist civilians during recent clashes with the Arakan Army , a separatist militant group in the western Rakhine State . 
Lee said that houses had been burned , a monastery was attacked and people had been arrested and tortured .
