Life was not easy for Patricia , even before the pandemic hit . 
She struggled with mental health issues after fleeing an abusive relationship , moving herself and her children into an east London flat with nothing more than the clothes on their backs . 
For the past few years , Patricia had held down a job as a barista , but she was furloughed after the Covid 19 crisis exploded and the United Kingdom went into lockdown . 
As the money got tighter , she found herself resorting to a food bank to help feed her family .

In 2019 , a report by Eurostat estimated that there were 92.4 million people in the EU who were at risk of poverty or social exclusion , equivalent to 21.1 % of the total population . 
Another Eurostat report from 2018 revealed that 33.4 million Europeans were unable to afford a meal with meat , fish , or a vegetarian equivalent every second day -- highlighting the sheer scale of the problem across Europe . 
And when the pandemic hit , things got even worse .
