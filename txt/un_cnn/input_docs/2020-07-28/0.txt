Nearly 7 million more children worldwide could suffer from acute malnutrition due to the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic , according to an analysis published Monday in the Lancet medical journal . 
Disruptions in mobility and food systems caused by even relatively short lockdowns will result in a decrease of nearly 8 % of gross national income ( GNI ) per capita compared to pre pandemic projections . 
A drop in the GNI per capita is associated with a rise in acute malnutrition or child wasting , which is low weight for height and a strong predictor of mortality among children under five , according to the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) . 
These projections suggest a 14 % increase in the number of children under 5 with moderate or severe wasting , meaning an additional 6.7 million could be affected this year compared to pre pandemic projections , UNICEF said . 
Nearly 130,000 additional deaths from wasting in children under 5 are projected , with more than half of them occurring in Sub Saharan Africa . 
Increased risk of malnutrition : Covid 19 " is expected to increase the risk of all forms of malnutrition , " the team at the Standing Together for Nutrition consortium wrote , adding their estimates are likely to be conservative as the duration of the pandemic is unknown . 
Nutrition services hit : Covid 19 has resulted in a 30 % reduction of essential nutrition services in low and middle income countries , leaders of four United Nations agencies said in accompanying comments . 
Some of these countries have seen a complete shutdown of these services during lockdown . 
The UN estimates a minimum of $ 2.4 billion is needed to treat and prevent child wasting . 
Call for urgent action : The UN called for five " urgent actions " to protect children 's right to nutrition during the pandemic , including maintaining school meals and expanding social protections that include diet services .
