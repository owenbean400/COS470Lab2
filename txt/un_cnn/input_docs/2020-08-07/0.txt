Libya reported 404 new coronavirus cases Thursday , a record high for the country . 
Libya has a total of 4,879 confirmed cases and 107 deaths , according to its National Center for Disease Control ( NCDC ) and Johns Hopkins University , but officials fear the case count could be much higher due to the country 's extremely limited testing capability . 
Last week , local authorities in the port city of Misrata declared a state of emergency after a significant increase in the number of cases there . 
Libya â€™s UN backed Government of National Accord extended a curfew for all areas under its control by another ten days , starting on Friday . 
The daily curfew will be from 9 p.m . to 6 a.m . local time , with a 24 hour curfew on Friday and Saturday . 
On Thursday , the government announced new preventative measures , including making the wearing of masks mandatory in public places and on public transport . 
Businesses have been ordered not to accept customers without face masks and must have clear social distancing instructions . 
Firms that do not comply with these measures or the curfew hours will face fines and suspension of licenses for repeated violations , the government said .
