The coronavirus pandemic is " wreaking havoc " across Arab countries , the United Nations ( UN ) warned Thursday . 
The UN said cases were rising alarmingly across the region , with 55 million people at risk from the virus and in need of humanitarian assistance . 
Among this group are 26 million refugees and internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) , ​ the UN said . 
The organization 's Secretary General António Guterres said in a statement that the pandemic had caused " an estimated 5 % contraction in the [ region 's ] economy , " with " one quarter of the population falling into poverty [ and ] 17 million jobs lost when 14.3 million adults of working age were already unemployed . " 
But Guterres said the crisis could " also be a moment for resolving long standing conflicts and addressing structural weaknesses " and urged Arab countries to take rapid measures to face the crisis . 
" Now is the time to take immediate measures to slow the spread of the disease , end the conflict and meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable , " he said . 
Guterres called for greater investment in " universal health and education ; social protection floors ; and technology , " with a particular focus on ensuring greater rights for women and more opportunities for the region 's young people . 
" Together , we can turn a crisis into an opportunity . 
It will be good for the region -- and good for our world , " he said .
