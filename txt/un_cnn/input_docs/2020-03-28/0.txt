Restrictive measures and lockdowns adopted by a number of countries for extended periods of time intensify the risk of domestic violence , the United Nations has warned . 
" It is very likely that rates of widespread domestic violence will increase , as already suggested by initial police and hotline reports , " UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women , Dubravka Simonovic , said in a statement Friday . 
" For too many women and children , home can be a place of fear and abuse . 
That situation worsens considerably in cases of isolation such as the lockdowns imposed during the Covid 19 pandemic , " she said , adding that this could also lead to increased number of " intimate partner femicides . " 
Simonovic said the risk is " aggravated " at a time when there are fewer or no shelters and help services available for victims . 
Less community support , fewer police interventions and less access to justice as many courts are closed are also contributing factors , she said . 
Furthermore , the emergency measures needed to fight the pandemic have increased women 's burden regarding domestic work and the care of children , elderly relatives and sick family members , Simonovic said . 
Simonovic expressed particular concerns about women at higher risk of domestic violence , such as women with disabilities , undocumented migrant women and victims of trafficking .
