The US ambassador to the UN in Geneva has urged the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to " engage directly with Taiwan public health authorities " in the fight against the coronavirus . 
There are at least 13 confirmed cases of the virus in Taiwan , which is not a member of the UN or the WHO . 
" For the rapidly evolving coronavirus , it is a technical imperative that WHO present visible public health data on Taiwan as an affected area and engage directly with Taiwan public health authorities on actions , " Andrew Bremberg told the WHO â€™s Executive Board on Thursday . 
The WHO responded that it is " collaborating closely with Taiwanese authorities through the International Health Regulations mechanism in response to the 2019 n Co V outbreak . " 
A spokesperson for the organization told CNN that the WHO " has received vital information from Taiwanese authorities and will be reporting back through established channels . "
