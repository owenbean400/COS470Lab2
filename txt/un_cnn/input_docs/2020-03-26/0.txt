As the coronavirus begins to strike in prisons and detention centers , the UN is urging governments " not to forget those behind bars " and protect the staff members working in those facilities . 
" Governments are facing huge demands on resources in this crisis and are having to take difficult decisions , " said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet in a statement Wednesday . 
She laid out measures that authorities could take : They could reduce the number of people in detention and examine ways to release particularly vulnerable detainees , like those who are older or already sick . 
Authorities overseeing these facilities should continue providing for the specific health care needs of women prisoners , including those who are pregnant , and those of inmates with disabilities and juvenile detainees , Bachelet added . 
If prisons restrict visits for inmates , they should set up alternative measures like video conferencing or increased phone calls with family members , she said . 
Prisoners ' rights need to be protected , she emphasized . 
Anti pandemic measures should not undermine the fundamental rights of detained people , including their rights to adequate food and water , and access to a lawyer and doctor .
