The United Nations has launched its $ 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan in the fight against coronavirus in the world ’s poorest countries . 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres outlined the plan saying it will be coordinated by the UN ’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , along with existing appeals from the World Health Organization and other UN partners . 
" Properly funded , it will save many lives and arm humanitarian agencies and NGO ’s with laboratory supplies for testing , and with medical equipment to treat the sick while protecting health care workers , " Guterres said . 
He added : Guterres said now is the time to help protect countries who are already in the midst of humanitarian crises , like conflicts , natural disaster and climate change , " We must come to the aid of the ultra vulnerable – millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves . " 
" This is a matter of basic human solidarity . 
It is also crucial for combatting the virus , " Guterres said .
