The coronavirus pandemic is impacting children 's health and standard of living globally , said climate activist and children 's rights proponent Greta Thunberg during CNN 's coronavirus town hall . 
Even children who do not get infected can feel the impact of the coronavirus in other ways , she said . 
For instance , school meals are many children 's main source of nutritious food -- meaning school closures pose a food access threat . 
" For many people in the world , they do not have access to clean water or sanitation , to soap , and they do not even have a house to stay home in . 
And it 's very hard for many to keep social distancing , " said Thunberg . 
She donated prize money to support children : Human Act , a Danish worldwide development organization , recently gave Thunberg $ 100,000 for her global activism , but she is now directing that money to the UN 's Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) . 
" We have launched a new campaign to help support UNICEF during the Covid 19 pandemic , " Thunberg said during the town hall . 
" And that is because during any crisis it is always the most vulnerable people who are hit the hardest , and that is children , especially in the global south , people in the poorest parts of the world . "
