A Beijing florist is enclosing a special gift in her Valentine ’s Day bouquets this year – a small bottle of hand sanitiser to ward off coronavirus . 
It has been a tough month for Cai Xiaoman . 
Sales are down 90 % in the midst of an outbreak that has infected more than 40,000 people in the country . 
People are staying at home , leaving shopping malls empty . 
Wearing a face mask , Cai carefully sprays her hands with alcohol and puts on a pair of gloves before packaging her flowers and adding hand sanitiser to the bouquets . 
She says she was inspired by a customer who asked her to sanitise a bouquet before she delivered it . 
Now she is now giving sanitiser to all her customers as a kind gesture . 
" I think this is very heart warming , and I want my customers to feel comfortable , " she says . 
" Because now the outbreak is severe , and everyone is scared . 
I hope this will end soon . "
