The Chinese president , Xi Jinping , has been noticeably absent from public view as his government scrambles to fight the coronavirus outbreak that claimed more than 400 lives and infected more than 20,000 people . 
His most recent public appearance was on 28 January when he met the director general of the World Health Organization in Beijing and said he was " personally commanding " the response to the outbreak . 
Yet Xi does not appear to be the face of the government â€™s fight against the virus . 
He has not been pictured visiting hospitals , doctors or patients . 
In the days after officials acknowledged the gravity of the crisis it was the premier , Li Keqiang , who visited Wuhan , the city at the centre of the outbreak . 
While photos of a long convoy prompted rumours over the weekend that Xi was on his way to Wuhan , he has yet to turn up .
