The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has launched an extraordinary attack on the World Health Organization during a private meeting in the UK , accusing it of being in the pocket of China and responsible for " dead Britons " who passed away during the pandemic , Dan Sabbagh and Heather Stewart write . 
Pompeo told those present he believed the WHO was " political , not a science based organisation " and accused its current director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of being too close to Beijing . 
Those present at the meeting on Tuesday said that Pompeo told his audience of 20 MPs and peers that he was saying " on a firm intelligence foundation , a deal was made " with China to allow Tedros to win election in 2017 . 
The secretary of state went on to to claim " when push came to shove , you ’ve got dead Britons because of the deal that was made " – without providing any further details . 
His remarks at the meeting organised by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank came in response to a question from Chris Bryant , one of two Labour MPs present in a meeting otherwise dominated by Conservatives , who had challenged him over the Trump administration ’s repeated decisions to quit multilateral organisations .
