Thousands of new year revellers packed into the centre of Wuhan , the Chinese city where Covid 19 was first detected , cheering and releasing balloons to welcome in 2021 . 
Police erected fences to try to prevent congestion around the city â€™s Customs House clock tower , but the measure was ineffective because of the large turnout of mainly young people . 
" 2020 has been a very difficult year for us because we have experienced the epidemic , especially in Wuhan , which is an unforgettable experience for us , " local resident Xu Du told AFP . 
Most of the crowd wore masks for the celebrations on Thursday evening , which included a light show . 
Wuhan was put under a strict lockdown for more than two months from late January , but has returned to normal life since the summer . 
Schools fully reopened in September . 
" China has controlled the epidemic very well now , " said reveller Li Yusu . 
" But there are still some other countries suffering from the virus . 
I hope other countries can get through this difficulty as soon as possible . " 
China has faced widespread criticism over its initial handling of the virus , which emerged in Wuhan , in the central province of Hubei , in December 2019 . 
The country has been accused of covering up the outbreak and allowing the virus to spread internationally . 
Beijing has also recently attempted to cast doubts on whether Covid 19 originated in Wuhan . 
On Monday , citizen journalist Zhang Zhan was jailed for four years for reporting on conditions inside Wuhan during the height of the outbreak . 
The city of 11 million people was forced into a tough lockdown from January to April and about 4,000 people died , according to Chinese figures .
