Lebanese protesters took to the streets in Beirut and other cities on Saturday in mostly peaceful protests against the government , calling for its resignation as the small country sinks deeper into economic distress . 
The protests come after two days of rallies spurred by a dramatic collapse of the local currency against the dollar . 
Those rallies degenerated into violence , including attacks on private banks and shops , the Associated Press reports . 
The local currency , pegged to the dollar for nearly 30 years , has been on a downward trajectory for weeks , losing over 60 per cent of its value . 
But the dramatic collapse this week deepened public despair over the already troubled economy , a crisis that was further compounded by the coronavirus pandemic . 
The government was faced with handling the coronavirus pandemic soon after prime minister Hassan Diab took office earlier this year , and implemented a lockdown lasting months . 
Diab â€™s government is supported by the powerful militant group Hezbollah and its allies , but has already been weakened by the economic crisis . 
In a speech Saturday , Diab urged the public to be patient , saying there were a great many political hurdles , including from rivals he said sought to undermine his government . 
Diab offered no solutions to the crisis , nor did he name his opponents , but said his government was working to fight corruption and uphold the power of the state .
