The Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte has sought to reassure Europe that forthcoming post pandemic recovery funds will be spent wisely to revive the battered economy after a crippling lockdown , Agence France Presse ( AFP ) has reported . 
The leader of Europe ’s third largest economy told AFP Italy ’s share of the € 750bn ( £ 671bn ) recovery plan agreed by the European commission would be the impetus to fix longstanding problems at home . 
Economists say entrenched structural problems have put the brakes on progress for decades . 
They include Italy ’s burdensome public bureaucracy , sub par infrastructure , including slow adoption of digital technology , and widespread tax evasion . 
Conte said : It ’s an opportunity for us to design a better Italy , to work on a serious , comprehensive investment plan that will make the country more modern , greener , and more socially inclusive . 
Italy is reeling from the economic effects of its lockdown . 
Conte added : I often say it ’s not a handout to benefit the current government , it ’s an investment we must make in Italy and in Europe for our children and grandchildren .
