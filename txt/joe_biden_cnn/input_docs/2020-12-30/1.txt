A lack of resources and little advanced planning has delayed vaccine distribution and administration in the United States , a member of the Biden Harris Transition Covid Advisory Board said in an interview Tuesday . 
" I 'd say we 're still not at the bottom of why all of the problems are there , " Gawande said . 
Gawande said there had not been the advanced planning and resources to stand up the vaccination sites and capabilities required . 
Gawande said he expects President elect Joe Biden to be " upfront about what the challenges are " and " transparent about where the bottlenecks are . " 
Operation Warp Speed had promised that 20 million doses of vaccine would be administered before January 1 . 
The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that just over 11 million doses have been distributed and only 2.1 million have been administered to people .
