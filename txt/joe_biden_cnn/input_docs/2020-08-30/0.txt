If elected president , Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden pledged that he would re launch " PREDICT , " a program launched after the 2005 H1N1 virus that was designed to help detect and combat potential pandemic threats like Covid 19 . 
The program , which was shut down in 2019 , focused specifically on the detection and discovery of " zoonotic diseases . " 
Some context : Biden has continually criticized President Trump on the campaign trail for shuttering the pandemic response office established under President Obama — officially called the Global Health Security and Biodefense unit — and promised to restore it if elected , so it is not surprising that he is now adding the " Predict " program to the list of pandemic response mechanisms he would reinstitute . 
Biden 's statement continued , " I will re launch and strengthen U.S . Agency for International Development 's pathogen tracking program called PREDICT , which Donald Trump eliminated . " 
The New York Times was first to report that Biden would restart this specific program .
