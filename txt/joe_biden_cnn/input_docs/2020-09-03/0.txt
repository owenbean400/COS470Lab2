Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden criticized US President Donald Trump 's response to the coronavirus crisis , saying the administration " has not shown much grit at all . " 
Biden said Trump has " no real plan " for how to reopen schools safely this fall . 
" He 's offering nothing but failure and delusions from the start to finish to American families and our children . 
They are paying the price for his failures , " Biden said . 
Biden laid out some of his school reopening plans , which he said were posted on his campaign website . 
The former vice president said the Trump administration is " starving schools of the needed funding . " 
Biden said that if elected president , he would also support additional funding for mental health in schools and funds to hire additional teachers as smaller classes mean " more educators are needed . "
