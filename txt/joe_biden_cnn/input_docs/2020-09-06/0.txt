As the death toll in the United States from the coronavirus pandemic approaches 200,000 , Harris attacked the Trump administration for " minimizing the seriousness " of the coronavirus outbreak and failing to do enough for millions of American struggling to make ends meet . 
The unemployment rate in the United States stands at 8.4 % , according to new Labor Department data released on Friday . 
That ’s down from a high of 14.7 % in April , but still far from the pre pandemic unemployment rate of 3.5 % in February . 
Harris continued to say she would not trust Trump ’s word alone on the safety and efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine , but said she " would trust the word of public health experts and scientists , " including Dr . Anthony Fauci . 
" Joe Biden and I have a plan , " Harris said on vaccine distribution . 
" Donald Trump does not . " 
Some context : Trump said on Friday he believed a coronavirus vaccine could " probably " come sometime in the month of October , though experts agree it is more likely to come in November or December . 
A new University of Washington coronavirus model , routinely cited by the White House in the early days of the pandemic , is now projecting more than 400,000 dead by the end of the year . 
Asked whether she believes states should mandate a coronavirus vaccine for public school students along with other vaccinations , Harris said she would listen to public health experts . 
Harris also declined to back a mask mandate on a federal level , instead vowing a " national standard . " 
" This is not about punishment . 
It 's not about big brother , " she said . 
" We have a president of the United States who made this a partisan issue . " 
Harris added : " The virus could care less who you voted for in the last election or who you plan to vote for in the next election . 
We need leadership that appreciates that , on certain issues , they should not be partisan . 
Wearing a mask certainly should not be one of them . "
