Even as talks over more economic relief are moving in a positive direction towards a deal , congressional leaders are still trading offers and going back and forth this morning as they try to finalize a proposal and jam it through Congress in days , several sources said . 
That means it 's quite uncertain when Congress will vote — and whether they will be able to tie the roughly $ 900 billion relief plan to a massive $ 1.4 trillion spending bill that Congress is trying to pass by the time government runs out of money Friday night . 
Whether Congress will have to pass another stop gap measure to keep agencies afloat remains to be seen . 
The top four leaders are expected to talk this morning by phone . 
On a conference call with House Democrats this morning , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signaled that the deal is not final yet but offered the general outlines of the proposal . 
There was not a lot of pushback on the call , and sources described the atmosphere on the call as positive . 
Pelosi blamed GOP insistence on lawsuit protections for businesses and others as a reason why state and local aid was not included in the proposal . 
She did point to other areas of the emerging proposal — school funding , vaccine distribution transportation projects — where states and localities would get money . 
She contended that Democrats will push again for state and local aid when Joe Biden assumes the presidency . 
One Democrat , Rep . 
Sean Casten of Illinois , urged the leadership to bring a stand alone bill to fund state and local governments to show where Democrats stand , a source on the call said .
