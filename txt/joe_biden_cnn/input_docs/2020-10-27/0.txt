President Donald Trump claimed a place in history Monday when Amy Coney Barrett 's confirmation secured a dominant conservative majority on the Supreme Court , but the pomp of his victory lap could not disguise the reality of a pandemic that has placed his presidency in deep peril a week before the election . 
A glittering ceremony on a crisp fall night at the White House carried deep political overtones that will only exacerbate the fury of Democrats who feel Republican maneuvering stole two Supreme Court seats . 
It will also inexorably drag the court further into toxic political combat that has already tainted its reputation for non partisanship . 
The event went ahead despite another Covid 19 hotspot in the White House , this time with Vice President Mike Pence 's staff . 
It framed Trump , smiling , alongside a new justice beholden to him for a lifetime appointment after the President warned he may contest an election he has already declared unfair in the Supreme Court . 
The next week or so will tell whether the party at the White House was a valedictory moment of glory for a President heading into the wilderness or heralds a much bigger celebration for a second White House term next week . 
The ceremony came at the end of a day in which Trump swept through Pennsylvania -- the key swing state that could be the kingmaker in the event of a close election in which he is currently trailing Democrat Joe Biden on the electoral map . 
He only mentioned the pandemic to mislead the country about the fast worsening emergency that has killed 225,000 Americans , as hospitals fill up and many states mark their highest new caseloads . 
He hopes his pageantry alongside Barrett on Monday night will motivate conservatives and spark a huge base turnout , though it could also provide more moderate voters , especially women , with another reason to spurn him .
