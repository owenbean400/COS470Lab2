America has chosen Democrat Joe Biden as its 46th president , CNN projected on Saturday afternoon , following an election that the former vice president sought to turn into a referendum on President Trump 's mismanagement of the pandemic . 
Three advisers to the President said Trump 's handling of the coronavirus was a massive factor in his election loss . 
A senior adviser said Trump 's dismissive attitude and misinformation about the virus alienated senior voters who rejected the President 's performance on Covid 19 . 
The adviser said Trump could never understand elderly voters were the most at risk for contracting and succumbing to the virus , making them fearful of how the President was responding to the pandemic . 
A separate adviser said Trump chose to reopen the economy rather than get the virus under control and suffered the consequences on November 3 . 
Biden 's victory comes a day after the US racked up more than 126,000 new daily coronavirus cases -- the highest one day tally yet , Johns Hopkins data show . 
As of Saturday morning , more than 9.7 million cases have been recorded in the US . 
America also reported more than 1,140 coronavirus deaths Friday , the fourth straight day that count has risen above 1,000 .
