President Trump , in his first public event since he was diagnosed with coronavirus , gave a brief campaign style speech from the balcony of the White House where he attacked Joe Biden and focused on his law and order messaging . 
Though members of the audience were mostly Black Americans — members of a group known as " BLEXIT " that was founded by conservative firebrand Candace Owens to encourage African Americans to leave the Democratic Party — the lines of Trump 's speech seemed aimed at White suburbanites who are not sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement . 
" If the left gains power , they will launch a nationwide crusade against law enforcement , " Trump said . 
Some context : Just as the US sees an upward trend in hospitalization rates , Trump invited some 2,000 people for the speech from a White House balcony , in just the latest sign that his staff and doctors are acquiescing to his desires rather than following public health guidelines and common sense . 
The large gathering follows Trump 's acknowledgment during a televised interview with Fox News Friday that he may have contracted the virus at one of the recent events at the White House . 
It 's unknown whether he 's still contagious , but Trump gave an incomprehensible answer about his latest coronavirus test results Friday .
