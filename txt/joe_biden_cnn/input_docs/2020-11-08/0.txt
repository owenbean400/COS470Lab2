Joe Biden plans to announce a 12 person coronavirus task force on Monday , two sources with knowledge told CNN . 
The task force will be headed by three co chairs : Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy , former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University â€™s Dr . Marcella Nunez Smith . 
The announcement , which will come just days after Biden was declared the winner in the presidential election , signals how seriously he plans to focus on the pandemic from the outset of his transition . 
Biden is not expected to announce cabinet nominations for weeks and may wait until control of the Senate is clear , the sources said . 
Biden has potential people in mind for most every top position , but the announcement of the task force underscores the priority he intends to place on that challenge .
