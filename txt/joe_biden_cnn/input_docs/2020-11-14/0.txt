The coronavirus pandemic is worsening around the United States , and what people do now will have a " profound impact " on controlling the spread of the virus , Dr . Vivek Murthy said Friday . 
" This is a grim day for the country , because we 're seeing cases skyrocketing , we 're seeing hospitals fill up and we 're also seeing the death toll march up , " Murthy , co chair of President elect Joe Biden ’s newly appointed transition coronavirus advisory board , said . 
But it ’s not too late to turn things around , Murthy told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer . 
The US hit new records Friday for both new daily diagnoses , at 184,514 and for people in the hospital , with 68,516 current hospitalizations according to the Covid Tracking Project . 
" What we do over these next few weeks is going to have a profound impact on whether this spread increases or whether we ultimately control the spread of this virus , " Murthy added . 
Murthy said it ’s important for people to wear masks , keep a distance from one another and wash their hands as the holiday season starts . 
" If you 're thinking about going home for Thanksgiving , ask yourself if you can observe these kind of precautionary practices , because if you ca not , then you may be putting yourself and others at risk , " he said .
