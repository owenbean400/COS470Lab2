The coronavirus pandemic is a national security threat and President Donald Trump is exacerbating it by refusing to cooperate with President elect Joe Biden ’s transition team , Dr . Celine Gounder , a Biden Transition Covid 19 Board member , said Friday . 
" I think we ’re looking at some couple really tough months ahead , " Gounder told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper . 
The number of Covid 19 infections and hospitalizations is skyrocketing , breaking records day after day this week for daily case counts and hospitalizations . 
Trump has so far refused to concede and begin the peaceful transition of power , even though Biden has been projected a clear winner .
