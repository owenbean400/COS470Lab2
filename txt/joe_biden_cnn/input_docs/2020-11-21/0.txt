It is " critical " that US President Donald Trump ’s administration share important information about coronavirus response and vaccine distribution with President elect Joe Biden ’s team , Michael Osterholm , a member of Biden ’s coronavirus advisory board , said Friday . 
Current coronavirus vaccine distribution plans are still preliminary and mainly focus on rolling out the first doses to health care workers , Osterholm told CNN ’s Erin Burnett . 
Osterholm , who is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , noted that vaccine hesitancy will be a major roadblock to successful vaccination . 
" This is why we have to today , begin working very , very hard at a community grassroots level to help communities understand why they want this , " he said .
