Moncef Slaoui , chief scientific advisor for Operation Warp Speed , told CNN that he thinks President elect Joe Biden â€™s plan to ask all Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office is a good idea . 
Slaoui said that everyone needs to take precautions , wear masks , wash their hands , keep their distance and " remain aware that this virus is a killer . " 
" We have a vaccine , there is light at the end of the tunnel but we will not all have the vaccine in our arms before May or June so we need to be very cautious and vigilant , " he added . 
More background : Biden told CNN on Thursday that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office , in a sign of how Biden 's approach to the virus will be dramatically different from President Trump 's response . 
" Just 100 days to mask , not forever . 
One hundred days . 
And I think we 'll see a significant reduction , " Biden said Thursday .
