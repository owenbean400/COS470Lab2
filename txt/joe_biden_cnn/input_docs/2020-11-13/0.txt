Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said the state would not participate in a nationwide lockdown and that he believes not much will change with respect to the virus if Joe Biden " ultimately becomes the next president . " 
Reeves said while the federal government may make recommendations , under the Stafford Act when you have emergencies , they have to be state managed , locally executed , and federally supported . 
Reeves said it had been " a particularly difficult week for me and for my family " after his youngest daughter Maddie tested positive for Covid 19 yesterday , amid " significantly higher numbers of cases in our state . " 
Reeves said Maddie was recovering well and that his two oldest daughters have " basically been in self isolation " since the middle of last week , because of a potential exposure . 
The state 's Department of Health reported 1,271 new cases of Covid 19 Thursday , for a total of 130,665 cases , and 17 new Covid 19 related deaths , for a total of 3,514 deaths .
