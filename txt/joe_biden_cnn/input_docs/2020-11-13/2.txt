A co chair of Joe Biden ’s coronavirus taskforce has assured the American people that the President elect will focus on targeted restrictions based on viral spread in particular areas , rather than a broad shutdown for the whole country . 
Dr . Vivek Murthy told the ABC 's " Good Morning America " on Friday that restrictions would be tightened or loosened depending on the local situation . 
The approach is one that several European countries had taken before implementing nationwide lockdowns . 
" Right now , the way we should be thinking about this is more like a series of restrictions that we dial up or down depending on how bad [ a ] spread is taking place in a specific region , " Murthy said . 
He gave New York City as an example , where interventions are being targeted down to the ZIP code . 
" We ’re not in a place where we ’re saying shut the whole country down , " he said . 
" We ’ve got to be more targeted . " 
If this does not happen , Murthy said , people will become more fatigued , schools wo not be open to children and the economy will be hit harder . 
" So , we ’ve got to follow science , but we ’ve got to also be more precise than we were in the spring , " he said .
