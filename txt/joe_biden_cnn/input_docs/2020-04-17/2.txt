Former Vice President Joe Biden said during CNN 's coronavirus town hall that it was a " false choice " to have to choose between the economy and peoples ' health . 
The question from CNN 's Dr . Sanjay Gupta : " I 'm hearing once you start opening things back up , people are going to get infected , some may have to go to the hospital and some may sadly die . 
How would you make those decisions ? " 
Biden : " I err on the side of caution . 
Look , I think it 's a false choice to say you have to choose between the economy and our health . 
If you do not fix the health side of it , the economy is never going to get right . 
You 're never going to be in the place where you get to remotely a new normal . " 
On small businesses : " We want small business to be able to stay in business , " Biden said of hairdressers , coffee shops , nail salons and hardware stores . 
" If these little guys go out of business , they 're out of business . 
They 're not coming back , likely . " 
On keeping jobs : " We should think about how we do the economy in a different way , " Biden said .
