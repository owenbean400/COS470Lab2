US President elect Joe Biden will leave it to health experts to decide who gets the Covid 19 vaccine first , Dr . Celine Gounder , a member of Biden ’s coronavirus advisory board , said Friday . 
There will likely be a limited supply of coronavirus vaccine doses available immediately after a vaccine is authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) will recommend groups to receive the vaccine first . 
" That ’s where it gets a bit more political and frankly , this is where the President elect is leaving it to the public health experts and scientists to figure out how best to allocate the limited supply first . " 
The ACIP called an emergency meeting for Dec . 1 , where they will vote on the very first group to get a vaccine .
