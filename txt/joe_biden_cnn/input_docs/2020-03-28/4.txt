Joe Biden on Friday night said the Trump administration has taken a fundamentally flawed view of the crisis . 
Trump has repeatedly cast efforts to combat the virus as the cause of economic troubles and suggested that he would ease up on public health efforts , like social distancing , ahead of medical experts ' recommendations . 
Trump has suggested he would like to " open up " the economy by Easter , but Biden pointed to the ongoing upward trend in cases , suggesting people will likely have to stay home significantly longer . 
" They 're one and the same -- you ca not deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the healthcare crisis , " Biden said , before calling on the government to get stimulus funds to the publics . 
" In the meantime , Congress has acted and they moved with a $ 2 trillion package on top of the one they already passed , " he said . 
" And it 's about managing , about getting that out to the people . 
Getting that out in the communities . 
Getting that distributed . "
