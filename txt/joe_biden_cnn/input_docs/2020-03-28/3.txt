Joe Biden said he ’s trying to get through his days just like anyone else with a stay at home order at his home in Wilmington , Delaware . 
The former vice president said his morning starts with a conference call with his campaign ’s medical team where they give him a briefing on the latest Covid 19 numbers that spans 20 minutes to an hour . 
That briefing covers " how much has been done…equipment we can get to people . " 
The medical briefing is followed by another meeting with his economic team , including economists who worked with him in the White House , about the recent legislation passed and " what the Trump administration has done , has not done . " 
Biden said he speaks to all five of his grandkids either by phone or text . 
The two children who live a mile from his home walk through the woods to Biden ’s house . 
Sometimes , Biden said , he and his wife Jill walk the track at a nearby school with their dog . 
" I am doing things like we are doing with you now . 
I ’m trying to keep abreast , and trying to keep on top of our President , and trying to do things that could ’ve been done , or doing faster , " he said .
