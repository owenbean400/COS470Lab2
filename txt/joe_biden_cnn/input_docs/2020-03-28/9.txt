Joe Biden said Friday that he believes there is " no distinction " between the physical and mental health problems that stem from coronavirus , acknowledging the increasing rates of anxiety and depression as the country uses social isolation to combat the spreading virus . 
Biden said he has heard not only about the anxiety that comes from being forced to stay home for long stretches of time , but also the " fear of going into the operating room or the physical fear of pulling someone out of a burning car that , in fact , may also have had the virus . " 
The comment stemmed from a question clinical psychologist and professor from Chicago , who asked the former vice president about the mental health impact of being socially isolated as the country fights coronavirus . 
Biden also said , as president , he would force insurance companies to cover physical and mental health equally and " open a significant number of mental health clinics " in rural America . 
" In most rural areas , there 's still the same problems as every other area but they do not have these clinics available to them , " Biden said , " so I double the number of mental health clinics that exist . " 
And , lastly , Biden said he would increase spending on early childhood education because teachers and social workers can " pick up the early signs of distress among students . "
