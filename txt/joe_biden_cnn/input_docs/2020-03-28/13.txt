Former US Vice President Joe Biden is not letting the threat of coronavirus stop him from keeping in touch with his five grandchildren . 
At a CNN town hall Friday , Biden revealed how he , like many Americans , is trying to stay connected to family members while also following social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus . 
" Every single day , I speak to all five of my grandkids . 
Either on the phone , or I text with them , " the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN 's Anderson Cooper . 
Two of Biden 's grandchildren -- children of his late son Beau -- live walking distance from the former vice president 's home in Wilmington , Delaware . 
They take a short walk through the woods and a neighborhood to see their grandparents , Biden said . 
" We sit on our back porch and they sit out on the lawn with two chairs there , and we talk about everything that is going on in their day . 
And talk about being home from school . 
And who 's driving whom crazy . 
And so on and so forth , " Biden said . 
" But at least I get to see them . " 
Biden has continued to run his presidential campaign from his home in Wilmington , making television appearances and conducting live streams from a home studio .
