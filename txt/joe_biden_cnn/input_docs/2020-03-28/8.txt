Joe Biden said the House and Senate should expand on the stimulus deal Congress approved this week to cover all Americans â€™ coronavirus related health care expenses . 
" Anything related to the cost of the coronavirus health care should be free , paid for out of the federal funds , " Biden said in a CNN town hall Friday night . 
His comment came as he addressed questions about health expenses amid the pandemic . 
Biden called on President Donald Trump and Republican state attorneys general to drop their lawsuit challenging Obamacare , through which millions of Americans have health insurance . 
He also said he has proposed a plan that would provide coverage through a " public option " to anyone who loses their jobs as a result of a struggling economy . 
" But in the meantime , with regard to this virus , you should not have to pay anything for the cost of the virus , " Biden said .
