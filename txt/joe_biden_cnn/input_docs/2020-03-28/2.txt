Joe Biden said he ’s spoken with several governors in recent days " to see what ’s happening on the ground for them " as their states react to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Biden named four Democratic governors with whom he has spoken : Washington ’s Jay Inslee , a one time 2020 presidential rival ; 
Michigan ’s Gretchen Whitmer , who is one of four co chairs of Biden ’s campaign ; 
Pennsylvania ’s Tom Wolf ; and Louisiana ’s John Bel Edwards — who Biden said he ’d missed a call from earlier Friday afternoon . 
The former vice president also said he has spoken with Republican governors . 
Trump earlier Friday had singled out Inslee and Whitmer for criticism , saying they had not been appreciative enough of federal efforts as their states have become epicenters of the growing crisis . 
" I want them to be appreciative , " Trump said . 
He said he instructed Vice President Mike Pence not to speak with Inslee and Whitmer — but Pence has done so anyway . 
" I say ‘ Mike , do not call the governor of Washington , you ’re wasting your time with him . 
Do not call the woman in Michigan , ’ " Trump said .
