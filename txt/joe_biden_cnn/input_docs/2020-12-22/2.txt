Sen . 
Chuck Schumer , the top Democrat in the Senate , said that he spoke to President elect Joe Biden and they agreed that the stimulus bill that passed yesterday is just the beginning of what is needed . 
Schumer said at a news conference in New York on Tuesday that he expects that Biden will begin working toward another stimulus package in January or February of 2021 . 
Schumer emphasized that the stimulus bill that passed last night provided enough money for vaccine distribution , but that more money will be needed for state and local aid . 
While the stimulus bill provided funding for schools and transportation , the legislation did not include the kind of direct cash to state and local governments that the CARES Act did in the spring . 
It was a provision that was dropped along with liability when lawmakers were racing against the clock to get a deal . 
" We are going to need more money . 
This bill is an emergency bill , " Schumer said . 
" It â€™s a survival bill . " 
" Make no mistake about it , we are going to have to come back and get more , " he added .
