Over the past two weeks , an alarming 24 % rise in the number of new Covid 19 cases confirmed on a daily basis in the United States has raised the daily infection average to nearly 43,000 . 
Twice last week the US broke 50,000 new cases confirmed in a day . 
While that 's below the daily average of 65,000 in July 's deadly spike , it 's still well above the 35,000 daily new cases seen just a few weeks ago . 
Does that mean Donald Trump is now going to stop having rallies where he jams thousands on top of each other with few wearing masks -- as he did Saturday night in Pennsylvania -- and instead promote social distancing to prevent any further upticks in the virus ? 
Stop laughing . 
Of course it does not . 
Trump typically only does what he believes benefits himself personally and , in this case , he apparently believes the optics of holding packed rallies will somehow help his flailing campaign close the nine point gap between him and Democratic nominee Joe Biden . 
Instead , Trump 's latest ploy is to try to convince voters into believing he did a great job handling the virus -- and the worst part is he 's using our tax dollars to do this . 
As Politico recently reported , Trump 's Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) is moving quickly to roll out a $ 300 million plus advertising campaign to " defeat despair " about Covid 19 . 
The campaign will include celebrities like actor Dennis Quaid and singer Ce Ce Winans and Politico reported that HHS is said to be pursuing television host Dr . Mehmet Oz and musician Garth Brooks to take part as well .
