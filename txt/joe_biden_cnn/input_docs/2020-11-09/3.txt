President elect Joe Biden and Vice President elect Kamala Harris have unveiled the group of public health experts that will make up their coronavirus advisory board . 
The team is chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy , who served in the Obama administration and also includes Rick Bright , a whistleblower from the Trump administration who alleged that his early warnings about the pandemic were ignored . 
Bright was the former director of the office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine . 
He said his early warnings about critical supplies shortages were met with skepticism from Trump administration officials . 
The inclusion of Bright on the board signals Biden 's attempt to take the US ' Covid 19 strategy in a different direction to President Trump who has regularly downplayed the impact of the virus . 
Both Biden and Harris will receive a briefing from the advisory board on Monday afternoon . 
The announcement comes as the US nears 10 million reported coronavirus cases .
