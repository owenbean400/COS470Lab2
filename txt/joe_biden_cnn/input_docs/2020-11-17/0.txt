US President elect Joe Biden â€™s coronavirus task force has yet to talk to the current administration about the transition , but is " very open " to doing so , said Dr . Marcella Nunez Smith , co chair of the task force , at a news conference on Monday . 
Nunez Smith said the task force is working very closely with policy teams and that the work of the transition is " driven by the data , by evidence , by science . " 
Emphasizing vulnerable groups : Nunez Smith said the task force was examining how Covid 19 disproportionately affects vulnerable populations like people of color , and those who work in high risk places such as medical settings , nursing homes , and prisons . 
On vaccines : She warned that the US is still many months away from full scale distribution of a vaccine , and that people need to continue taking precautions like wearing masks and social distancing . 
If hospitalization numbers continue rising , it could overwhelm hospitals that are already strained . 
" Our most precious and valuable resource right now is our healthcare system , " she said .
