Many pundits and politicians have been asking why the US military is not doing more to help combat the spread of the coronavirus in the US . 
On Sunday , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo called on President Trump to mobilize the military to help deal with the outbreak . 
This follows after former Vice President Joe Biden said the Department of Defense should be planning to deploy . 
Defense officials say their first priority is maintaining the health , welfare and " readiness " of the 1.36 million members of the active duty military , as well as the 800,000 members of the National Guard and Reservists in addition to some 730,000 civilian employees in the Department of Defense . 
And while some National Guard units have been involved in helping with logistics and planning at the state level , the US military 's capacity to provide medical support is limited . 
By the numbers : There are 51 military hospitals compared to some 6,000 civilian hospitals nationwide , according to one US defense official , meaning the US military has only about 1 % of the nation 's hospital capacity . 
Military hospitals admit some 200,000 patients annually as compared to civilian hospitals which admit about 36 million .
