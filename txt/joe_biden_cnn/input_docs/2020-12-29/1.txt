Asked on Tuesday what President elect Joe Biden needs to do to turn the coronavirus pandemic around , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's leading infectious disease expert , told CNN ’s Jim Sciutto that if everybody follows Biden 's plan to wear masks for the first 100 days that he is in office , and if people " put aside the nonsense " of masks being political , the curve will come down and the US will get better control of coronavirus . 
" I think what he is actually doing , showing leadership from the top and talking about the importance of essentially pleading with Americans , ' let 's do this , let ’s take 100 days ' — it ’s going to be more than 100 days — but what he ’s saying is that let ’s take at least 100 days and everybody — every single person — put aside this nonsense of making masks be a political statement or not , " said Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Fauci added : " We know it works , we know social distancing works , we know avoiding congregate setting works . 
For goodness sakes , let ’s all do it , and you will see that that curve will come down and we will get better control . 
There is no doubt about it , that if we do that , so let ’s just do it . " 
About Biden 's plan : In an interview with CNN 's Jake Tapper , the President elect said he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office .
