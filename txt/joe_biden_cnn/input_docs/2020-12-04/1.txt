Dr . Celine Gounder , a member of the Biden Harris transition Covid 19 advisory board , said the politicization of masks needs to stop in order for President elect Joe Biden â€™s 100 day mask plan to work . 
" So , if what you care about is being able to continue to go to work , have your paycheck , you know , all of those kinds of basic things , then you really should be working with us , working with your family , your community , to get everybody to wear a mask , " she added . 
Biden yesterday announced he 'll urge everyone in the US to wear masks during the symbolic first 100 days of his presidency Additionally , Gounder said that Biden 's strategy for approaching this pandemic will be different by scaling up testing . 
" You 're going to see much more emphasis on testing . 
The current administration has said we are testing too much , and the fact is , we are not testing nearly enough , " Gounder said .
