President elect Joe Biden will herald the scientific success of the Covid 19 vaccine tonight in a speech to the nation following the Electoral College vote that affirmed his election win â€” but he is not expected to shed any more light on when he will be vaccinated . 
Biden , 78 , has repeatedly said he will get the vaccination whenever Dr . Anthony Fauci declares it safe to do so . 
Of course , that has happened , along with the Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
But advisers to Biden say the timing of the vaccination is still being worked out . 
He is expected to receive the vaccine in a public way , as part of his effort to persuade Americans of its safety , but the details are still being discussed in conversations with Fauci , his doctor and other officials . 
He also intends to focus his message tonight on the grim American death toll , rather than his own vaccination plans . 
While no one suggests Biden should not receive it , one aide said optics were at play , and they wanted frontline workers to get it in the first few days . 
He is not expected to mention his own plans for a vaccination tonight , but look for that to come into sharper focus in the coming days . 
It is the expectation that he will get it soon , an adviser says , but likely not imminently . 
With the two shot requirement , aides say , time is an issue here if Biden wants to be fully vaccinated before taking office in five weeks .
