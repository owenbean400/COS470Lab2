US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday that he wants to get vaccinated against Covid 19 as soon as he can . 
Azar added that he would be " delighted " for any public official to get vaccinated on TV . 
Tapper said that President elect Joe Biden announced he would do so when his time comes to get vaccinated . 
" If President elect Biden comes to you , would you inoculate him , would you vaccinate him ? 
Or perhaps have somebody do so ? " 
Tapper asked Azar . 
" Of course we would , " Azar said . 
" Any of those types of efforts that signal to the American people the importance of getting vaccinated and that we as leaders are willing to put our money where our mouth is â€” of course we 'd be very supportive of that and make sure that would happen . "
