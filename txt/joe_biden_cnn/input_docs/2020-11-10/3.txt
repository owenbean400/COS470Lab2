Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) acting director Dr . Richard Besser said Tuesday that he was optimistic that the pandemic response will soon be under new federal leadership , noting that in the meantime , states need to step up . 
President elect Joe Biden has named a new coronavirus advisory board to help with the pandemic response as he transitions into the presidency . 
Besser said he was optimistic knowing " that politics will follow public health , instead of public health being told to change their recommendations to suit politics . " 
Besser , who heads the health focused Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , said he was glad to see that those appointed to the advisory board are prioritizing equity . 
" To hear the Vice President elect talking about the importance of equity , not being something on the side , but being central to how you think about this response -- to me , that 's huge , " he said . 
Besser said that the challenge will be getting through a difficult winter with the coronavirus response still led by the Trump administration . 
" I hope that governors now of both red and blue states step up , mandate masks , look to see what they can do within their own states , recognizing that the federal response and unified federal response is still several months away , " he said . 
" There are tens of thousands of lives that could be saved if states drive this forward and do the right thing . "
