The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention knows how to get people vaccinated , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Thursday . 
The infectious diseases expert said he ’s confident that the agency can get Americans vaccinated once a Covid 19 vaccine becomes available , even if the presidential transition of power has not started . 
The CDC vaccinates 80 million people a year , Fauci said . 
Fauci , who has been part of five transitions of presidential power over his 36 years as a federal scientist , would not talk directly about President Donald Trump ’s refusal to concede the election to President elect Joe Biden and whether that would impact potential coronavirus vaccinations . 
" Transitions are obviously important , " he said . 
" You do better with transitions . 
I 've been through them and I know . " 
Fauci likens presidential transitions to a relay race . 
" When you 're running in a relay race , you have the baton , you give it to somebody who 's not standing still . 
You give it to somebody that 's actually starting to run . 
That makes the smooth transition , " he said . 
" Of course , that 's better than not doing it that way . "
