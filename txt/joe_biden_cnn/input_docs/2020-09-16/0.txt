US President Donald Trump contradicted his administration ’s top health advisers call for Americans to wear facial masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus , saying during a town hall hosted by ABC on Tuesday that " there are a lot of people that think that masks are not good . " 
Trump was asked why he has not supported a national mask mandate and why he does not wear one more often . 
Trump said he does wear masks " when I have to . " 
He also blamed Democrats and Joe Biden for not instituting a national mask mandate , as though Biden was in office . 
" They said at the Democrat ( ic ) National Convention they ’re going to do a national mandate . 
They never did it , because they ’ve checked out and they did not do it . 
And … Like Joe Biden . 
They said ‘ We ’re going to a national mandate on masks . ’ 
… But he did not do it . 
He never did it . " 
Asked by ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos for a specific example , Trump said waiters . 
" They come over , they serve you and they have a mask . 
And I saw it the other day , where they were serving me and they ’re playing with mask . 
I ’m not blaming them … they ’re playing with the mask … they ’re touching it and then they ’re touching the plate . 
That ca not be good , " Trump said . 
Then Trump cited early statements from federal officials discouraging mask use , as though top federal health officials have not underscored to the public that science has evolved on the issue . 
In July , Trump said he was " all for " wearing face masks , despite refusing to wear one in public .
