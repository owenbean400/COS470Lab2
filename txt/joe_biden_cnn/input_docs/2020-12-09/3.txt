Democratic Sen . 
Joe Manchin said Wednesday that Congress is " not going to fail " in getting a Covid stimulus bill passed . 
" We 're not going home until we do get one , " Manchin told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . 
" Remember , this is called a Covid emergency relief package . 
It 's not called a do all , end all package . 
This is called what Joe Biden has said , this is a down payment on what is needed . " 
Manchin is a member of a bipartisan group of lawmakers that proposed a coronavirus emergency relief framework aimed at helping Americans affected by the pandemic . 
On CNN 's " The Situation Room , " the West Virginia senator went on to lay out some of the stumbling blocks to an agreement . 
Liability Protection : " I do not think there 's a Democrat or a Republican believes that anyone in a small business should be sued out of existence . 
But on the other hand , you have to have a safe workplace . 
You have to have worker conditions that are safe . 
You ca not throw the baby out with the bath water and say you get total amnesty , anything you want to do . 
We think there 's a way . 
We have all of our lawyers working . 
That should be done . " 
Funding state and local governments : " A lot of my Republican friends do not think the state and locals need anything . 
The only thing I 've said , this is based on need . 
We 're not sending money for the sake of sending money . 
We 're saying , show us your need . 
This is what you qualify for . 
But you 're not going to be able to spend it or use it if you do not have a loss of revenue , excessive Covid expenses . "
