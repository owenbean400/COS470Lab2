The US job market continues to suffer , and Thursday brought bad news . 
Another 885,000 people filed for first time unemployment benefits last week â€“ an increase from the week prior and higher than the 800,000 claims that economists were expecting . 
The latest figures , which are adjusted for seasonal factors and reported by the Labor Department , are particularly grim since last week 's numbers were revised up to 862,000 . 
And even before the revision , that week had been the highest level since mid September . 
The report comes at a tenuous time for America 's economy . 
The last round of Covid related financial aid from Washington has run out , and Congress is trying to deliver another stimulus package to struggling consumers and businesses in the lame duck session before Joe Biden is inaugurated . 
Economists and investors are excited about the prospects for a rebound in 2021 now that there is an approved coronavirus vaccine that a few have already received . 
But many Americans still need help now , a fact not lost on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell .
