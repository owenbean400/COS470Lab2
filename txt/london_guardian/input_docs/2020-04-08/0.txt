Mc Lean is speaking now . 
One chart shows footfall across 17 rail stations through the month of March , which was down 94 % by the end of March compared with the first week . 
The number of new cases day by day is " not accelerating out of control " . 
This is good news . 
The number of people in hospital beds with Covid 19 is highest in London , followed by the Midlands . 
This is a slower responding record of new infections , but the rate at which it is rising is " definitely getting slower " and " looks like we â€™re beginning to get towards a flat curve " .
