Schools in the UK are not set to reopen and will instead remain closed for the foreseeable future , government sources in Cardiff and London have told the Guardian , despite reports that a change was being considered . 
Officials confirmed that schools would only reopen once the scientific advice was in favour , and that they would remain closed after the Easter holidays ended , which for most state schools would be on 20 April . 
Some head teachers say their staff remain too vulnerable for reopening , and others were concerned that the shutdown was being undermined by an academic study suggesting that school closures only had a narrow impact on the spread of infection .
