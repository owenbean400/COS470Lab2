A senior executive at one of Britain ’s biggest outsourcing companies has told workers he believes coronavirus is " less severe " than normal influenza in a message explaining why they will not receive any special sickness benefits . 
During a negotiation with a trade union last week over sick pay for refuse collectors during the pandemic , a head of human resources at Amey plc , a services company with prison , defence and council contracts and a £ 2.3bn a year turnover , said that " when compared with many other diseases such as normal influenza , the impacts [ of Covid 19 ] on the individual are currently actually less severe " . 
The claim was described as " shocking " by the GMB trade union , which was negotiating for better sick pay on behalf of refuse collectors in the London borough of Ealing , where the company has the waste contract . 
Despite being classed as key workers by the Cabinet Office , the rubbish collectors are only being offered the contractual minimum , which in many cases is understood to be statutory sick pay of £ 94.25 a week .
