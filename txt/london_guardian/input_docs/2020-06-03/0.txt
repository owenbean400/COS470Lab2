The British prime minister Boris Johnson will host a global vaccine summit on Thursday , urging nations to pledge funding for vaccinations against infectious diseases to help the poorest countries tackle the pandemic . 
Representatives of more than 50 countries , including 35 heads of state or government , will come together virtually in London to raise funds for the GAVI vaccine alliance , a public private global health partnership . 
The summit aims to raise at least $ 7.4bn ( £ 6bn ) for GAVI to immunise a further 300 million children in the world ’s poorest countries by 2025 against diseases such as polio , diphtheria and measles . 
Johnson said : Just as the UK is the single biggest donor to the international effort to find a coronavirus vaccine , we will remain the world ’s leading donor to GAVI , contributing £ 1.65bn over the next five years . 
I urge you to join us to fortify this lifesaving alliance and inaugurate a new era of global health cooperation , which I believe is now the most essential shared endeavour of our lifetimes .
