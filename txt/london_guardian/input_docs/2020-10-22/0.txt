A painting by British artist David Hockney , sold by the Royal Opera House in London to raise essentials funds for the venue , fetched nearly £ 13m at auction . 
The painting , which depicts the iconic UK institution ’s former chief David Webster , had been estimated to sell for between £ 11m ( $ 14m , € 12m ) and £ 18m . 
At an evening auction of post war and contemporary art at Christie ’s in London , the work - Portrait of Sir David Webster - went under the hammer for £ 12,865,000 . 
The Royal Opera House announced earlier this month that it had been forced to sell the painting as it faces " the biggest crisis in our history " due to the coronavirus . 
" The proceeds will be used to ensure that the world ’s greatest artists can once more return to our stages , " its chief executive Alex Beard said at the time . 
The world renowned opera house closed its Covent Garden doors in late March as Britain went into a months long nationwide lockdown as Covid 19 spread across the country . 
It reopened in June without live audiences , instead streaming performances online as part of a four pronged recovery plan which includes redundancies and other cost cutting . 
It has also launched a fundraising campaign among audiences and supporters " to sustain our community of artists " . 
But income has fallen by more than half since the pandemic began . 
Under pressure from the cultural sector , the government recently released an aid package of £ 1.57bn ( $ 2.03bn , € 1.72bn ) but many have branded it insufficient . 
The Hockney painting sold depicts Webster - who ran the opera house from 1945 to 1970 - and was commissioned for the building in the 1970s .
