There is no need for people to panic about the coronavirus , said Scotland ’s public health minister as he visited one of the country ’s two testing laboratories . 
Joe Fitz Patrick said there was no current evidence to suggest it is necessary for people in Scotland to wear masks to protect against the Covid 19 virus . 
Screening laboratories in Glasgow and Edinburgh have tested 202 possible cases since testing began in Scotland on 10 February , with all proving negative . 
Combined with the previous tests at the Public Health England facility in Colindale , London , 290 tests from Scotland have been carried out since the outbreak began , with none coming back positive . 
Fitz Patrick said although it is likely there will be a case of coronavirus in Scotland , the country is well prepared to deal with the situation . 
There is no need for people to be panicked . 
We are clear that this is a serious threat that we are taking seriously and we ’re preparing for worst case scenarios but right now the risk in Scotland , as in the rest of the UK , remains low so there ’s no evidence to suggest that people should be walking around Scotland wearing face masks at this time . 
He added : " Although all Scottish tests have so far been negative , we are prepared for the high likelihood that we will also see a positive case . 
We have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and have been preparing for this possibility since the beginning of the outbreak .
