The Million Mask March , an annual event , was given added impetus by a new protest movement in opposition to lockdowns which has been building since late summer . 
Must be a couple of thousand people are on this # millionmaskmarch , where crowds are chanting freedom . 
Strong anti # lockdown vibes . 
Police were apparently struggling to control the largely spontaneous protest . 
Officers were trying to order those taking part to return home and picking some protesters from the crowd and arresting them . 
Police have kettled a group of protesters on Oxford Street . 
Four protesters , one of whom was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask , were arrested by police officers near the gates of Charing Cross Station . 
A number of police vans lined the Strand near the station as officers continued to urge people to go home . 
A tweet by the Metropolitan police said : A large group of protesters have moved off from # Trafalgar Square and are ignoring officers directions . 
This gathering is unlawful and is putting others at risk . 
We are directing those there to go home . 
Failure to do so will result in enforcement action . 
Protesters chanted " freedom " and " take your freedom back " as police chased the crowd through soho and other central London districts .
