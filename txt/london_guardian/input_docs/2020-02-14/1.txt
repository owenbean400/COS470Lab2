As many as eight flights at Heathrow Airport were said to have been caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials responding to coronavirus related concerns over passengers feeling unwell . 
United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard . 
A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before passengers were allowed to disembark after half an hour . 
" There was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and would be taken off , " said Andy West , a public relations executive at Hotwire , told the Guardian . 
" Shortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the plane . "
