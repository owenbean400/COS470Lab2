Here ’s a dispatch from the opening day of London fashion week by my colleague Hannah Marriott , who reports that the coronavirus outbreak has dealt a blow to the numbers in attendance . 
The majority of press and buyers from China , which is responsible for a third of global luxury sales , are not at the five day event , she reports . 
The British Fashion Council ’s chief executive , Caroline Rush , has announced that heightened hygiene measures are in place at the central London venue on the Strand , with a " deep clean " each night and antibacterial hand sanitisers handed out .
