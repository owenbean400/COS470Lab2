Authorities in Slovakia say they hope a nationwide programme in which two thirds of the country ’s population were tested for Covid 19 in just two days last weekend will halve the number of cases of the virus in the country . 
The Slovak testing programme has drawn interest from across Europe , as debates continue about whether or not blanket testing is the best way to fight coronavirus . 
A Downing Street team travelled to Slovakia last weekend to witness the testing , keen to draw lessons before a mass testing programme due to be launched in Liverpool this weekend . 
Slovak officials said the team included two Downing Street advisers and two people responsible for arranging the UK ’s large scale testing programme in Liverpool . 
" They are interested in our lessons and in the details and results , " said Slovakia ’s deputy defence minister , Marian Majer , who added that Slovakia has offered to send a planning team to London to help with UK preparations if required . 
A No 10 spokesperson declined to comment on the visit except to say that " we are constantly seeking to evolve our testing system in order to control the spread of the virus and bring the R rate down " .
