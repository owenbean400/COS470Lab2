Premier League clubs can welcome back spectators in highly limited numbers next month for the first time since March , following an announcement by the British government . 
Up to 4,000 people can return to outdoor sports stadiums in parts of England classified as at low risk from coronavirus from 2 December , permitting the resumption of attendance at football , rugby and racecourses among other sports . 
The crowd ceiling will be set at 4,000 or half the stadium capacity , whichever is lower , in the lowest risk tier 1 parts of the country once a stricter lockdown due to the pandemic ends . 
In tier 2 areas , the limit will be 2,000 outdoors , or half the capacity , it said . 
In the highest tier 3 regions where Covid 19 remains acute , no spectators will be allowed . 
A few pilot events have been held with spectators , such as a cricket match at The Oval , while Brighton hosted Chelsea before this season ’s Premier League got underway . 
However , England ’s football and rugby leagues , and horse racing venues , have not allowed spectators since the first lockdown began in March . 
Rugby and racing were among the sports to receive financial aid from the government last week . 
Sports facing financial losses as a result of the absence of fans from stadiums can access a £ 300m winter survival package of loans and grants . 
The government said it would spell out which regions of England will sit in which tier on Thursday , based on the latest weekly Covid data . 
Before the current lockdown , most of the country including London was in tier 2 . 
But three of the biggest Premier League clubs – Liverpool , Manchester United and Manchester City – are located in what were previously the highest tier 3 areas , so it remains to be seen whether they will be allowed to admit fans after 2 December . 
The government said that where spectators are allowed , only home fans will be permitted , to prevent unnecessary travel on public transport by opposing fans .
