Some 25,000 jobs could be under threat at London ’s Heathrow Airport , its chief executive has warned , as new quarantine measures for international arrivals come into force . 
Passengers arriving in the UK from Monday will need to self isolate for 14 days under the latest government measure to reduce the spread of coronavirus . 
There has been widespread concern that this will cause huge damage to the travel and aviation sectors as they recover from pandemic . 
Speaking to the City AM podcast , The City View , Heathrow boss John Holland Kaye said he was now having to consider job cuts at the west London airport . 
" 76,000 people are employed at Heathrow , " he said . 
" That represents one in four households in the local community , so if we start cutting jobs on mass that has a devastating impact on local communities , including the Prime Minister ’s own constituency , which is only a few miles from the airport . 
" What we ’ve heard already from the airlines is that they are cutting around a third of all employees , so that would be 25,000 people out of work . 
That would be a devastating blow to west London and the Thames Valley . "
