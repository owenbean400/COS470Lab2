Italy ’s city centres were flooded with shoppers this weekend as the government considered which restrictions to enforce over the Christmas break . 
In Rome , police were forced to close off popular sites such including the Trevi fountain amid concerns about a possible spike in infections in January . 
The country overtook the UK as the European nation with the highest death toll with a total of 64,520 fatalities on Saturday . 
Almost 1 in 30 Italians have been infected since February . 
" All the main information websites today are full of pictures of city centres awash with unacceptable large gatherings , " Domenico Arcuri , Italy ’s special commissioner for the healthcare emergency , said . 
" We do not want to see those again ... we must avoid the third wave at all costs . 
It would be really complicated to launch the vaccination campaign amid a resurgence in cases . " 
Arcuri said Italy hoped to kick off the campaign between 12 and 15 January . 
At an emergency meeting on Sunday , the government discussed whether to ease a ban that currently prevents people from leaving their hometown on Christmas day , allowing an exception for small towns . 
Vincenzo De Luca , governor of Naples ’ badly hit Campania region , said he would fight such a step , saying : " If the government allows free movement of people for towns with less than 5,000 inhabitants we ’ll need to open a ward for democratic madness at the prime minister ’s residence . "
