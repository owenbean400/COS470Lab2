Schools in Greenwich , south east London , have been asked to close from Monday evening after " exponential growth " of coronavirus demanded " immediate action " , the council said , amid reports that the capital is likely to enter tier 3 soon . 
Council leader Danny Thorpe said : " I ’m writing this open letter to let you know the situation in Greenwich in relation to Covid 19 is now escalating extremely quickly and I have today been briefed by colleagues from Public Health England that the pandemic in Greenwich is now showing signs that we are in a period of exponential growth that demands immediate action . " 
He added that Greenwich now has the highest rates of infection at any time since March . 
Schools have been told to move to online learning for the rest of the term , with the exception of key worker children and those with specific needs . 
Writing to headteachers , Thorpe described the issue as " honestly one of the most difficult questions I have wrestled with during all my time as leader " . 
He added : " The DFE ( Department for Education ) are clear this is not their position and indeed have issued directives to some schools . 
However , I cannot in all good conscience stand by whilst the numbers are doubling so quickly . " 
It comes amid growing reports that the capital is likely to be moved into tier 3 measures soon , with a PA analysis finding that the London borough of Havering now has the fifth highest rate of new Covid 19 cases in England . 
A total of 1,314 new cases were recorded in Havering in the seven days to 9 December – a sharp increase from 834 new cases in the previous seven days . 
Five other London boroughs are also in the top 25 highest rates in England : Redbridge , Waltham Forest , Barking & amp ; 
Dagenham , Enfield and Newham . 
Rates are currently rising in all 32 London boroughs .
