The second wave of the Covid 19 pandemic in the UK is bringing a new tide of homelessness to a small square outside Charing Cross police station in London . 
" There ’s a lot of new faces , " said Jas Bhogal , a volunteer , while he handed out free gloves , hats and masks to a long queue of rough sleepers as temperatures dropped last week . 
" Employees that worked in the hospitality businesses , those that did not get furloughed , ended up on the street and came to use this service , " he said . 
The demand is so high that three other charity food drops are operating at the same time as Bhogal ’s Sikh Welfare and Awareness Team .
