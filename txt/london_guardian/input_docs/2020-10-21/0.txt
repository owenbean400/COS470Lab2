The UK finance minister will tell MPs tomorrow that prospects for the economy are getting bleaker as more and more of the country faces tougher restrictions to combat the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Rishi Sunak is expected to announce his fourth package of support for business in as many months amid mounting pressure on the government to help hard hit companies in lockdown affected regions . 
He has been looking at a number of options for providing further help after becoming increasingly downbeat about the prospects for jobs in the months ahead . 
Ministers are particularly concerned about the hospitality industry in London , which accounts for almost a quarter of the UK economy and is currently in tier 2 , but will not want to be seen as favouring the capital at a time when north south feelings in England are running high . 
Calls for Sunak to bolster his support have intensified , despite official figures showing that the UK borrowed more in the first six months of the current financial year than it did in the worst year of the banking crisis of the late 2000s .
