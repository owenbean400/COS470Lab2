Virgin Atlantic is preparing to cut more than 1,000 jobs after seeing a slower than expected recovery in international demand for air travel , Sky News has reported . 
The report comes as the company ’s £ 1.2bn ( $ 1.59bn ) rescue deal is set for completion this week after a London judge gave the go ahead to the airline ’s restructuring plan in a court hearing on Wednesday . 
The airline will announce the layoffs as soon as Friday , the report said , adding that the latest round of cuts , if confirmed , would mean that Virgin Atlantic ’s workforce has almost halved from about 10,000 people before the coronavirus pandemic . 
Virgin Atlantic declined to comment on the Sky News report . 
The company , which is 51 % owned by Richard Branson ’s Virgin Group and 49 % by US ’s Delta Air Lines , has had to close its Gatwick base and cut more than 3,500 jobs to contend with the fallout from the pandemic , which has grounded planes and hammered demand for air travel .
