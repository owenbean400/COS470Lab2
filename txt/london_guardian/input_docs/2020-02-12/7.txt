A mental health centre in Hove is going through a deep clean after a patient with flu like symptoms had to be treated . 
It â€™s understood the female patient had recently returned from Hong Kong , which Public Health England say is on the coronavirus warning list . 
The woman was treated at the unit , the Haven Annexe at Mill View hospital , and is believed to have since left the centre .
