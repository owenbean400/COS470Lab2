Dr Tedros has defended the reaction of the Chinese authorities to the outbreak . 
We were in this board room for a board meeting and almost all members states were praising China for what it did . 
And they had a reason ... 
China took action massively at the epicentre , at the source of the outbreak , in shutting down Wuhan city . 
And that helped prevent cases from being exported to other provinces in China and the rest of the world . 
And I remember a board member from the UK saying , verbatim , ‘ this is heroic ’ . 
Because when you shut down a city like that it has consequences – economic and so on – serious consequences .
