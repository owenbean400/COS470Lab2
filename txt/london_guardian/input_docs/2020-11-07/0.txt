The Queen has worn a face mask in public for the first time as she made a poignant pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior to mark the centenary of his burial on Wednesday , PA Media reports . 
Following government regulations , the head of state adopted the covering when she visited the place of worship for a brief ceremony - her first public engagement in London since March . 
A royal aide described the service as " deeply personal " for the monarch , who was married at the Abbey in November 1947 , and in tribute to the symbolic serviceman she left flowers , based on her wedding bouquet , at his final resting place . 
Members of the royal family from the Prince of Wales to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have appeared at official events wearing face coverings for the past few months , and the Queen has now followed suit .
