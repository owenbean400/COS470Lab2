The Church of England could suspend the sharing of chalices during communion because of coronavirus . 
The church is " monitoring the situation closely and taking advice from the relevant medical authorities " , James Newcome , bishop of Carlisle , told the C of E â€™s ruling body , the general synod , meeting in London . 
He reminded the synod that during the 2009 swine flu pandemic , the church advised clergy to suspend chalice sharing and urged churches to post notices about hygiene . 
" If the situation continues to get worse , that sort of [ advice ] will certainly be issued , " he said . 
The Catholic church in England and Wales has issued guidance to priests which includes asking people with cold and flu symptoms to refrain from taking communion from the chalice and for all members of congregations to use hand sanitisers . 
But it stopped short of suggesting the chalice to be withdrawn , or the sign of peace - when church goers shake hands - to be suspended as happened in 2009 .
