Mayor of Greater Manchester , Andy Burnham , said it would be the " worst of all possible worlds " to let some parts of the UK come out of lockdown at different times . 
Speaking to the BBC ’s Newsnight programme , Burnham said : " The suggestion I ’ve heard , and I really do not like the sound of it , is this idea it might be phased on a regional basis . 
" So lifted in London first , and possibly then possibly in the Midlands . 
All that I can tell you is it would be impossible to sustain here if there were images of people going back to pubs in other parts of the country . 
" It ’s got to be the same thing for the whole of the country . " 
He added : " A phased release , I think , would be awful . 
The worst of all possible worlds and I hope the Government will resist that . "
