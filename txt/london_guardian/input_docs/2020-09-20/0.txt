With the days shortening and the prospect of a tighter local lockdown imminent , there was understandable dismay among residents and business owners in London on Saturday . 
Outside Blade Hairclubbing , on Frith Street , Soho , three hairdressers waited for clients who may never come . 
On a normal day , they might get 10 customers but only three were booked in . 
Until lockdown , the salon had a downstairs bar and customers were served drinks in crystal glasses . 
" But we ca not run the bar now , " said owner Julia Despot Olofsson . 
" We can only serve water . " 
The prospect of a further lockdown could spell the end of the successful business . 
Its concept of " hairclubbing " – combining a party vibe with cutting hair – was so popular that on 19 March it was about to open a new salon in New York . 
" And then lockdown came , " Despot Olofsson said .
