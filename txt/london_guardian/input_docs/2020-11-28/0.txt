Update : Police have arrested 155 people for offences including breaching coronavirus regulations , assaulting a police officer and possession of drugs following anti lockdown protests in central London . 
The Metropolitan Police said it used early intervention methods to disperse the illegal gatherings , including intercepting coachloads of demonstrators as they came into the capital . 
Ch Supt Stuart Bell , policing commander for the event , said : On Friday , we made it very clear how we would police this event , warning those looking to attend that they risked facing enforcement action if they attended a gathering in London . 
Today â€™s enforcement action is a direct result of those individuals deliberately breaking the law and at times , targeting our officers with aggression and causing disruption to the road network . 
Our policing plan will continue well into the evening and I would urge anyone who has not already dispersed to go home .
