One of London â€™s biggest hospitals has warned that it is on track to become virtually Covid only amid a surge in cases in the capital that has left it scrambling to convert operating theatres , surgical recovery areas and stroke wards into intensive care units for the very sick . 
As the Covid case numbers in the UK continued an apparently inexorable rise , hitting 55,892 , with 23,813 in hospitals and 964 reported deaths , the chief executive of University College London Hospitals trust , Prof Marcel Levi , said admissions were already spiraling beyond the first wave in the spring . 
Every hospital in London was facing the same demands on beds and staff , and UCLH was taking admissions from other hospitals that were less well able to cope , he told the Guardian . 
" This is much more than we had in March and April , " said Levi , an acute medicine doctor . 
The 500 bed hospital has 220 Covid patients , with the numbers increasing by 5 % a day , but the real pressure is on intensive care where there are now 70 very sick patients , as there were in the spring , and rising fast . 
" Usually in our ITU we have about 35 patients so we are already doubled in size at UCLH . 
We are further surging upon the request of London to 92 patients in the next week , and thereafter probably we will have to grow even further , " he said . 
At UCLH , whole floors are having to be dismantled and rebuilt to the standards required for intensive care wards . 
As they did in March , they have had to convert five floors and equip them with oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) machines that help people breathe .
