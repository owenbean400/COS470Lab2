Saudi Arabia plans to resume tourist visas by early 2021 after months of suspension amid strict government measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus , the kingdom ’s tourism minister told Reuters . 
Tourism is a key pillar of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s reform strategy to reduce the economy ’s dependence on oil . 
The kingdom , which opened its doors to foreign tourists in September 2019 by launching a new visa regime for 49 countries , wants the sector to contribute 10 % of gross domestic product by 2030 . 
" For tourist visa , until now we are talking about early next year . 
If things get better or if any positive developments happen with regards to the vaccine , we might accelerate and have it earlier , " Ahmed al Khateeb said in a virtual interview . 
In late February the kingdom closed its borders to foreign pilgrims and to tourists from at least 25 countries . 
In March , it barred all travel in and out of the country . 
Khateeb said the tourism sector has been hit hard and is expected to see a 35%-45 % decline by year end . 
The focus on domestic tourism during the summer has cushioned the blow , however . 
This pandemic is a systematic risk that has hit everyone ; however , we have seen a very strong summer after the January May lockup period . 
We have noticed a growth of 30 % year on year in domestic tourism which is beyond our expectations . 
The Saudi Summer campaign , which promoted 10 tourist destinations – from beaches and forests to mountain peaks and historic areas – for citizens and residents to visit in lieu of holidaying abroad , helped boost average occupancy ratio at hotels to 80 % . 
Saudi Arabia has reported 332,790 Covid 19 cases and 4655 deaths so far . 
Infection rates have seen a steady decline over the past few weeks .
