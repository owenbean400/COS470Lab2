An update from London ’s Metropolitan Police on anti lockdown demonstrations that took place in central London today . 
The Met said 16 people were arrested " for a variety of offences including breaching coronavirus regulations , assaulting a police officer , public order offences and violent disorder . " 
Nine police officers were injured . 
Commander Ade Adelekan , who was in charge of policing the protest , said a failure by protest organisers to " engage with crowds and keep those assembling safe from transmitting the virus " had voided their risk assessment . 
Therefore , today ’s demonstration was no longer exempt from the coronavirus regulations . 
In the interest of public safety , officers then worked quickly to disperse crowds . 
Crowds have dispersed following demonstrations in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park . 
Sixteen arrests were made and frustratingly , nine officers were injured . 
Our update is below on the challenges officers faced . 
Our operation will continue into the night .
