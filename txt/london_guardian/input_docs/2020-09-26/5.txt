The Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin concluded a private visit to Mount Athos , a venerated male only centre of Orthodox Christianity in Greece where eight monks have tested positive for coronavirus , on Saturday , AFP reports . 
Commonly known as the Holy Mountain , Mount Athos is the spiritual capital of the Orthodox Christian world , consisting of 20 monasteries and about 700 houses , cells or hermitages housing approximately 1,700 monks . 
The Russian premier arrived Thursday in the male only preserve and stayed for two nights at the Filotheou monastery , the Athens News Agency reported . 
On Saturday morning , Mishustin visited the Panteleimon monastery where almost all monks are Russian . 
In 2016 , Russian president Vladimir Putin made a private visit to Mount Athos during a two day visit to Greece . 
Mishutsin donated a large amount of medical supplies including masks , disinfectants and other means of protection from Covid 19 . 
Eight monks have tested positive for coronavirus and their monastery in Mount Athos was quarantined on Monday . 
One of the monks has been taken to hospital in Thessaloniki in a serious condition . 
It is not the first outbreak on Mount Athos . 
Four monks tested positive in March after travelling to the UK but recovered quickly . 
The community , known for its austere rules , is almost completely isolated in a mountainous nature reserve in the Macedonia region . 
Greece â€™s lockdown from March to May hit the Church hard , wrecking its Easter celebrations . 
Church leaders disputed some of the science behind the confinement rules , agreeing to halt masses but refusing to ban communion . 
Greece has so far registered 376 deaths and more than 17,000 infections from the virus .
