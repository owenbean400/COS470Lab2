Britons stranded in New Zealand are facing costs of £ 40,000 to return home , my colleague Mark Townsend reported . 
Those stranded say they have been left without guidance or assistance after the UK embassy and consular services in New Zealand abruptly closed their doors last week . 
Flight prices to return to the UK have hiked , with one Qatari Airlines flight from Auckland to London on 31 March priced at NZ$83,534 ( £ 40,096 ) .
