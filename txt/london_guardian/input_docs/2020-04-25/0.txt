Prof Stephen Powis says the number of new cases diagnosed by testing is reasonably stable . 
With the number of tests expanding , we can expect to see a rise in new cases , but it is fairly stable for now . 
There is a sustained reduction in the number of people being treated in hospitals , particularly in London and beginning in other parts of the country , he says . 
He says the number of patients in critical care is starting to decline , although that will lag behind the overall number of admissions to hospitals . 
A new line for Northern Ireland has been introduced , showing new data that is not currently comparable with the other data as it is cumulative rather than daily , he adds . 
The number of deaths is showing a trend towards a decline , which will occur later than the trend in hospital admissions and critical care . 
If we continue to adhere to physical distancing we will begin to see a decline in deaths , he says .
