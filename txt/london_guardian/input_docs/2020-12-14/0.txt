A restaurant owner said he and his employees will be " left in the lurch " as a consequence of London moving to tougher tier 3 coronavirus restrictions . 
Andy Jones , who owns Jones & amp ; 
Sons restaurant , said he will lose hundreds of bookings , and a week ’s worth of food will be " wasted " , as London moves into tougher Covid 19 restrictions on Wednesday . 
" This week , we had about £ 42,000 worth of bookings in the system already , " he told the PA news agency . 
It ’s a big restaurant , and when you ’re stripping away that sort of money from people ’s cash flow , when you take away the livelihoods of staff who have just joined me ... there ’s just a whole group of people left in the lurch . " 
According to tier 3 rules , which will apply in England ’s capital as well as parts of Essex and Hertfordshire , hospitality venues must close , except for takeaway and delivery .
