The Sushi fast food chain , YO ! 
Sushi , has revealed that 54 of its restaurants will permanently close at the end of service on Wednesday . 
In an email sent to employees seen by the Guardian , the company said that the decision had come " in light of the escalating uncertainty of Covid 19 " and followed " some very difficult decisions " . 
" Regrettably , we have had to take this action as it is clearly in the interests of public health to do so and there is nothing more important than that , in particular our responsibilities to the elderly and vulnerable , " the email said . 
It currently unclear which restaurants will be included , but at least one branch in London is set to shut . 
One employee , who wished to remain anonymous , said : " This is a lot to come to terms with . 
A week ago we were all talking about the future and what we can do with the restaurant , now we ’re shut . 
It ’s so much to process in such a short space of time . " 
YO ! 
Sushi has almost 100 restaurants operating across 8 countries , 70 of which are located in the UK .
