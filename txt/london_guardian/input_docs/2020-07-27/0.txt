A trade association representing British airports called on the government to drop the need for holidaymakers to quarantine for two weeks after returning from Spain ’s Balearic and Canary Islands , warning of a further hit to the beleaguered sector . 
A total of 15 % of flights leaving Britain in August last year were destined for the islands , carrying just under 2.4 million people , the Airport Operators Association ( AOA ) said on Monday . 
AOA chief executive Karen Dee said : The government must look urgently at introducing air bridges on a regional basis which would allow travel to islands such as Lanzarote , Majorca and Tenerife , where infection rates are lower , to continue . 
UK airports have already lost around £ 2bn ( $ 2.6bn ) since the start of the pandemic and this announcement reinforces the fragile nature of the industry . 
Last year , Britons made up over a fifth of foreign visitors to Spain , which relies heavily on tourism revenues , and the government there has said it is focussing its efforts on trying to persuade London to exclude the islands from its quarantine plans . 
Britain has defended the decision as a response to a rise in infections .
