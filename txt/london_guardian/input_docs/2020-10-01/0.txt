A lawmaker from Nicola Sturgeon ’s ruling Scottish National Party ( SNP ) has been suspended after travelling home by train from London to Scotland , despite having received a positive test result for Covid 19 . 
Margaret Ferrier was told her test was positive on Monday after she had spoken in Britain ’s parliament at Westminster . 
She said in a statement : On Monday evening I received a positive test result for Covid 19 . 
I travelled home by train on Tuesday morning without seeking advice . 
This was ... wrong and I am sorry . 
The SNP ’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said on Twitter he was suspending her , and that Ferrier would refer herself to the police . 
I have spoken with @ Margaret Ferrier this evening who fully accepts that what she did was wrong . 
Margaret will be referring herself to the parliamentary standards commissioner as well as the police . 
I am tonight suspending the whip from Margaret . 
It is mandatory in England for people to self isolate if they test positive for the coronavirus , with fines of £ 1,000 for those who breach the rules . 
The opposition Labour party ’s Scotland spokesman had earlier said the SNP should condemn Ferrier and discipline her . 
" It ca not be one rule for Margaret Ferrier , and one rule for everyone else , " Ian Murray said on Twitter .
