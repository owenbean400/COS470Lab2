The first minister of Scotland , Nicola Sturgeon , has described the actions of an MP who took a train from London to Scotland knowing she had tested positive for Covid 19 as " utterly indefensible " . 
Margaret Ferrier , the SNP MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West , apologised unreservedly for two major breaches of Covid regulations . 
Taking to Twitter , Sturgeon said . 
It ’s hard to express just how angry I feel on behalf of people across the country making hard sacrifices every day to help beat COVID . 
The rules apply to everyone and they ’re in place to keep people safe .
