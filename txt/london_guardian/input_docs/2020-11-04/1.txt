Londoners appear to have shrugged off the UK ’s resurgent Covid 19 pandemic as they flocked to pubs and restaurants on Wednesday night , hours before the introduction of a new month long lockdown across England . 
While the UK ’s death toll from the coronavirus rose on Wednesday by 492 , the most since mid May , Soho was teeming with revellers seeking one last night out before lockdown . 
People will be ordered to stay at home from 00:01 GMT on Thursday to combat a surge in new infections that scientists say could , if unchecked , cause more deaths than a first wave that forced a three month lockdown earlier this year . 
The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe from Covid 19 and is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day . 
Scientists warned the " worst case " scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded without action . 
Even before Wednesday , data from restaurant bookings service Open Table showed a surge in demand for London eateries during the run up to the new lockdown . 
Several English police forces used social media to urge people going out on Wednesday night to follow social distancing rules . 
Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland have their own lockdown policies and enacted tougher restrictions last month .
