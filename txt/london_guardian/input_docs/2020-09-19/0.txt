Police in London made 32 arrests at an anti lockdown demonstration in the centre of the city on Saturday . 
According to a statement from the Metropolitan police , people were arrested for offences including violent disorder , public order and assault on an emergency worker , as well under Covid Regulations . 
Two police officers suffered minor injuries , police said . 
The Guardian witnessed police launched a surprise attack on the protest just after 4pm . 
Without warning police officers charged into Trafalgar Square , where the protest was taking place , in an apparent attempt to seize control of the stage . 
Protesters used metal fencing to block the path of charging police and there were fistfights between protesters and officers . 
Protesters on the scene were not warned ahead of the attack . 
About an hour beforehand police had released a statement online saying they were " encouraging " people to leave the protest and that those who remained could be arrested . 
Police said the protest was cleared shortly after 6pm . 
Superintendent Emma Richards , who was the Met ’s " gold commander " for the protest , claimed it was protesters who had shown hostility towards police . 
She said : " We remain in the middle of a public health crisis , and by gathering in large numbers – such as today ’s protest – puts others at risk . 
We advised those in attendance to leave but many refused to do so."The amount of hostility shown towards officers , who were simply there to keep people safe , is unacceptable . 
More than 30 people were arrested and they remain in custody."The area around Trafalgar Square has now been cleared allowing Londoners to continue with their Saturday evening , whilst adhering to government advice . "
