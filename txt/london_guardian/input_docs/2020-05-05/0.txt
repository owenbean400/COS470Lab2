The Church of England is to allow clergy back into churches on a highly limited basis as part of a three step plan to reopen its places of worship . 
The C of E ’s House of Bishops decided at a Zoom meeting on Tuesday that a phased lifting of restrictions would be implemented " in time and in parallel with the government ’s approach " . 
The first of the three steps is an immediate reopening of churches where local bishops agree , to allow clergy to stream services or to pray privately . 
The second phase will be access to churches for some rites and celebrations , such as funerals , " when allowed by law , observing appropriate physical distancing and hygiene precautions " . 
The final step will be the resumption of services with limited congregations " when government restrictions are eased to allow this " . 
Sarah Mullally , the bishop of London , said : While it is clear there will be no imminent return to normality , the emphasis is now turning towards how and when aspects of social distancing can be eased , although we remain mindful of the potential risks of a second wave of the virus . 
Nevertheless , it now makes sense for us to start to look ahead to the potential easing of restrictions so that our clergy and churches can be prepared .
