The Bank of England has cast doubt on the UK government drive to get workers back to offices , after a senior official warned it was impossible for large numbers of staff to return to central London and other big cities while risks from Covid 19 remained . 
Pouring cold water on the government campaign , Alex Brazier , the Bank ’s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk , said it was " not possible " for a mass return to city centre offices across Britain this autumn due to Covid guidelines , concerns over the health risks , and transport capacity issues . 
He said : With Covid safe guidelines , it ’s not possible to use office space – particularly in central London and dense places like that – with the intensity that we used to use it . 
So it ’s actually not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly .
