The UK government is planning to impose a lockdown across most of northern England and potentially London , to combat a second coronavirus wave , the Times reports . 
Under the new lockdown measures being considered , all pubs , restaurants and bars would be ordered to shut for two weeks initially , the report said . 
The report added that households would also be banned indefinitely from meeting each other in any indoor location . 
Britain had last week imposed new measures that required people to work from home where possible and had ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a fast spreading second wave of Covid 19 , with new restrictions lasting probably six months . 
Merseyside , the northeast and Lancashire may be included in the possible new measures alongside London , according to the newspaper . 
Schools and shops will be allowed to remain open , as will factories and offices at which staff could not work from home , the Times added , citing a senior government source .
