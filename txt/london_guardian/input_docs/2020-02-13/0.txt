We reported earlier that the latest patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK took an Uber to hospital in south London after developing symptoms . 
Commenting on the safety of the Uber driver who drove the woman , Dr Rachel Thorn Heathcock , consultant at Public Health England , said : We are in contact with Uber to ensure the driver receives advice and information on what to do should they feel unwell in the coming days . 
As the journey was less than 15 minutes , the driver did not have close sustained contact with the individual and are not considered high risk . 
We would like to thank Uber for their cooperation .
