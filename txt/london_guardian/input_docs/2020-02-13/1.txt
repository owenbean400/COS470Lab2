The alleged presence of coronavirus that led to the closure of a GP practice in north London was a false alarm , it is understood . 
Ritchie Street surgery in Islington blamed the virus for its decision to shut in a notice on its door . 
It said : " Practice is closed until 14/02/2020 due to the coronavirus . 
Any patients that have the symptoms should call 111 and not come to the practice . " 
However , no patients from or staff at the practice have tested positive for the virus , it has now emerged . 
It remains unclear why the surgery management took the decision to shut . 
NHS officials believe that the management may have done so as a precaution after testing a patient who suspected that they may have contracted the virus .
