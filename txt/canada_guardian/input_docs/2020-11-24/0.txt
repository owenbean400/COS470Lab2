Justin Trudeau , the prime minister of Canada , has said that the country will have to wait for a vaccine because the very first ones that roll off assembly lines are likely to be given to citizens of the country they are made in . 
Trudeau noted Canada does not have vaccine production facilities . 
The United States , the United Kingdom and Germany do . 
Trudeau said it is understandable that an American pharmaceutical company will distribute first in the U.S . before they distribute internationally . 
" Shortly afterwards they will start honoring and delivering the contracts that they signed with other countries including Canada , " Trudeau said , in remarks reported by AP . 
" We â€™re expecting to start receiving those doses in the first few months of 2021 . "
