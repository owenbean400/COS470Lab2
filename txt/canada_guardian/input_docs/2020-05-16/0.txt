Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday that his government had approved the first Canadian clinical trials of a potential Covid 19 vaccine , at Dalhousie University ’s Canadian Center for Vaccinology in Nova Scotia . 
The candidate vaccine was developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Can Sino Biologics , two Canadian government spokesmen said , according to Reuters . 
Canada ’s National Research Council on Tuesday said it was collaborating with Can Sino to " pave the way " for future Canadian trials . 
The council will work with manufacturers so that the vaccine can be produced in Canada if the trials are successful , Trudeau said . 
Trudeau also said he would look at possible ways to help airlines further , but laid out no new measures after the country ’s biggest airline announced mass layoffs due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
Air Canada said on Friday it would cut its workforce by up to 60 % as the airline tries to save cash amid the Covid 19 pandemic and adjust to a lower level of traffic .
