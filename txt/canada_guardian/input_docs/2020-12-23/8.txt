The Moderna company have said on Wednesday that it expects its vaccine to be protective against the new variant reported in the UK . 
Currently , there are plans to run tests to confirm the vaccine ’s activity against any strain . 
This comes as the UK government announced stricter lockdowns to huge parts of the country . 
In a statement from the Moderna company , they said : We have already tested sera from animals and humans vaccinated with the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine against a number of previous variants of the SARS Co V 2 virus that have emerged since the first outbreak of the pandemic and found our vaccine to remain equally effective . 
Based on the data to date , Moderna expects that the vaccine induced immunity from the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine would be protective against the variants of the SARS Co V 2 virus recently described in the UK . 
We will be performing additional tests of the vaccine in the coming weeks to confirm this expectation . 
We continue to test the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine against new SARS Co V 2 variants , and our expectation is that the vaccine ’s effectiveness will hold against them as well .
