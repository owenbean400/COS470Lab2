Justin Trudeau ’s government has announced ambitious plans to spend billions on childcare , housing and healthcare – partly financed by taxing " extreme wealth inequality " – as Canada braces for an economically devastating second wave of coronavirus . 
But opposition parties quickly dismissed the minority government ’s proposals , prompting speculation that Canada will soon head into another general election . 
The prime minister ’s speech from the throne – which customarily starts a new session of parliament and outlines a government ’s priorities – was delivered by governor general Julie Payette on Wednesday afternoon . 
The speech included calls for green investment and a plan to create more than a million new jobs , but was overshadowed by the pandemic which has killed 9,241 Canadians and left 2 million unemployed . 
" Like a reed in high winds , we may sway , but we will not break , " said Payette . 
She called Covid 19 " the most serious public health crisis Canada has ever faced " .
