The travel ban for international excursions for Western Australian schools has been extended due to the spread of coronavirus across the United States . 
WA Education Minister Sue Ellery said her decision to extend the ban was following advice from the Chief Health Officer . 
Due to its close proximity to the US border , Canada has also been included . 
All public , private and Catholic schools will be banned from travelling to those countries . 
New Zealand is the only country where international travel will be considered for WA school groups . 
" We have a duty of care to school students and staff , with the aim of reducing the possibility of exposure to the coronavirus while overseas , " Ms Ellery said .
