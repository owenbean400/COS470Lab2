Canada ’s statistical agency is paying close attention to the " pot of cash " that Canadians have saved up amid the Covid 19 pandemic as it looks to understand who is saving and how that money may contribute to the shape of the recovery . 
Prior to the pandemic , Canadians saved just 2-3 % of their disposable income , but that jumped to 28.2 % in the second quarter of this year , Greg Peterson , assistant chief statistician at Statistics Canada , told Reuters on Monday . 
" There ’s that pot of cash that ’s basically sitting there and we ’re interested in monitoring where that goes , " Peterson said . 
" It ’s kind of a notable divergence from what we normally see . " 
One of the main questions is whether the extra money will go toward paying down household debt or whether it will be spent on goods and services , Peterson said . 
The economy is now showing signs of having put the worst behind it , and Canada ’s real GDP is seen rebounding 3 % in July , edging economic activity closer to pre pandemic levels , data showed last week . 
The jump in the savings rate came in the second quarter amid a unique set of circumstances : disposable incomes climbed sharply on higher government transfers - namely emergency wage benefits - while household spending fell amid Covid 19 shutdowns .
