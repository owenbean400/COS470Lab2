Walt Disney ’s live action version of Mulan will skip most of the world ’s movie theatres and go directly to its streaming platform in September , the media giant has said . 
The decision follows uncertainty about when big cinema chains in the US will be able to reopen after being shuttered since mid March because of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Mulan will cost a premium price of $ 29.99 on the Disney + streaming service in the United States , Canada , Australia and parts of Western Europe , Disney ’s chief executive , Bob Chapek , said . 
The movie , reported to have cost $ 200m to produce , will be released on 4 September in cinemas in areas that do not currently have the Disney + platform and where movie theatres are open , Chapek added . 
Mulan had been scheduled to reach cinemas in March , but its release has been postponed several times as many cinemas remain closed . 
Most recently , it was set to debut 21 August , and theatre operators had hoped it would help spark a late summer rebound for movie going .
