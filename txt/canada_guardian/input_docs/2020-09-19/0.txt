Ontario is scrambling to tamp down a recent spike in coronavirus cases as children return to school and the province struggles to increase its testing capacity , forcing many in cities to wait in line for hours this week to get swabbed , Reuters reports . 
Private parties are a " significant contributor " to the recent rise , provincial health minister Christine Elliott said . 
" Folks , we ca not have these wild parties right now . 
It ’s just way , way too risky , " Ford said in a nationally broadcast news conference . 
" We have to come down hard on the rule breakers . "
