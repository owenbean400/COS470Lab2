Canada ’s most populous province has announced new restrictions and steep fines amid a surge of Covid 19 infections that has prompted concerns the country is losing control of the virus . 
Ontario premier Doug Ford on Thursday announced plans to limit the size of gatherings , reversing course on previous steps to reopen the province ’s economy . 
The new rules reduce the size of indoor gatherings to 10 , down from 50 , and outdoor gatherings to 25 , down from 100 . 
Of the coronavirus flare ups in the cities of Ottawa , Peel and Toronto , Ford said : This is a serious situation , folks . 
We will throw the book at you if you break the rules . 
This crisis is far from over . 
The province is implementing a C$10,000 fine for organisers of " illegal " gatherings . 
The move suggests a second wave of the virus is looming , after the province effectively slowed growth over the summer .
