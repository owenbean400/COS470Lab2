Health officials in Ontario said two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus variant first detected in the UK have appeared in the Canadian province . 
The cases , identified in a couple in southern Ontario with no known travel history , exposure or high risk contact , came as the province went into a lockdown on Saturday . 
" This further reinforces the need for Ontarians to stay home as much as possible and continue to follow all public health advice , including the provincewide shutdown measures beginning today , " Dr . Barbara Yaffe , Ontario â€™s associate chief medical officer , said in a statement . 
Last week , Canada extended to January 6 a ban on passenger flights arriving from Britain and expanded enhanced screening and monitoring measures to travelers arriving from South Africa , citing the rise of the more infectious variant .
