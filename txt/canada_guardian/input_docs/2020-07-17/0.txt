A top medical official has linked a recent spike in coronavirus cases in Canada to groups of young people gathering in bars , nightclubs and parties . 
Deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo said during a briefing : When we examine recent trends in case reporting , there is some cause for concern . 
After a period of steady decline , daily case counts have started to rise . " 
Njoo said the daily case count had risen to an average of 350 over the last week up from 300 a day earlier in July . 
More than 430 cases were reported on Thursday . 
This coincides with increasing reports of individuals contracting COVID 19 at parties , nightclubs and bars as well as increasing rates of transmission among young Canadians . " 
Canada has reported 109,266 total cases and 8,827 deaths , far fewer than in the United States . 
Officials and experts this week said they saw signs of a new spike as the 10 provinces lifted social and economic restrictions imposed in March to fight the outbreak .
