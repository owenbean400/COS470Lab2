Canada will require air travellers aged five and above to test negative for Covid 19 before arrival , starting 7 January , transport minister Marc Garneau said , as the country tightens travel restrictions amid soaring coronavirus cases . 
Passengers will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) Covid 19 test taken within 72 hours prior to their scheduled departure to Canada , after social media images of unmasked Canadian tourists abroad prompted calls for stricter measures to curb the virus . 
Documentation showing a negative result must be shown to the airline before boarding a flight to Canada , Garneau said . 
Pre departure testing will not eliminate a mandatory 14 day quarantine for arrivals , in a blow to Canada ’s airlines which had been pushing for a negative result to be accepted as an alternative to such restrictions . 
" The announcement only addresses one element of the path forward : the utilisation of testing to help further protect public health , " said Mike Mc Naney , president of National Airlines Council of Canada , which represents large carriers such as Air Canada . 
" We strongly believe it must also be utilised in conjunction with measures to reduce quarantine levels , " he said . 
The new measures add to Canada ’s existing restrictions , which deny non essential foreigners entry and where citizens returning from abroad are required to quarantine . 
Canada would also increase surveillance to ensure travellers entering Canada complete their quarantine , Garneau said . 
Canada reported on Thursday a total of 572,982 cases of Covid 19 , as new cases surged in its most populous provinces , Ontario and Quebec . 
On Tuesday , Quebec urged the federal government to require Covid 19 testing for residents returning from year end vacations , as hospitals wrestle with growing cases in the province .
