My colleague Leylan Cecco reports that Canada ’s most populous province will shut down schools for two weeks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus . 
All publicly funded schools in Ontario will be shut down from March 14 until April 5 , 2020 . 
" We recognize the significant impact this decision will have on families , students , schools , as well as the broader community , but this precaution is necessary to keep people safe , " the province said in a statement this afternoon , the day before schools closed for a one week spring break . 
The advice to shutter all schools came from Ontario ’s chief medical officer , Dr . David Williams , who also called on people to refrain from attending large events in the coming days . 
The surprise decision follows remarks from premier Doug Ford earlier today that appeared out of step with the cautious messaging from neighbouring provinces . 
" I just want the families and their children to have a good time . 
Go away , have a good time , enjoy yourself , " he told reporters Thursday . 
" We ’re going to be monitoring the situation as it changes every single day . " 
Ontario now has 59 cases of the coronavirus .
