Quebec , Canada ’s hardest hit province from the coronavirus pandemic , said on Thursday it would crack down on bar crowding , following a recent outbreak at a suburban Montreal pub and reports of overcrowded nightclub floors . 
Its health minister Christian Dubé said the province would now require bars to stop selling alcohol at midnight . 
Closing time is moved up to 1 a.m . from 3 a.m . Nightclub dance floors must remain free of dancers and bars will only be allowed to admit half capacity , he said . 
The new requirements , which take effect on Friday , followed reports on social media of crowding in Montreal pubs after Quebec started easing restrictions last month . 
The province accounts for more than half of Canada*s 106,434 cases and 8,737 deaths from the virus .
