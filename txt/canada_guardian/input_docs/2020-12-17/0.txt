Coca Cola will cut 2,200 jobs globally , including 1,200 in the US , as the economic fallout from the Covid 19 pandemic forces the world ’s largest soda maker to accelerate its business restructuring . 
The company said in August it was offering voluntary separation packages to 4,000 workers in the US , Canada and Puerto Rico , as it looked to streamline itself while its sales were taking a hit from the health crisis . 
Coca Cola said on Thursday it will not disclose the number of employees who have accepted the package . 
It also did not give details about the timeline for the job cuts . 
The news of job cuts come as millions of Americans are already stuck on unemployment benefits as a relentless wave of new Covid 19 infections hobble business operations . 
" The pandemic was not a cause for these changes , but it has been a catalyst for the company to move faster , " Coca Cola said in a statement . 
It had about 86,200 employees at the end of last year , of which 10,400 were located in the US . 
About 500 job cuts will be in metro Atlanta , where Coca Cola ’s headquarter is based .
