Canadian children can go trick or treating on Halloween despite being in the middle of a second wave of Covid 19 , the country ’s top health officials say , as long as they practice physical distancing , wear masks and wash their hands . 
In Canada , as in the United States , Halloween brings armies of children dressed in spooky costumes out onto the streets in search of candy and maybe a fright or two . 
For parents , this year ’s Halloween is truly a scary prospect , however , as coronavirus case numbers climb . 
Canada recorded 975 new infections on Monday , and the prime minister warned last week that the country is at a " tipping point " in its battle against a second surge . 
" We can have Halloween ... 
It ’s possible to give and receive candy safely , " Dr Howard Njoo , Canada ’s deputy chief public health officer , told a news conference on Tuesday . 
" There are some really interesting ideas where people are handing out treats on the end of a hockey stick , " added Dr Theresa Tam , the chief medical officer . 
" Pre packaging your treats so people are not rummaging in a bowl of candies is actually important . " 
More tips , like equipping the kids with small bottles of hand sanitiser , will be posted on the health ministry ’s website , she said . 
Health experts agree it is important to have " some degree of normality " during the pandemic , Tam said , but added that staying outdoors , physical distancing and wearing masks that " could turn into part of your costume " are necessary .
