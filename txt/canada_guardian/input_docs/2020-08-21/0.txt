A plant capable of supplying 50 million N95 face masks a year will help stave off " terrifying " shortages during the coronavirus pandemic , the leader of Canada ’s most populous province said on Friday . 
Ottawa and the province of Ontario decided to invest C$23 million ( $ 17.5 million ) each to expand the facility after experiencing serious problems as they tried to stock up on foreign made personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for health care workers in the first weeks of the outbreak . 
" We were left in a terrible , terrible situation ... and the terrifying reality is , at one point back in April , Ontario was left with less one week ’s supply of N95 masks , " Premier Doug Ford told reporters . 
" I promised the people of Ontario that we would never , ever again be left at the mercy of other countries for this critical PPE , " Ford spoke at the plant in Brockville , a town about 110 km ( 70 miles ) south of Ottawa . 
Starting next year , 3M Co Canadian will produce 25 million masks for the federal government and another 25 million for Ontario . 
In April , Ford complained the US had blocked the export of more than 3 million face masks Ontario had bought . 
Canada has reported 123,873 total cases and 9,054 deaths . 
Ontario accounts for the 31 % of the death toll . 
Federal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the plant would help " ensure we have the capacity to make whatever we need , here in our own communities " and could one day export masks .
