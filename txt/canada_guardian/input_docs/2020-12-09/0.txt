For a man presenting landmark results from trials of a vaccine that it is hoped will save the world from a devastating pandemic , Sir Menelas Pangalos did not look cheerful on Wednesday . 
Pangalos , the executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&amp ; D at Astra Zeneca , and his colleagues are undoubtedly exhausted , having been working round the clock on the coronavirus vaccine with Oxford University since April . 
But they are now dealing with a sizeable new headache – the doubts of the US regulator . 
It is clear that in spite of the critical need for coronavirus vaccines , the Food and Drug Administration is not going to rush to approve this vaccine developed by Oxford University and Astra Zeneca , even though the US , through its " Operation Warp Speed " , has put in substantial funding and ordered 300m doses . 
Unlike Pfizer/Bio NTech and Moderna ’s m RNA products , the Astra Zeneca vaccine is cheap , it can be stored at ordinary fridge temperatures , is easy to manufacture and presents the best hope at the moment for a vaccine for the billions rather than the few . 
But while the UK , the rest of Europe , and Canada and India could approve this vaccine in the coming weeks , the US , which has the world ’s biggest epidemic , will have to wait .
