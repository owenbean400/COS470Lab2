At a primary school in the Canadian province of Quebec , nine children have tested positive for Covid 19 out of a class of 11 , health officials said . 
The class was small because the school has been operating at half capacity . 
Health officials confirm the school in Trois Rivières had taken preventative measures , such as handwashing reminders and marking spaces on the floor to encourage social distancing . 
Primary schools opened across Quebec outside the city of Montreal on 11 May , despite the province being Canada ’s biggest coronavirus hotspot , with 52,398 total cases and 4,935 deaths currently recorded . 
Ontario , the site of Canada ’s second largest hotspot , has closed schools for the remainder of the school year .
