Canada ’s oil producing province of Alberta , hard hit by lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic , is counting on National Hockey League ( NHL ) games to provide a badly needed boost to morale and business , Reuters reports . 
Edmonton , the provincial capital and home to the NHL ’s Edmonton Oilers , will be a hub city with Toronto when games resume on 1 August , the first since the league suspended the season in March . 
Each city will host 12 teams , sequestering players in so called bubbles that encompass arenas , hotels and select restaurants . 
Fans will not attend the games . 
The spread of coronavirus has eased in Canada , allowing the two cities to beat out rivals such as Las Vegas , which has seen increased infections , for the chance to host the games . 
Alberta premier Jason Kenney said hosting games could generate C$60m ( $ 44.16m ) in economic activity . 
" That alone is not going to turn around our economy , but it ’s a great shot in the arm , " he said . 
Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs officials abruptly postponed news conferences on Saturday to discuss the hub cities , citing incomplete talks between the Canadian government and the league . 
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman told reporters the league needed to finalise " a couple of details " with Ottawa . 
Alberta ’s unemployment rate was the second highest in Canada in June as a crash in oil prices this spring forced energy companies to lay off workers and some businesses remained closed due to the pandemic . 
Alberta ’s chief medical officer has reassured the public that arriving hockey players will not accelerate the spread of the virus if they abide by certain conditions , which include daily testing and restricted movement .
