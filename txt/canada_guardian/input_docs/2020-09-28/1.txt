Ontario has set a new record for daily coronavirus cases , as the province officially entered its second wave of Covid 19 and officials warned that it will be " worse than the first " . 
Ontario logged 700 new Covid 19 infections on Monday – well above the previous highest daily total of 640 on 24 April – as the province ’s premier , Doug Ford , warned residents to expect a " more complex " and " more complicated " surge of the virus in the coming weeks . 
" We know it will be worse than the first wave , but we do not know how bad the second wave will be , " said Ford . 
" Our collective actions will determine if we face a wave or a tsunami . " 
Ford called Monday ’s numbers in Canada ’s most populous province " deeply concerning " and pleaded for residents to download the country ’s Covid 19 alert application . 
New modelling from health officials suggests the province will hit a peak around mid October , with new cases likely to exceed 1,000 a day , unless drastic action is taken by local and provincial governments .
