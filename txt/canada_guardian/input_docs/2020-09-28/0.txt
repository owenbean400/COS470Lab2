Quebec , the hardest hit Canadian province , has reported another sharp increase in daily infections , amid media reports that its premier , François Legault , would announce new restrictions for Montreal and the capital , Quebec City . 
Quebec added 750 new cases on Monday despite existing restrictions on mask wearing and social gatherings put in place by Canada ’s second most populous province to contain the spread of infections . 
The health minister , Christian Dubé , told a French language talk show on Sunday night the two cities were close to being listed as red zones , referring to the province ’s traffic light system for designating transmission , with red being the hardest hit .
