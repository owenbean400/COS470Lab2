Air Canada ’s chief executive officer , Calin Rovinescu , has urged the Canadian government to relax travel restrictions as they have been hurting the company ’s sales , Bloomberg News reported . 
Rovinescu called the government ’s curbs on travelers " disproportionate " as the COVID 19 pandemic was easing in many parts of the country . 
" Enable us to do some reasonable amounts of business , " he said , according to the report , while speaking on a webcast with publishing and event production company Aviation Week . 
Rovinescu ’s remarks were in the context of a letter sent to prime minister , Justin Trudeau , from the Canadian travel and tourism industry , calling for a national plan to cut back pandemic travel restrictions , Air Canada said . 
Canada and the United States are set to extend a ban on non essential travel to late July as both countries seek to control the spread of the new coronavirus , Reuters reported on Tuesday . 
Airlines , including Air Canada , have been among the worst hit as coronavirus led travel bans resulted in thousands of flight cancellations , forcing carriers to cut jobs and costs as revenue dried up .
