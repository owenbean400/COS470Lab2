The Canadian government and the province of Alberta are launching a pilot programme to test eligible returning travellers for Covid 19 , allowing them to leave quarantine once they receive a negative result , Alberta premier Jason Kenney said . 
The move could potentially bring relief to the country ’s struggling airline and tourism industries , which have lobbied the federal government to ease travel restrictions and a strict 14 day quarantine rule . 
Canadian citizens , permanent residents , foreign nationals allowed entry into Canada and essential workers with no symptoms can volunteer to get tested at the Calgary International Airport and one land border crossing starting on 2 November . 
Such passengers can then leave quarantine once they receive a negative result , as long as they commit to getting a second test six or seven days after their arrival , participating in daily check ins and following other public health measures . 
Canada has had a mandatory quarantine for all travellers entering the country since March . 
" Covid 19 is still here but we ’ve come a long way since March , " Kenney said . 
" We must find ways to bring back safe travel if we ’re ever going to get the economy firing again on all cylinders . " 
He called the pilot programme " a sign of hope " for the travel industries . 
West Jet Airlines , Canada ’s number two airline , welcomed the announcement . 
" We have been asking for a science based approach based on multiple layers of testing to help safely ease the quarantine requirements , " said Ed Sims , West Jet president and chief executive . 
The EU this week removed Canadians from their list of " safe " travellers as Covid 19 cases rose across the country .
