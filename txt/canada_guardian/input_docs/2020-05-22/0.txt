Australia , Canada and the United Kingdom have issued a joint statement expressing deep concern at proposals from China for introducing legislation related to national security in Hong Kong that will impinge on civil liberties . 
" Making such a law on Hong Kong ’s behalf without the direct participation of its people , legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the ‘ one country , two systems ’ principle under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy , " the statement says .
