There are claims this evening that the UK prime minister ’s decision to stop just short of ordering businesses such as pubs , restaurants and theatres to close down altogether will make it harder for them to claim back losses on their insurance . 
The shadow digital , culture and media secretary , Tracy Brabin , has said : It is a tragedy for any arts venue when they have no choice but to close . 
From the West End to community theatres up and down the country , many artists , actors , stage crew , producers and other workers face a terrible time ahead . 
It ’s unacceptable that the Tories seem to be prioritising the needs of the insurance industry in what could be an existential crisis for our sector . 
The prime minister must urgently clarify that theatres , music venues , and other organisations in the creative industries affected by his statement can claim insurance . 
The same goes for the UK ’s incredible hospitality sector . 
These industries are part of the lifeblood of the nation and Labour will fight for their future .
