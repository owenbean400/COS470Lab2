Zimbabwe ’s defence minister has described the coronavirus as God ’s way of punishing the United States and other western countries for imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe , prompting the president to issue a statement Monday restating his governments commitment to fighting Covid 19 . 
Oppah Muchinguri , the defense minister , appeared to mock Western nations while addressing a group of ruling party supporters at the weekend."This coronavirus that has come are sanctions against the countries that have imposed sanctions on us . 
God is punishing them now and they are staying indoors now while their economy is screaming like what they did to ours by imposing sanctions on us , " Muchinguri said at a rally in Chinhoyi , about 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) northwest of the capital , Harare , according to local reports . 
A video of her statement has gone viral." ( Donald ) Trump should know that he is not God . 
They must face the consequences of coronavirus so that they also feel the pain , " she said in the local Shona language . 
Muchinguri ’s utterances prompted massive criticism from opposition politicians , humanitarian organizations and ordinary Zimbabweans on social media . 
Zimbabwe has not yet recorded a case of coronavirus but neighboring South Africa has more than 60 cases . 
Across Africa , 30 of the continent ’s 54 countries have confirmed cases . 
President Emmerson Mnangagwa issued a statement Monday saying his government empathises with the affected people around the globe . 
He did not mention Muchinguri by name , but the statement published in the state run Herald newspaper appears to modify her criticism of the US .
