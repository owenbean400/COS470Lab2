The Australian stockmarket has risen more than 1.6 % at the opening bell , defying the strong lead set by a crash overnight in the US . 
The ASX is still down by about 30 % since the coronavirus crisis started hitting markets about a month ago , and the extreme volatility we ’ve seen in recent days means there ’s no guarantee the relief will last . 
Australian companies rushed out waves of bad news before the market opened , with flagship carrier Qantas saying it would cut international flights by 90 % and domestic ones by 60 % . 
The move , which will ground about 150 aircraft including almost all the airline ’s long haul fleet , is the latest reaction in an industry put under extreme financial pressure by the coronavirus crisis . 
The Australian government has not ruled out a bail out for the industry . 
Elsewhere , soft drink manufacturer Coca Cola Amatil canned its profit forecasts , Auckland Airport cancelled its dividend , property developer Sunland called off a AUD$60m ( £ 29.43m ) share buyback program and Crown Resorts extended the closure of every second poker machine to its Burswood casino .
