Ten Britons and a UK resident who had been stranded by the coronavirus lockdown in the Peruvian city of Cusco for more than a month have left Lima on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt after successfully being transferred from the Andean city to the capital . 
The group , which included UK citizens who had tested positive for Covid 19 , were among more than 30 travellers who boarded the German Boeing 747 to Frankfurt on Sunday afternoon . 
Among the UK nationals Chris Ramsay , 29 , an engineer from Salisbury , and Ian Lindsay , 68 , a retired general practitioner living in Dublin , had both been diagnosed with Covid 19 but Peruvian authorities allowed them to leave as they had completed the quarantine and were no longer considered to be infectious . 
" It was a great relief , " said Lindsay â€™s sister , Patricia Pacheco , who had been travelling with him along with their partners . 
" I honestly thought the Peruvian authorities would block it again . " 
The group had been turned away from a military flight sent to transfer them to Lima for the last UK repatriation flight on Wednesday following health screening . 
The acting UK ambassador in Peru , Andrew Soper tweeted : " Pleased we were able to help another group of British travellers start their journey home today , including those who had been stranded in Cusco . " 
" Thanks to our German partners for organising the flights . 
We will continue to do everything we can to support those UK nationals who remain in Peru . " 
Other travellers who were on the flight to Frankfurt included citizens from Canada , Sweden , Norway , Austria , the Netherlands and Germany .
