The Pope has warned that the coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating inequalities between the rich and the poor , as he called for universal vaccine provision , according to AFP . 
" It would be sad if , for the vaccine for Covid 19 , priority were to be given to the richest , " said Francis during his traditional Wednesday audience broadcast live from his private Vatican library . 
" It would be sad if this vaccine were to become the property of this nation or another , rather than universal and for all . " 
‘ It would be sad if the rich are given priority for the COVID 19 vaccine , ’ Pope Francis said at his weekly general audience Pharmaceutical companies are in a race to be the first to launch a vaccine against the disease , which has killed more than 782,000 people worldwide since its emergence at the end of December , according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University . 
Some governments have struck deals with companies , hoping to secure exclusive supplies of the vaccines when developed . 
Francis also said it would be a " scandal " if governments doled out pandemic related bail out money to only select industries . 
He said the criteria for companies to receive public aid should be if they " contribute to the inclusion of people who are normally excluded ( from society ) , to helping the most needy , to the common good and to caring for the environment " . 
" The pandemic is a crisis and one never exits from a crisis returning to the way it was before , " Francis said . 
" Either we leave better , or we leave worse . 
We have to leave better in order to tackle social injustices and environmental degradation . " 
The pope ’s audiences are still being held virtually from his official library inside the Vatican because of the pandemic instead of St . Peter ’s Square , previously packed with tens of thousands of people .
