There have now been more than 6.3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world since the outbreak was first detected in China at the end of 2019 , according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University . 
The US based university said that countries had reported a total of 6,318,040 cases of the virus on Tuesday , of which 376,885 had led to deaths . 
The US continues to lead the world in confirmed cases , reporting 1,817,785 , more than twice as many as the second place country , Brazil , which has reported 526,447 . 
Russia is the third worst affected country , with 423,186 confirmed cases . 
The UK is fourth , with 277,738 . 
However , testing for the virus is not widespread even in many of the world â€™s richest countries , meaning that the true extent of the outbreak is likely to be much larger .
