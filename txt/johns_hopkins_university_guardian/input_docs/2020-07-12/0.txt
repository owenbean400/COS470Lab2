A new report by Oxfam warns that the hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic could potentially kill more people each day than the infection itself , which has claimed more than half a million lives so far . 
An estimated 12,000 people per day could die from hunger linked to Covid 19 by the end of the year , Oxfam said . 
By comparison , data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the pandemic ’s deadliest day so far was 17 April , when 8,890 deaths were recorded , CNN reports . 
" The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict , climate change , inequality and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers , " Oxfam ’s interim executive director Chema Vera said in a release . 
Among the issues that have left many unable to put food on the table are lost income caused by unemployment or a reduction in remittance payments , the lack of social support for those who work in the informal economy , and disruptions to the supply chain and hurdles faced by producers . 
Also contributing to the crisis are the travel restrictions related to lockdowns , which impact not just workers and farmers , but also the delivery of humanitarian aid . 
In its briefing , Oxfam calls out food and beverage industry titans like Coca Cola , Unilever , General Mills among others . 
" Meanwhile , those at the top are continuing to make a profit : eight of the biggest food and drink companies paid out over $ 18 billion to shareholders since January even as the pandemic was spreading across the globe ― ten times more than the UN says is needed to stop people going hungry , " the release reads .
