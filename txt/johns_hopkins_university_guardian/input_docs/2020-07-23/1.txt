Trump also bragged that the US has conducted more coronavirus tests than any other country . 
Here is some context on this from the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus resource center : " In order for governments to identify new cases and effectively respond to the pandemic through tracing and treatment , testing programs should be scaled to the size of their epidemic , not the size of the population . " 
Part of the reason that US needs to conduct so much testing - even more than it is already doing â€“ is because it has had more cases of coronavirus than anywhere else in the world . 
The number of cases has reached 4,026,288 , according to Johns Hopkins University .
