Small businesses in Victoria are " giving up " after the state ’s roadmap out of coronavirus restrictions revealed Melbourne will remain under stage four lockdown for another two weeks , AAP reports . 
Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell says owners are struggling under the weight of costs , including rent , equipment leases , loans and an accumulation of worker entitlements . 
" What small businesses are telling us is that they are giving up , " she told Nine ’s Today program . 
" For many of them , they are not going to be open until the end of November . " 
Carnell said the Victorian government needed to step up and pick up some of the more prohibitive costs such as break lease fees , because " its not the business ’ fault that they ca not open , it ’s the government ’s " . 
" We are talking to the Victorian government and they will have to come to the party . " 
Premier Daniel Andrews unveiled his much anticipated four step plan to ease the nation ’s toughest coronavirus restrictions on Sunday . 
Melbourne ’s stage four restrictions will remain for another two weeks , although from 14 September the nightly curfew will start an hour later at 9pm and run until 5am . 
People living alone will also be able to nominate a friend or family member who can visit , while two hours of daily exercise will be allowed , including " social interactions " such picnics in parks or reading books at the beach . 
The curfew wo not be lifted until 26 October , with people able to leave home for non essential reasons . 
The lockdown will only lift on that date if the average number of new cases falls below five and there are fewer than five unknown source cases . 
On Sunday , Victoria recorded 63 new cases and five more deaths , taking the state ’s toll to 666 and the national figure to 753 .
