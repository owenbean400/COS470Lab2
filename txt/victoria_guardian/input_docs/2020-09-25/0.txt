We are expecting the daily case numbers for Victoria to come through shortly , with much of the state still under stage four lockdown , which means a 9pm 5am curfew and strict restrictions on travel . 
On Friday , the state ’s premier Daniel Andrews made his long awaited appearance before the hotel quarantine inquiry , which is examining how infection control protocols were breached , spreading the virus beyond the hotels housing returned international travellers . 
The virus then spread into the broader community , triggering a second wave . 
After six weeks of inquiry hearings , it is still not known who made the decision to use security guards instead of the police or the Australian Defence Force , which assisted in securing travellers in the quarantine hotels in other states . 
The premier , health minister Jenny Mikakos , jobs minister Martin Pakula and police minister Lisa Neville have all denied being involved in the decision . 
Victoria Police chief commissioner Shane Patton , his predecessor Graham Ashton , chief health officer Brett Sutton and multiple senior public servants have also pleaded ignorance . 
Andrews said he was disappointed no one in his government knows who made the fateful decision . 
" There ’s just no one who says it was them . 
Are you aware of that ? " counsel assisting the inquiry Rachel Ellyard asked . 
" I am , " the premier replied . 
" Do you know who it was ? " 
" No , I do not . "
