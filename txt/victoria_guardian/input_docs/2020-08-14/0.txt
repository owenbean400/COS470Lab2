Australia ’s Covid 19 death toll stands at 375 after a man in his 20s was among the newest casualties of the second wave outbreak in the city of Melbourne . 
The man , the youngest person to die of the virus in Australia , was among 14 people to die from the virus in Victoria on Friday , as the state recorded 372 new cases of the virus . 
It came during stage four restrictions that has seen Australia ’s second largest city placed under a long running lockdown . 
Also on Friday , a long awaited report on the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle – which saw hundreds of infections spread around the country after the ship was allowed to dock in Sydney despite having infectious patients on board – found the New South Wales Health department made multiple " serious errors " in handling the Ruby Princess , and effectively " did nothing " . 
Passengers have welcomed the findings , but some criticised the report for not going far enough after it has made no recommendations to NSW Health . 
In NSW , which has maintained low case numbers since the beginning of July , a number of outbreaks in schools looks likely to prompt further restrictions , including reports that instruments such as choirs and recorders , singing and end of year school formals may be banned . 
Meanwhile the Australian prime minister , Scott Morrison , has apologised for the government ’s role in failing to adequately prepare aged care residences for Covid 19 amid thousands of cases in Victoria , and dozens of deaths in the sector .
