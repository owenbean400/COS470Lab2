Another day of 00 , with zero cases and zero deaths . 👏 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩 👏 Well done , Victoria💓Over the coming days , and as we head to COVID normal , heads up that there will be changes to the data reported in this tweet . 
Monday will see the resumption of direct flights from New Zealand – the first international flights into Melbourne since 30 June . 
Ahead of the resumption of international arrivals , a long awaited report has suggested improvements to the state ’s quarantine program , AAP reports . 
Among the hotel quarantine inquiry ’s 69 recommendations is that overseas travellers returning to Victoria should be able to quarantine at home , potentially with an electronic ankle or wrist bracelet to track movements and enforce compliance . 
Home quarantine candidates would need to have regular Covid 19 tests during the 14 day period and face penalties if found in breach , the report said . 
The report describes home quarantine as " at least as effective as a facility based model " in preventing transmission and avoids the risk of putting people in " physical proximity with others suspected of having COVID 19 " . 
It also reduces the number of workers required , " thereby reducing the number of people potentially being exposed " . 
Those unable to quarantine at home will be accommodated at hotels located near hospitals and modified for social distancing and minimal transmission risk . 
Police would be on site 24/7 alongside units dedicated to infection prevention and control , and contact tracing . 
Staff will not be allowed to work across multiple quarantine sites or in other forms of employment . 
Victoria ’s second virus wave , which resulted in more than 18,000 infections and 800 deaths , can be traced to outbreaks among staff at the Rydges and Stamford Plaza hotels .
