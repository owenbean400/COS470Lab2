Good morning , Lisa Cox with you in Sydney for the next couple of hours . 
Just a short update on the latest events in Australia . 
Today we ’ll be watching the state of Victoria where the premier , Daniel Andrews , is expected to announce some easing of restrictions after more than 100 days of lockdown in Melbourne . 
The state recorded just one new case of Covid 19 on Saturday . 
Andrews has said Sunday ’s announcements will be " much more in the social space than in the economic space " , suggesting the government is likely to take a cautious approach to the reopening of businesses . 
News Corp is reporting this morning the government will scrap two hour limits on exercise and outdoor social activities , increase the number of people permitted to gather outdoors , and widen Melbourne ’s travel limit from 5km to 20km . 
We ’ll bring you updates as they come . 
On Saturday , the premier rejected pressure from the federal government , including the health minister , Greg Hunt , to ease restrictions in line with the state of New South Wales . 
Meanwhile , NSW remains on alert as a Covid 19 cluster in south west Sydney ’s Oran Park continues to grow and authorities urge more people to get tested .
