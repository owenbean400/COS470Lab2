Q : Do you think on grand final day we might be in position to allow bigger public gatherings or pubs to watch the game ? 
Andrews : I wish I could provide you with an answer to that question today . 
What I can say is we ’ll have ... people will have a clearer picture once we get to 18th , 19th , around that period which is just a couple of weeks away , we ’ll be in a better position to give people a clearer sense of what the following week and the weeks ahead will look like . 
If I could say it now , of course I would . 
Q : That date is 14 days away from tomorrow . 
Are you confident that the 14 day average can get down from 11.9 to five in just two weeks ? 
A : As confident as you can be . 
You ca not be certain , that ’s not the nature of this virus ... 
Hopefully to the question in relation to people gathering for the grand final – hopefully we can finish up in a situation where we have got arrangements that are pretty close to what ’s happening in regional Victoria . 
There ’ll be a big focus on outdoors but may be some inside . 
It ’s just bit too early for us to be able to say now .
