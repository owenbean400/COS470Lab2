Just back to Victoria , Australia , momentarily . 
The premier Daniel Andrews has flagged he will make an announcement on the wearing of masks next Sunday . 
That announcement could include allowing individuals who are walking alone to take masks off until they come into contact with others . 
That â€™s not for today . 
We will hopefully have a bit more to say about masks next week .
