The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking about the state ’s continued success at containing Covid 19 . 
Andrews says Victoria has now recorded 16 days without a new case . 
That ’s a remarkable turnaround for the state , easily the worst hit jurisdiction in Australia . 
Andrews : Since yesterday , that 16 days with no new cases in our state . 
We have now received results from 3,398,653 tests since the beginning of the pandemic . 
That ’s 8323 tests since yesterday . 
I want to thank those 8300 people are going and getting tested the day before . 
Getting tested is the critical thing . 
That allows us to have a complete picture , or at least the most complete picture of where this virus is , and to put a public health response around your family and then protect every family across the state , so we are very grateful and we say thank you to each and every one of those people . 
If there is one thing that people take away from the current positive news the notion of more than a fortnight now with no extra cases , the biggest and most important take to every single Victorian is , if you have symptoms , even the mildest symptoms , please go and get tested and get tested quickly .
