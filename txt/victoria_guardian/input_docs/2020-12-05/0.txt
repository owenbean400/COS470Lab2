In Australia , health and border authorities are investigating how two international passengers were allowed to fly from Sydney to Melbourne without quarantining , an act that has forced an entire planeload of domestic passengers into quarantine . 
On Saturday , two travellers thought to be from Germany arrived in Sydney , but failed to quarantine for the required two weeks before flying to Melbourne . 
Melbourne , one of Australia ’s hardest hit cities , has emerged from the grips of a Covid 19 crisis to remain free from the virus for almost a month . 
The travellers were stopped at Melbourne airport and are now completing their quarantine in Victoria , but their ability to travel freely from Sydney has prompted frustration within the Victorian state government . 
Victoria ’s health minister Martin Foley said he had sought an explanation from his New South Wales counterpart and had been assured there would be a " full investigation " . 
Victorian health authorities have also advised any other passenger travelling on the flight to quarantine for two weeks . 
The federal health minister , Greg Hunt , has also asked the Australian Border Force to investigate .
