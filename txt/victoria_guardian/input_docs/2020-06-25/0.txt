On Friday , Australia â€™s prime minister and the premiers will discuss strategies for containing localised outbreaks , a timetable for reopening arts and entertainment venues , and the return of international students when the national cabinet meets . 
It comes as Victoria is battling an outbreak of Covid 19 infections . 
After the ninth consecutive day of double digit cases in the state , the Andrews government initially requested more than 1,000 Australian defence force personnel to door knock the two Victorian suburbs at the heart of the latest outbreak , but the state government late on Thursday revised that request down to 200 to assist with testing .
