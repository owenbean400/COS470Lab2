Still in Australia : Victorian state police have warned drivers that they can lose their licence or be fined if they refuse a breath test over coronavirus fears . 
Queensland police announced on Monday that it had immediately and until further notice suspended " static " roadside breath and drug tests — that ’s when you round a corner and suddenly find yourself in a queue of cars being tested — to reduce the risk of Covid 19 transmission . 
Random single car breath and drug tests will continue . 
Victoria has taken the same approach — suspended the use of the big drug/0.05 bus but continued to do single car stops . 
And in a statement on Wednesday , Victoria Police said drivers could not refuse a breath test out of coronavirus fears .
