Australia may have extended its ban on foreign travellers from China for another week until 29 February , but Melbourne is trying to do something to make the Chinese population currently there feel more welcome . 
The Victoria state government has decided to light up a series of landmarks including the Arts Centre , the National Gallery Victoria and Melbourne town hall in red and gold as a show of solidarity with China over the coronavirus outbreak . 
Perhaps more practically , it has proposed that as soon as it is safe to visit China again , the city will send a 100 strong trade delegation . 
The premier , Daniel Andrews , has also urged people to support Chinese businesses . 
" Go and visit a Chinese restaurant , go to a precinct which is dominated by Asian businesses , go and show your support for them , because a lot of them are having it very , very tough at the moment as people stay away . "
