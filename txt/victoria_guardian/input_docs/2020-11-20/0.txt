In Australia , Victoria â€™s health minister , Martin Foley , has been speaking in Melbourne about the traces of coronavirus that were detected in sewage in the Altona catchment . 
The catchment covers suburbs including Altona , Altona Meadows , Laverton , Point Cook and Sanctuary Lakes , and residents or people who have visited are being encouraged to get tested if they have any symptoms . 
Foley says detection of the virus in wastewater was unexpected . 
" The result is really unexpected , given that there have been some eight weeks since the last known resident in these areas had a coronavirus illness or diagnosis , " he says .
