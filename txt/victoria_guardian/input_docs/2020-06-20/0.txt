There was a picnic atmosphere at Speakers ’ Corner for Saturday ’s Black Lives Matter protest with people sitting in small groups on the grass , PA Media reports . 
Four speaking points had been set up at different locations to allow demonstrators to get up and have their say . 
One demonstrator , who gave her name only as Victoria said : Before coming to the protests I was seeing everything online - all these videos of police brutality and it makes you so angry and makes you consider your own feelings about racism . 
The 23 year old , who has been to two previous Black Lives Matter demonstrations , said : When I come to these protests it is such a release , it almost feels like peace - you have family , you have people who want to understand and it ’s like a community . 
Victoria said racist comments were just a fact of life and that just before shutdown a man in a club had asked her if she was " from the ghetto " . 
Tash , 23 , joined the Black Lives Matter protests for the first time on Saturday . 
She told PA Media : This protest makes me feel hopeful but it also concerns me . 
We ’re in a pandemic and I do not want it to just be a hashtag and a trend . 
It is hopeful because people are finally listening but are they just listening because they have the time and they are bored ? 
I want to see change , I want this to be followed through . 
Describing her own experience of racism growing up in London , she said : I ’ve been asked what slave country I come from - in all seriousness - and I just think : how do I respond to that ?
