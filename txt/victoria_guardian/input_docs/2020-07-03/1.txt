Hi , I ’m Josh Taylor and I will be taking the live blog through to 9am Melbourne time on Saturday . 
In Australia , all eyes are currently on Victoria , where the state is experiencing a second spike in cases . 
We will get an update on the number of new cases identified overnight sometime later this morning , but yesterday there were 66 cases of coronavirus in Victoria . 
The number of cases has started to stabilise , but health officials will need to see if the trend continues for a few days before they can claim the spike is coming under control . 
In the meantime , suburbs in 10 postcodes in Melbourne ’s north and west remain in lockdown , and more could be added to the list if cases in those areas continue to go up . 
There is mass testing being conducted to find more positive cases , however , over 10,000 people in the state have refused tests for reasons including that they believe the coronavirus pandemic to be a conspiracy .
