A little more than a fortnight ago , people in the Australian state of Victoria were planning trips away as the school holidays approached , and looking forward to again being able to gather in pubs and restaurants with their friends – albeit with social distancing measures and hygiene protocols in place . 
Now , Melissa Davey and Matilda Boseley write , it is divided . 
While most people in Australia are enjoying these increased freedoms , 300,0000 residents across 10 postcodes – encompassing 36 suburbs – are back in lockdown , only allowed to leave their homes for exercise , healthcare , work and study if those activities ca not be done from home , and childcare .
