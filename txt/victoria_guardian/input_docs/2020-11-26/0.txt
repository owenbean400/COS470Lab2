Australia ’s second largest state , once the country ’s Covid 19 hotspot , has gone 28 days without detecting any new infections , a benchmark widely cited as eliminating the virus from the community . 
The state also has zero active cases after the last Covid 19 patient was discharged from hospital this week , a far cry from August when Victoria recorded more than 700 cases in one day and active infections totalled nearly 8,000 . 
The spread of the virus was only contained after a lockdown lasting more than 100 days , leaving some 5 million people in Melbourne , Australia ’s second largest city , largely confined to their homes . 
While the lockdown has seen infections wane , it slowed Australia ’s economic recovery from its first recession in three decades after large swathes of the country ’s economy were shut down in March . 
Australia ’s economy shrank 7 % in the three months to the end of June , the biggest quarterly decline since records began in 1959 . 
The unemployment rate hit a 22 year high of 7.5 % in July as businesses and borders closed to deal with the coronavirus . 
Still , Australia ’s nearly 28,000 Covid 19 infections recorded to date , according to health ministry data , are far fewer than in many other developed countries . 
Victoria accounts for more than 90 % of the country ’s 905 deaths .
