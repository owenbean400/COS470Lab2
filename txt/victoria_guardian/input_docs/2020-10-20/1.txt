In Victoria , the racing minister , Martin Pakula , has announced that up to 500 racehorse owners , or " connections " thereof , will be able to attend the Cox Plate race day on Saturday . 
In a statement , Pakula said that a limited number of connections of horses running on the day , and on Manikato Stakes day , will be allowed to attend the Moonee Valley track . 
Racing has continued in Victoria throughout the lockdown , although attendance has been limited to jockeys , trainers , and support staff . 
Capacity at Moonee Valley on both days will be capped at 1,250 with no more than 1,000 allowed at any one time , including jockeys , staff , security , Covid safe marshals and media – in an ordinary year the capacity is 38,000 . 
There will be time limits for how long each of the 500 " connections " can stick around , arrivals will be staggered , temperatures will be checked and owners wo not be allowed in the mounting yard and stalls . 
Pakula said : " This will give connections the chance to see their horses compete under strict health protocols."We have taken the advice of the chief health officer – I know that connections will follow the lead of jockeys , trainers and stable workers and follow all protocols to the letter . " 
It ’s unclear how this new freedom will intersect with the 25km rule – is leaving your buffer to watch the race of a horse you own shares in an essential purpose ? 
It ’s also unclear what the broader public reaction will be , given this freedom applies to a very limited few . 
The cynical ( hello ) could also view this as a prelude to further easing of restrictions for Melbourne Cup . 
The release notes that : " The government remains in discussion with the Victoria Racing Club around arrangements for the Melbourne Cup Carnival . "
