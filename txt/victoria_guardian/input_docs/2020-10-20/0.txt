Victoria ’s chief health officer , Prof Brett Sutton , has issued a brief statement , following news earlier today regarding the extraordinary sitting of the hotel quarantine inquiry . 
As expected , the inquiry is seeking some context to new evidence it has received since hearings ended in September . 
The head of the inquiry , Jennifer Coate , announced earlier this afternoon that she would be seeking an affidavit from Sutton explaining how it was that he was included in an email about private security use in the hotel quarantine program well before he said he was aware of it . 
Sutton said he had fully cooperated with the inquiry and took his obligations seriously . 
" The board of inquiry has a job to do and I respect the work the board is doing . " 
The Department of Health and Human Services issued a slightly more detailed statement , saying it would " urgently " respond to Coate ’s requests for more information . 
Earlier , Coate indicated the new evidence could mean the inquiry may not meet the 6 November reporting date , but could not say when its work would be completed .
