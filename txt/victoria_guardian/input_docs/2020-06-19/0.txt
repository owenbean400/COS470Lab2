In Australia , authorities are watching the rise in coronavirus cases in Victoria closely as the state prepares to further ease restrictions from Monday . 
Gyms , cinemas , indoor sports centres and concert venues are scheduled to reopen on Monday while cafes , restaurants and pubs will increase capacity from 20 people to 50 . 
Thirteen new cases were recorded on Friday , 18 on Thursday and 21 on Wednesday , resulting in the state ’s biggest increase in more than a month . 
While the rest of the country ’s Covid 19 infections decline , Victoria ’s active cases rose to 91 on Friday , up from 66 four weeks ago . But health authorities said they were relieved to know the links to most of the new cases , many of them returned travellers or close contacts of returned travellers . 
" We ’re hoping that this is not the beginning of a second wave and we ’re doing everything we absolutely can to make sure that that ’s not the case , " Victorian deputy chief health officer Annaliese van Diemen said .
