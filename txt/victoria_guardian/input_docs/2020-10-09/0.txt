Victoria has reported 14 new coronavirus cases and no deaths in the past 24 hours . 
The Victorian premier , Daniel Andrews , is expected to give a further update this morning in what will be his 100th consecutive day of fronting up to the media . 
Melbourne has been in a hard lockdown since early July as the state experienced a second wave of the coronavirus . 
While restrictions have eased in regional areas of the state , in the city a five kilometre movement restriction for only essential travel and gathering bans remain . 
That lockdown will stay unless the city ’s rolling 14 day average drops to five cases or less , with only five cases of community transmission over that same time . 
The average right now is 9.4 . 
On Friday the state recorded 11 cases and no deaths . 
In NSW , that state recorded five new local cases on Friday but these were all linked to a known cluster . 
A health alert was issued late Friday when a nurse at St Vincent ’s Hospital in Sydney tested posted . 
The nurse " had limited contact with a very small number of colleagues " , health authorities said . 
The opening of state borders continues to create political tension in Australia . 
Queensland , which has only four people currently with the virus , is relatively open , and has its border closed to most of New South Wales and all of Victoria . 
The NSW premier , Gladys Berejiklian , and the Australian prime minister , Scott Morriso , n have both been trying to pressure Queensland to open up . 
Queensland is in election mode , with polls closing on 31 October .
