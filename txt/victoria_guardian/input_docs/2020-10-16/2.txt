Tim Wilson , a federal Australian government MP , says he does not see any problem with news that 17 New Zealanders have made it to locked down city of Melbourne . 
The New Zealanders travelled to Sydney under a new travel bubble arrangement , allowing them to travel without quarantine . 
But the travel bubble does not extend to Victoria and the state is not taking international travellers . 
Wilson : Well , to be frank , I do not really understand what the issue is ... 
New South Wales are accepting flights as part of the trans Tasman bubble from New Zealand . 
There is no quarantine obligations when people go from New South Wales into Victoria . 
There is in reverse . 
So , once people have arrived here and have been assessed ultimately as safe , then the ordinary pathways for people to be able to travel into Victoria , if they wish to do so . 
So , I want to know what the basis of – and it ’s not clear to me what the basis of , is there a new quarantine requirement to go into Victoria ? 
I ’m in the ACT right now . 
If I go to Victoria , I ’m not expected to quarantine , because it is not a source of Covid 19 .
