In Australia , 17 passengers who travelled to Australia from New Zealand have been caught trying to enter the locked down city of Melbourne . 
The two countries announced a travel bubble to allow limited international travel for some citizens earlier this month , and three flights from New Zealand touched down at Sydney Airport on Friday , prompting joyous scenes . 
But the travel bubble arrangement was not extended to the state of Victoria and its capital Melbourne , a city hit hard by Covid 19 , which is not accepting any international passengers . 
Seventeen passengers from New Zealand flew to Sydney before taking a connecting flight to Melbourne . 
The state ’s health authorities say they do not have the legal authority to detain the travellers . 
But the state said it did " not expect to receive international travellers " as a result of other states making arrangements with New Zealand . 
" The Victorian Government has made it clear to the Commonwealth that we expect NZ passengers who have not undertaken quarantine will not be permitted to board flights in Sydney bound for Melbourne , " the Victoria ’s Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement .
