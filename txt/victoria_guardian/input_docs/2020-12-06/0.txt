The Australian state of Victoria has announced a significant easing of its Covid 19 restrictions , opening up the state in time for summer . 
Victoria , once the worst hit state in the country , has enjoyed 37 straight days free from Covid 19 . 
The result allowed premier Daniel Andrews to announce a relaxation of Covid 19 restrictions . 
Victorians will , as of midnight local time , be allowed to have 30 visitors daily to their home from any number of other households , a doubling of the previous limit of 15 . 
Outdoor public gatherings can now also have 100 people from any household . 
Private sector offices can welcome back 50 % of their employees , up from the current 25 % , from Monday 11 January . 
Public sector workplaces will bring back 25 % of their employees on the same date , increasing to 50 % on 8 February . 
Weddings and religious gatherings are now only required to have one person for every two square metres , with no cap on the total number of people . 
Bars , pubs , and cafes will also move to the one person per two square metres rule for indoor and outdoor venues from midnight , with no cap on the total number of patrons . 
Standing service will now be allowed again , meaning patrons do not have to be seated at bars to be served . 
Dance floors will be required to have one person for every four square metres . 
Mask wearing will still be mandatory in indoor shopping centres and public transport , and masks must still be carried by Victorians at all times . 
" 37 days in a row is an amazing achievement , " Andrews said . 
" And every Victorian should be proud but this thing is not done or over and can come back and if we do not play our part and remain vigilant , then we do run the risk of everything that we have built being compromised . 
That is why we have all got to remain vigilant . "
