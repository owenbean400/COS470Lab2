Victoria is understandably a little jumpy about the hotel quarantine system , and Cowie is stressing that positive results were " anticipated " . 
He â€™s running through the way the scheme works , and explaining that when new arrivals appear at Melbourne airport they are either sent to hotel quarantine or to a health hotel if they have symptoms .
