A website set up to allow Victorians to access regional travel vouchers crashed within minutes on Friday , AAP reports . 
Business Victoria says 40,000 vouchers offered as part of the first round of the state government ’s Regional Travel Voucher Scheme have run out . 
Holidaymakers hoping to snap up one of the Victorian government ’s $ 200 regional tourism offers prompted the application website to crash within minutes on Friday morning , having opened at 10am . 
Those intending to spend two or more nights in regional Victoria between Saturday and 22 January 2021 were able to apply . 
Business Victoria said the website received 800,000 visits by Friday at 5pm . 
Eligible destinations under the $ 28m scheme , announced as part of a $ 300m state budget tourism package last month , include the Yarra Valley , Mornington Peninsula and Bellarine Peninsula . 
" If those $ 200 vouchers mean people stay an extra night , maybe go to a local pub or restaurant . 
That ’s all about wages and spending and investment , " Premier Daniel Andrews said on Thursday .
