As tense South Australians swirled around Unley Shopping Centre on Wednesday afternoon trying to figure out what to buy for their first full lockdown – " screw essentials , I need ice cream ! " 
– council worker Anne Ross was standing in the long queue for the supermarket , calmly preparing for her third time around . 
Ross had secured an exemption to enter SA from her home state of Victoria several weeks earlier , escorted by police to Adelaide , so she could grieve with relatives after her mother died . 
Little did she anticipate how the tables would turn . 
" Now I ’m stuck here , " she tells Guardian Australia with a laugh .
