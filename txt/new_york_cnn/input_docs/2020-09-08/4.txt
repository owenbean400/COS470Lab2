The state of Connecticut has added four states — Delaware , Maryland , Ohio , and West Virginia — to its travel advisory list . 
" They have a higher infection rate , which is the criterion we have for whether you can fly in without quarantining or not , " Gov . 
Ned Lamont explained to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . 
" We 're a small state , we 're a region that 's got a very low infection rate . 
And so far we 've been at less than 1 % for over three months . 
We want to keep it that way . " 
Amid the Covid 19 global pandemic , Connecticut joined neighboring New York and New Jersey in a regional approach to protecting against the virus . 
Lamont pointed to air travel as a key component in this strategy . 
" They fly into Kennedy [ International ] Airport , they fly into La Guardia [ Airport , ] they drive up here to Connecticut . 
And it makes sense for us to do this together , " the governor told the host of CNN 's " The Situation Room . " 
" Obviously Newark International Airport gets people from all over the world . 
It made good sense for us to do this . " 
Meanwhile , on the first Tuesday after Labor Day , Lamont noted the challenges facing children as they look to return to the classroom . 
" We 've opened up our schools . 
Many of them full time , some of them on a hybrid basis . 
These kids had not been to school for many months , " he said . 
" We 're going to do this , but we 're going to do it very , very carefully , " he said of the educational plan , adding " we 're going to walk before we run . " 
As the number of Covid 19 deaths continues to rise , Lamont assured his state is taking every precaution to keep kids and their teachers safe . 
" Look , we 're requiring the masks , we 've got all the toughest disinfecting standards , " he said . 
" Some of those school districts that are a little more crowded , they only have half days or half classes just to spread people out . "
