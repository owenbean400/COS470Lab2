New York will publicly disclose a Covid 19 " report card " for every school in the state , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday . 
" Every school district has to report every day to the department of health as to how many tests were taken , what type of test , what was the result , " and all that information will be available online , he said . 
The state will keep track of the data provided by the school district , local health department , and lab that does the testing . 
He is signing an executive order today to ensure this data is collected . 
The governor demonstrated the platform and what will be available including the following : Positive cases by date of student and staff by school and school district Whether that school district is remote , in person or hybrid The number of students and staff on site The percentage of on site students and staff who test positive The number of tests being administered by the school , the test type , the lab used and lag time The date of the last submission and update . 
As K 12 schools reopen with a bevy of combinations from remote , to hybrid , to in person learning , Cuomo said its " imperative " to track the infection rate by school and district to determine potential spread . 
Cuomo said parents and teachers are still nervous , and the school plans are only as good as their implementation .
