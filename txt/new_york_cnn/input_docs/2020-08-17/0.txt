Gyms can open as soon as August 24 with 33 % capacity and mask mandates , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Monday . 
Guidance on gym reopening will be issued Monday , he said , adding that it will also outline other health requirements that have to be maintained with regards to ventilation . 
Local governments must inspect gyms before they reopen or within two weeks of their opening to make sure facilities are meeting all requirements . 
Gyms must open by September 2 , he said . 
" That variation is to give localities time if the localities need it , " he said , adding " if the localities can get the inspections done or be ready to inspect , then they can open up August 24th , if a locality cant get ready to do inspections , then they get another week they can do it September 2nd . " 
Local government can determine whether gyms can hold indoor classes .
