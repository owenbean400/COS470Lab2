New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said that he is " hopeful that at the end of the day , we have what we need " in terms of ventilators in the state . 
But he noted that it has become increasingly difficult for him to purchase ventilators because " FEMA came in and is now capturing the market " for the equipment . 
He said FEMA , " big footed the states . " 
He said that is why " federal distribution is so important . " 
Remember : Cuomo has said in the the past several days that New York may need up to 40,000 ventilators based on the scientific projections for the apex of cases there .
