While New York state still leads the nation — by far — in growing numbers of Covid 19 cases and deaths , the rate of daily increases did appear to slow a bit in the last seven days An analysis of CNN 's count shows that the state ’s average rate of day over day increase for the last seven days was 17 % — compared to 58 % for the previous seven day period . 
This is in line with what New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested in a news conference Monday . 
" There is no doubt that the number is still increasing . 
There is no doubt that rate has slowed , " Cuomo said . 
" We had a doubling of cases every two days , then the doubling of three days and doubling of four days and every five days and we now have a doubling of cases every six days . " 
It is too early to definitively pinpoint what 's behind the latest numbers trend , though New York is just over one week into its " PAUSE " program , an executive order outlining major restrictions and other containment measures . 
It is also important to note that increased testing can impact these numbers . 
While more testing often leads to higher case totals , it can also lead to a backlog of test results and a delay in the true number . 
When it comes to death rate reports , CNN 's count shows that New York state had an average daily increase of 34 % for the last seven days , compared to 61 % for the previous week . 
But death rate increases are much harder to interpret , since patients die over longer periods of time . 
CNN 's tally is based on daily updates obtained from state and local health authorities .
