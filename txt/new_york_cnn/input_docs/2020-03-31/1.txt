Amazon has terminated an employee based in the company 's Staten Island , New York , warehouse after he participated in a worker walkout protesting the company 's response to the novel coronavirus . 
Amazon confirmed the firing Monday night , telling CNN Business in a statement that the employee , Christian Smalls , was supposed to be under quarantine . 
The firing follows the protest partly organized by Smalls , who had called on Amazon to shut down the Staten Island facility for deep cleaning after multiple cases of the coronavirus emerged there . 
In an interview on Sunday , Smalls told CNN he had spent the past week trying to persuade senior warehouse officials to close the building and sterilize it , but to no avail . 
Monday 's protest saw more than a dozen people walk off the job at around lunchtime , according to Amazon and a livestream of the event viewed by CNN . 
In a phone interview Monday night after his firing , Smalls said he is being singled out for punishment and that his firing reflects a culture of apathy at Amazon .
