British Airways and Delta Airlines have agreed to test all passengers before they enter New York state , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo announced Monday afternoon . 
Cuomo also asked Virgin Atlantic to join those airlines in voluntary testing passengers before boarding flights to New York . 
The news comes after a new Covid 19 variant was reported in England , prompting some countries to ban travel from the United Kingdom . 
Remember : There is no evidence the new coronavirus variants are any more virulent , meaning they do not cause more severe disease . 
They do not appear to impact the effects of treatments or the protection offered by vaccines .
