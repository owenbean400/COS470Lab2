The Defense Department expects to announce today that 11 additional military housing locations have been approved to accept people for quarantine if public health authorities believe there are coronavirus concerns , according to two US officials . 
The request for the additional military housing has come from the Department of Health and Human Services and has been preliminarily approved by the Pentagon . 
The list of housing sites has not yet been made public but they are located near 11 designated commercial airports where planes carrying US citizens who have recently been in China must land , the officials said . 
Those airports are : John F . Kennedy in New York , Los Angeles , Seattle , San Francisco , Chicago , Atlanta , Honolulu , Dallas , Detroit , Newark and Washington 's Dulles . 
The expectation is relatively small numbers of people will have to be housed as they come off those commercial flights , officials said . 
Health authorities will be in charge of making those decisions . 
The request estimates about 20 beds per site may be needed . 
The officials said these will be sites used after other military sites and public health sites are full . 
This is different than the initial charter flights flying from mainland China directly to military facilities where the Pentagon was told to be ready for approximately 1,000 people , the officials said .
