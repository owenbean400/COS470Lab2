New York is facing a revenue shortfall of $ 10-15 billion , State Budget Director Robert F . Mujica , Jr . said on Friday . 
" ( Revenue from the federal government ) did not materialize so in the absence of that we have to recognize that we could lose between 10 and $ 15 billion , " Mujica said . 
" What we 'll do is throughout the year we are going to look at revenues , look at the spending forecasts , and reduce our spending to reflect what we think the revenues are going to look like . " 
The state 's economy is essentially on pause , meaning future forecasts will depend on whether the federal government can provide the state with additional revenue , he added .
