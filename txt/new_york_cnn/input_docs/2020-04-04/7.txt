Nurses from Atlanta are flying to New York City to help treat coronavirus patients . 
Letha Love , an Atlanta ICU nurse , said she was shocked by what she saw when she arrived . 
This comes after New York City sent an emergency alert to phones , asking all licensed health care workers to support the city 's health facilities . 
Love said she was originally planning to stay 3 to 6 weeks , but might return to Atlanta earlier . 
" I do whatever it takes to protect myself so that I can go back to my kids healthy and strong . 
But this is a lot . 
It 's a lot . 
And people need to take it serious , " she said . 
Love said most of the patients she has worked with in New York so far have been intubated , but she wants their family members to know that nurses and other health professionals are taking care of them . 
" We would not come here if we were not going to take care of them , " she said . 
" We came there to take care of them " New York currently has 103,169 coronavirus cases and 2,935 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
