Front line responders in New York City , the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the US , are facing " battlefield conditions , " said Michael Greco , Vice President of the New York City Fire Department Bureau of Emergency Medical Services ( FDNY EMS ) union . 
" We ’re now in a major triage mode , " he told CNN . 
" If we do not get a return of circulation , after 20 minutes we are terminating the CPR and we are not transporting . " 
The hour or so that they spend transporting patients to hospital is now " battlefield triage , " he said . 
" We ’re in wartime mode . " 
Greco said that before the coronavirus outbreak , he and other paramedics would see perhaps one or two cardiac arrests a week . 
One FDNY EMS crew handled seven cardiac arrests yesterday alone . 
Emergency workers are fearing for their lives : Some members are sleeping in their cars or hotel rooms , afraid they could get infected and bring the virus to their homes and families , Greco said .
