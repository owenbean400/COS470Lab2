Each day seems to bring more bad news for Tokyo . 
The daily count of new coronavirus cases has doubled in the past week , from about 40 in the final days of March to 97 on Thursday and 89 on Friday , according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government . 
If the current trend continues , the outlook is bleak , said Kentaro Iwata , an infection control specialist from Kobe University , who has repeatedly warned that Japan is not doing enough to halt the spread of the virus . 
New York is considered the epicenter of America 's coronavirus outbreak . 
There , the number of known cases is doubling every five days , according to a CNN count . 
More than 2,900 people have died . 
As of Friday , Japan had 3,329 confirmed cases and 74 deaths . 
Iwata added there needs to be more testing : As of Friday , Tokyo had tested fewer than 4,000 people in a city of 13.5 million . 
And just 39,466 people had been tested in this nation of 125 million , according to the Ministry of Health , Labour , and Welfare . 
That 's a tiny fraction compared to countries in the region and around the world . 
As of Friday , South Korea -- which has a much smaller population than Japan -- had tested more than 440,000 people .
