New York resident Maura Lewinger says her husband , Joe , wrote her love letters every morning and left them in her lunch box . 
They were not just the " have a great day " letters , she said , but they described what she meant to him and maybe their plans for the next day or the upcoming weekend . 
" He always took care of me , got me my coffee and help me in every way , " she told CNN Friday . 
Joe , 42 , died last weekend from complications with coronavirus . 
Like other families across the US right now , Lewinger had to say goodbye to her husband virtually . 
When doctors told Lewinger her husband 's breathing was getting worse and that he was on three different blood pressure medications , she requested to speak with Joe on Face Time . 
" I saw him and I begged him not to leave us and told him we all need him , " Lewinger said . 
Doctors told her they 'd try other methods to keep Joe alive . 
During that waiting period , Lewinger told CNN she listened to her wedding song on loop just staring into the backyard . 
Then the doctor called back . 
" I played our wedding song for him . 
And then that was it , " Lewinger said . 
Joe leaves behind his wife , a son and two daughters .
