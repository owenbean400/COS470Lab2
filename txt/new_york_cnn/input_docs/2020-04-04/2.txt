Kelley Bradshaw , an intensive care unit nurse at a large New York hospital , told CNN the coronavirus patients she 's seeing this week seem sicker , with more advanced symptoms . 
Bradshaw said she was seeing more cases of the virus affecting patients ' kidneys and hearts . 
It 's not clear if the patients seem sicker because the virus is presenting itself in a different way , or if the patients are trying to wait it out at home , so they are already sicker by the time they arrive at the hospital . 
" It just feels like the longer someone battles this virus and the more critically ill they become , the harder our job gets , " Bradshaw said . 
" The days are really , really long ... 
The only thing we can expect is to expect the unexpected . "
