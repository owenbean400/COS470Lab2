As several states make plans for reopening their communities during the coronavirus pandemic , a group of top public health experts cautioned Tuesday against reopening society before testing capacity expands significantly . 
Different parts of the country are in different stages of the epidemic , with New York well into the first wave and other places just beginning to see the impact of the disease . 
This matters , said Dr . Caroline Buckee , Harvard associate professor of epidemiology and the associate director of the university ’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics . 
Knowing the location of the virus is key to relaxing social distancing and returning to normalcy , Buckee told a symposium sponsored by Harvard ’s T.H . Chan School of Public Health and the New England Journal of Medicine . 
The lack of testing capacity is a big problem because the disease has " a very broad clinical spread , " Buckee said . 
So even when people show up at the hospital and get tested there are many more cases in the community , including mild and asymptomatic cases . 
" And those are the people that are spreading the disease , " she said . 
It ’s important to learn whether people who have recovered can still spread the disease , noted NEJM editor Dr . Eric Rubin . 
Buckee added that without knowing the answers , the nation could reopen too soon and risk a deadly second pandemic wave . 
" Right now , we do not have good estimates for where we are on the epidemic curve in different places . 
So , discussions of relaxation of physical distance , which do seem to be having an effect , curbing some of the worst impacts of the outbreak , need to be based on the capacity to test people so we know where we are , " she said .
