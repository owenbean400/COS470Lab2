New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that US President Donald Trump agreed to take ownership of the national supply chain to get coronavirus testing kit manufacturers the supplies they need to produce kits The problem with bringing testing up to scale is the national manufacturers who make the testing kits and send them to state labs , Cuomo said . 
Those companies say they have a problem with the supply chain getting swabs , vials and chemicals to produce the testing kits , Cuomo added . 
The governor said his meeting at the White House was " very productive , positive , got a lot done . " 
Some of the meeting focused on the importance of dividing the responsibilities between states and federal government to scale up testing , he said . 
The state will be responsible for managing diagnostic and antibody testing , who to test , where to test and tracing cases , Cuomo said . 
The goal is to double New York State â€™s testing from 20,000 diagnostic tests to 40,000 diagnostic and antibody tests , he said . 
" It will take several weeks at best , this is an enormous undertaking , " Cuomo added .
