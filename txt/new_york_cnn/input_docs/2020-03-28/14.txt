Andrew Cuomo told CNN he would sue Rhode Island if they did not roll back a policy of stopping all cars with New York license plates , but that he expects the two states will be able to work it out amicably . 
" That clearly is unconstitutional , " Cuomo said , adding he understands Rhode Island 's goal of trying to slow the spread of coronavirus . 
" But there 's a point of absurdity , and I think what Rhode Island did is at the point of absurdity . 
Again , it is not even legal , " he said . 
No state should be using police to prohibit interstate travel in any way , Cuomo said .
