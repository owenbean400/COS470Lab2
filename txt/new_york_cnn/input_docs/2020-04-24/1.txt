The travel ban implemented by US President Donald Trump on China in late January did little to halt the spread of coronavirus to the US , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said . 
" It had already left China , " said Cuomo , when asked by CNN Thursday evening if the travel ban had made a difference . 
" The strain in New York came from Europe , it did not come from China . " 
Speaking earlier during CNN 's coronavirus town hall , Cuomo said he believed the US and even medical experts were hardly prepared for a global pandemic of this scale . 
" We 've never actually lived through ( a global pandemic ) , " he said . 
" So I do not think that this country was ready for it . 
I do not even think our experts were ready for it . "
