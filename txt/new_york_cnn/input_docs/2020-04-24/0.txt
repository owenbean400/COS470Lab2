Preliminary results of a large scale study of hydroxychloroquine suggest that the drug " did not really have much of an effect on the recovery rate , " New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said during CNN 's town hall Thursday evening . 
The study , sponsored by the New York state Department of Health , looked at about 600 patients at 22 hospitals in the greater New York City area . 
Those who took hydroxychloroquine , with or without the antibiotic azithromycin , were no more likely to survive their infections than those who did not , according to David Holtgrave , dean of the University at Albany School of Public Health , who conducted the study . 
Some more background : Since hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are both already on the market for other illnesses , doctors are free to prescribe them to coronavirus patients if they want to , and the Albany study found that doctors did often use them to treat their coronavirus patients . 
Dr . William Schaffner , a Vanderbilt University infectious disease expert who was not involved in the Albany report , said while it 's hardly the last word on the issue , he hopes it will guide doctors who are considering prescribing it to their hospitalized patients . 
" This study is not a red light . 
It 's a yellow caution light , " he said . 
This post was updated to more clearly reflect the size of the hydroxychloroquine study .
