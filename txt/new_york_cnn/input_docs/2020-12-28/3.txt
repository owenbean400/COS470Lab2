New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said he will be signing an executive order Monday that would fine up to a million dollars as well as a revocation of licenses for those who knowingly break the law when it comes to fraud and the Covid 19 vaccine . 
The order would include doctors , nurses , pharmacists or any licensed health care professional . 
The news comes as the New York Health Department is reviewing the actions of health care provider Par Care . 
" The vaccine is a valuable commodity and you have many people that want the vaccine and you will have fraud in the vaccine process , " Cuomo said . 
He later said , " The vaccines are a priority , no politics at play at who gets a vaccine , we will not tolerate any fraud in the vaccination process . " 
Cuomo said his office is looking at one health care provider who might have committed fraud . 
The governor , who did not mention the name of the company , said the New York State Police has reviewed the facts and referred it to New York Attorney General ’s office . 
Asked specifically during the question and answer portion of the briefing about Par Care , Cuomo said , " the state police believe there ’s enough evidence to commence a criminal investigation and hence the referral to the office of the Attorney General . " 
CNN is reaching out to the Office of the Attorney General who earlier Monday issued a general warning alerting New Yorkers to potential scams offering early access to Covid 19 vaccines . 
She did not name a company in particular . 
The New York Department of Health this weekend said that an Orange County provider may have transferred the Covid 19 vaccine to facilities in other parts of the state in violation of state guidelines and administered it to members of the public " contrary to the state 's plan to administer it first to frontline health care workers , as well as nursing home residents and staffers . " 
CNN reported that Par Care was the provider .
