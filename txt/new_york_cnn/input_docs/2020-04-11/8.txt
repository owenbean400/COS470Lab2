No decisions have been made on whether or not to reopen businesses in New York , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Saturday at a press conference . 
He said he will not reopen businesses in the city without coordinating it with other localities . 
" Coordinate school and business , and coordinate geographically , " he said . 
He said there are a variety of options on how to proceed with , and when , to reopen the economy in the state . 
" We ’ll discuss it , we ’ll coordinate it but at the end of the day the decision must be at a minimum for the metropolitan area , hopefully statewide , ideally regional with Connecticut and New Jersey . 
So that ’s my goal , " Cuomo said . 
Cuomo acknowledged Mayor Bill de Blasio who said earlier today that New York City schools will remained closed for the rest of the academic school year . 
" There has been no decision , that ’s the mayor 's opinion , I value it " along with all the other county executives but " the decision will be coordinated among all of them , " Cuomo said . 
Regarding the mayor ’s position of closing schools until June , Cuomo said " we may do that , but we 're going to do it in a coordinated sense with the other localities , " including the counties in New York .
