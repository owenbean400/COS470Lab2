At New York City ’s Bellevue Hospital , a makeshift morgue including tents and refrigerated trucks is being set up in preparation for what may be a surge in the need for autopsies . 
" We 're in a public health crisis , and the city has declared a state of emergency . 
As part of that declaration , agencies like OCME have enacted emergency contingency plans to help prepare for every possible outcome , " New York City ’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said in a statement to CNN . 
A similar plan was utilized after September 11 attacks . 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has a request from New York and other states for assistance in mortuary operations . 
" FEMA ’s National Response Coordination Center ( NRCC ) has received requests for HHS Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams ( DMORT ) from the States of Hawaii , New York , and North Carolina . 
These requests are currently in the review and approval process , " a FEMA spokesperson told CNN . 
New York City has longstanding contracts with companies to also provide refrigerated trucks to store bodies , but that plan has not been put in to effect just yet . 
If and when it is , those trucks would likely be stationed at various locations including makeshift hospitals such as the Javits Center .
