Evidence is emerging that injury to the heart may be a common condition among people hospitalized with Covid 19 , according to a new study , and it ’s linked to a greater risk of death for those patients . 
The study , published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology on Wednesday , found that among a group of 416 adult Covid 19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan , China , 82 patients — 19.7 % — had cardiac injury . 
The death rate was higher among patients with cardiac injury versus those without : 42 of the patients with cardiac injury died — 51.2 % — versus 15 of those without cardiac injury , or 4.5 % . 
Cardiac injury , sometimes also referred to as myocardial injury , occurs when there is damage to heart muscle and such damage can occur when blood flow to the heart is reduced — vwhich is what causes a heart attack . 
Though the study showed cardiac injury is a common condition among patients hospitalized with Covid 19 , it did not indicate whether Covid 19 directly causes cardiac injury . 
The authors state the mechanism of cardiac injury among these patients with Covid 19 remains uncertain , and more evidence is needed to demonstrate Covid 19 directly injures the heart . 
Another key " is the potentially important long term issue , " said Brooks Gump , the Falk Family Endowed Professor of Public Health at Syracuse University in New York , who was not involved in the study . 
" Many patients who pull through may still have cardiac injury and associated long term cardiovascular issues as a consequence of Covid 19 infection . "
