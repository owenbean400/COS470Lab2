New York Blood Center will be the first blood center to collect blood plasma donations from individuals who have recovered from Covid 19 in order to treat other patients with serious or immediately life threatening coronavirus infections , NYBC said in a press statement today . 
The process , known as convalescent plasma , involves doctors testing the plasma of people who recovered for antibodies to the virus and then injecting that plasma , or a derivative of it , into the sick person . 
The US Food and Drug Administration announced it â€™s expediting the use of a blood plasma treatment for patients seriously ill with the coronavirus , making it easier for doctors to try another tool to attack the illness . 
New York Blood Center will maintain a bank for patients after it collects donations and processes the plasma for infusions . 
" Qualified donors will be referred to NYBC by area hospitals and the Food and Drug Administration will approve patients for the treatment on a case by case basis , " according to the center .
