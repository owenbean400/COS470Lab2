New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the Senate 's $ 2 trillion stimulus bill would be " terrible for state of New York . " 
He said that based on the way the bill is written New York 's government would only get $ 3.8 billion . 
He added that " sounds like a lot of money " â€” but it 's not considering he estimates the state is looking at a revenue shortfall of $ 9 to 15 billion and response has already cost New York $ 1 billion . 
Cuomo added that in the Senate bill , New York City gets $ 1.3 billion , which he called a " drop in the bucket . " 
He continued by saying that he has spoken to New York 's House delegation . 
" I said to them , ' this does not do it , ' " adding , " We need the House to make adjustments . "
