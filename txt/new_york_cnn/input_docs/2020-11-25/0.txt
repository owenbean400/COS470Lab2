A poodle in Hong Kong has tested positive for Covid 19 , Hong Kong 's Agriculture , Fisheries and Conservation Department ( AFCD ) said Wednesday . 
The dog was sent to quarantine on November 20 after its owner had been in close contact with a confirmed Covid 19 case , the AFCD said . 
" Samples collected from the dog by the department tested positive for the COVID 19 virus , " AFCD added . 
The poodle , who lives in Hong Kong 's Tsuen Wan district , is not showing any symptoms at the moment . 
The AFCD said that it would continue to " closely monitor the dog and conduct repeat testing . " 
The department added that it was urging pet owners to adopt good hygiene practices and avoid kissing their animals , but emphasized that there is currently " no evidence to show that pets are playing a role in the spread of infection with the COVID 19 virus among humans . " 
But scientists say continued testing is one way to remain vigilant in the face of a previously unknown pathogen . 
In the US , the vast majority of the tests have been in household cats and dogs with suspicious respiratory symptoms . 
In June , the United States Drug Administration reported that a pooch in New York was the first pet dog to test positive for the coronavirus after falling ill and struggling to breathe . 
The dog , a 7 year old German Shepherd named Buddy , later died . 
Officials determined he 'd contracted the virus from his owner .
