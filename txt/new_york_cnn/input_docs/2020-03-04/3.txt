A total of six people across New York are infected with coronavirus , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said today . 
The state 's first case is a healthcare worker who had recently returned from Iran . 
She has been isolated at her home in Manhattan along with her husband . 
As of Wednesday , the husband does not have coronavirus , Cuomo said . 
The 5 other cases include the city 's first case of community spread -- meaning the source of infection is unknown . 
That patient , an attorney in his 50s , is in critical condition at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center . 
The man has an underlying respiratory condition which made him more vulnerable to the virus , said Dr . Howard Zucker , commissioner of the New York State Department of Health . 
Now the man 's wife , son , daughter , and a neighbor who drove the sick man to the hospital are all infected with coronavirus , Cuomo said . 
His 20 year old son attends Yeshiva University in Manhattan and his 14 year old daughter attends SAR Academy and High School in the Bronx .
