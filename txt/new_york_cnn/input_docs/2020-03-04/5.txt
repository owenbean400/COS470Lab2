Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said the United States should be proactive when it comes to testing for the coronavirus . 
Fauci explained what he means by proactive testing : Fauci explained that there are not enough resources to have this at every single emergency room in the country . 
" So what the CDC has done , they 've started by taking six sentinel cites and now they are expanding that to many more cities . 
Essentially doing sentinel surveillance in surveillance in different places . 
And that will give us a good idea or at least a partially good idea of what 's under the radar screen that we 're missing , " Fauci said . 
CDC has said the six cities are Los Angeles , San Francisco , Honolulu , New York , Chicago and Seattle .
