As confidence grows that the state may be nearing its peak of new coronavirus cases , Washington Gov . 
Jay Inslee announced Wednesday they are giving back a military field hospital that was intended to deal with a surge of patients . 
The hospital – set up at an event center adjacent to the Century Link Field sports stadium in Seattle – will be available to FEMA to be redeployed to another state . 
" We requested this resource before our physical distancing strategies were fully implemented and we had considerable concerns that our hospitals would be overloaded with Covid 19 cases , " Inslee said in a statement . 
The decision to return it was made with the approval of the leaders of the Seattle and King County governments . 
Inslee said the state still has the ability to increase its hospital capacity by 1,000 beds quickly in case of a surge , even without the military hospital . 
The decision comes three days after Inslee returned more than 400 ventilators the state received from the Strategic National Stockpile back to the federal government . 
At the time , Inslee said Washington had a sufficient supply of ventilators on its own , while states like New York faced a bigger immediate need .
