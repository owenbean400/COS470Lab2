New York yesterday reported its deadliest day yet during the coronavirus pandemic . 
While New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio says officials have seen some progress in fighting the virus , he cautions against relaxing social distancing guidelines . 
" We surpassed the number of people who died in the World Trade Center in the last couple of days . 
… We 've got to realize just how destructive this is , " he added . 
The mayor said the city has enough ventilators to last for the week , but he ’s not sure about next week due to the " unpredictable " nature of the virus . 
" For the first time , we got a bit of breathing room . 
I can tell you we can get through this week , we got great help from the federal government and the state government . 
But also the number of people who need them finally is leveling off a little , " he said , but advises " we ’re not out of the woods . " 
De Blasio also said his administration is looking to further educate and support minority communities regarding the dangers of coronavirus , which is affecting black and Latino Americans at a higher rate . 
" This disease , unfortunately , it amplifies the horrible health disparities that already exist , " he said .
