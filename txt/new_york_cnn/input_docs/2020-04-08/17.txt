In a call with reporters Wednesday , local and county officials with the National Association of Counties raised the alarm that the federal response to Covid 19 has left counties in the lurch and without resources . 
Much of the challenges they â€™re facing involve meeting budgets and hitting revenue targets , which have been sorely hit by states closing businesses nationwide . 
Cook County , Illinois , Board President Toni Preckwinkle was among the county officials who was on the call . 
Preckwinkle said they have " faced some tremendous challenges around personal protective equipment ... there 's been , I can only say , an inadequate and chaotic federal response to this . " 
Mark Poloncarz , who serves as the county executive for Erie County , New York , echoed that sentiment . 
" We 've had a number of orders that we processed with reputable partners to get N95 masks and the like , almost all of these are made overseas , and of course , there have been delays . 
We 've heard the stories about where vendors are processing an order and then your order comes back a few days later and you 've been told you 're not getting it anymore , primarily because they 're selling it to someone else . 
So , we are all kind of in the same boat with regards to this across the country , " Poloncarz said .
