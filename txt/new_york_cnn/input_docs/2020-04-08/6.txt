Dr . Anthony Fauci , the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said , " It ’s going to be a bad week for deaths . " 
Speaking on Fox News , Fauci said in New York there is a decrease in hospitalizations , admissions to intensive care and intubations , but warned the increase of deaths is " sobering . " 
Fauci added , " Driving that and ahead of that is that fact that we are going to start to see the beginning of a turnaround , so we need to keep pushing on the mitigation strategies , because there is no doubt that ’s having a positive impact on the dynamics of the outbreak . " 
" As we get further on , beyond this week , we should start to see a turnaround which is a good sign , " he added .
