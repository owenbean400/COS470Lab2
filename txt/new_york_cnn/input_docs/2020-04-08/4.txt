The US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) announced a $ 489.4 million contract with General Motors ( GM ) to produce 30,000 ventilators under the Defense Production Act The ventilators will be delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile by the end of August with a production schedule allowing for the delivery of 6,132 ventilators by June 1 , according to a press release . 
HHS said the move follows President Trump ’s direction to HHS Secretary Alex Azar to invoke the Defense Production Act -- which was passed in 1950 in response to production needs during the Korean War -- with regard to GM ’s production of ventilators on March 27 . 
By using the Defense Production Act , Azar said HHS is " helping manufacturers like GM get the supplies they need to produce ventilators as quickly as possible , while also ensuring that these ventilators are routed through the Strategic National Stockpile to where they ’re needed most . " 
" The Trump Administration has deployed thousands of ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile that have helped save lives in hotspots such as New York so far , " he said . 
" We ’re grateful to the GM team for working with the federal government to expand our nation ’s supply of ventilators as the pandemic evolves . "
