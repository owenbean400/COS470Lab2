Jet Blue appears to be the first US airline to use new rules finalized yesterday that allow airlines operating at multiple airports in the same city to cut back on flights . 
The rules : The Department of Transportation rules allow airlines serving multiple airports in the same geographical area to consolidate service at a single airport . 
That allows airlines to cut back on duplicative ground operations — such as customer service agents and restocking planes — while remaining eligible for federal stimulus funds . 
To receive the funds , an airline must continue to provide at least one flight each week to the areas they currently serve . 
Jet Blue will use that approach in five of its markets : In Washington , DC , Jet Blue will suspend operations at the Baltimore Washington , and operate flights only from Reagan National . 
In the New York City , Jet Blue will use two New York area airports – Newark and JFK – and suspend operations at La Guardia , Westchester County and Stewart . 
In the Boston area , the airline will continue operations at Logan International and suspend operations at Providence 's T . F . Green International Airport ( PVD ) Around Los Angeles , flights will still take off from LAX and Long Beach , but service will stop at Hollywood Burbank and Ontario International . 
And around San Francisco , Jet Blue will operate at San Francisco International , but not San Jose . 
The airline said it would apply for waivers that would allow it to stop flying into other airports with very limited passengers . 
Other airlines are expected to make similar announcements . 
Jet Blue has cut its schedule by about 80 % .
