Friday is day 104 of the Covid 19 crisis and the numbers are going down , with 42 deaths related to Covid 19 on Thursday , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said . 
Cuomo also said the state has the lowest rate of transmission saying , " the virus is spreading at the lowest rate of transmission in the state of New York of every state in America , that is incredible . " 
He went on to say , " we were the number one state in terms of infection , number one in the nation , number one on the globe , per capita , and now we are the last state in terms of rate of transmission , that is because New Yorkers stepped up , they were smart they were disciplined they did what they had to do and we need to stay there . " 
Citing US states that have seen elevated numbers in coronavirus cases , the governor called it a " pivotal moment " in making sure this does not happen to New York . 
" This is deja vu , " Cuomo said . 
" They reopen and then the number goes up , which is common sense on one level . "
