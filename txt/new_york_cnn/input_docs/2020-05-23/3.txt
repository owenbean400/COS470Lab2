New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the Mid Hudson region , which includes Westchester County , has recorded a decline in the number of coronavirus related deaths and is closer to reopening . 
The only outstanding issue is that tracers must be trained , Cuomo said today during a news briefing . 
The region needs to train 857 contact tracers and if they do this , they can reopen on Tuesday , the governor said . 
The number of deaths have also dropped on Long Island and if that continues , and the contact tracing comes online , " we could open by Wednesday , " Cuomo said .
