New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo discussed the order he signed allowing gatherings of up to 10 people with appropriate mitigation and whether it would affect the infection rate in the state and its ability to reopen . 
" You can have a safe gathering of 10 people , you can also have a wholly unsafe gathering of 10 people , " the governor added . 
Cuomo was also asked about a lawsuit filed by the NYCLU Friday which essentially asked for expansion of the original order which was first extended to Memorial Day gatherings and religious services . 
" Having recognized that small events now can take place safely , the government does not get to pick who gets to exercise First Amendment rights , " Christopher Dunn , legal director at the NYCLU and lead counsel on the case , said in a news release . 
Cuomo responded , " I did not even know about a lawsuit on this one . "
