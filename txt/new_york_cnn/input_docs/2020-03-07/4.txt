The coronavirus is impacting the operations of some federal courts across the US . 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , which hears cases from nine western states including Washington , as well as a district court in Washington state , which has seen at least 80 cases , have altered some of the procedures as the virus continues to spread . 
The appeals court , which has four courthouses including one in Seattle , said it is cancelling all hearings involving multiple judges as well as non case related meetings , scheduled for next week . 
The court said in an order posted online it was taking this measure " in light of the concerns about community spread of the COVID 19 virus throughout " the region covered by it . 
All scheduled oral arguments in all locations will go forward , the court said . 
" Counsel who wish to appear remotely for any hearing may file a motion in that case for such relief , " the court said . 
The appeals court said it would be assessing the situation early next week . 
The Southern District of New York issued an order directing the Metropolitan Detention Center to screen all detainees prior to scheduled appearances at court . 
" If the temperature is 100.4 or above , such detainees should not be produced and the Court , forthwith , be notified , " Chief US District Judge Colleen Mc Mahon ordered Friday .
