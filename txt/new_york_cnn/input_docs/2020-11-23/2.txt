Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said he does not necessarily agree with states – such as New York and California – reviewing Covid 19 vaccine data for safety and efficacy on their own . 
Fauci added that the nation 's review process for vaccine development remains thorough . 
" The process really is a sound process , " he said . 
" Hopefully , I can appeal to them to say , yes , you can look at the data – but everybody should be looking at the data , there 's nothing wrong with that — but trust the process , " he said about the states . 
" Because it 's a sound process . "
