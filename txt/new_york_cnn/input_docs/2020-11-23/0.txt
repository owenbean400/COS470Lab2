New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reiterated that he believes the city is heading toward the " orange zone " designation based on the trajectory of the state ’s numbers , and outlined his initial plan for bringing schools back online . 
In the orange zone , indoor dining and gyms will be closed . 
Remember : New York City closed down its public school buildings starting last Thursday after the city 's seven day average reached the 3 % positive testing rate threshold . 
All students transitioned to remote learning . 
The mayor said there is a " strong strong likelihood that in a matter of days the state of New York will determine that NYC is an orange zone according to state standards . " 
De Blasio stressed that he is not speaking for the state but is taking the trajectory of their numbers and analyzing them , adding " basing on what the state has said already there ’s a likelihood as soon as next week even that NYC will be declared and orange zones . " 
" Once that happens we will be in a position to take additional measures to reopen schools , " he said . 
The clear protocol for that involves a lot more testing he said , and a very " aggressive " approach , he said . 
Testing would be done in advance of children and staff returning to school on top of much more testing throughout the school year . 
A lot of details have to be worked out between the city and state he said . 
The first focus will be special education , or district 75 schools , followed by youngest grades including early childhood education and then elementary . 
He did not elaborate further on the plan .
