New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that widespread vaccinations in the city would likely not be completed until roughly June 2021 and that residents should keep to basic Covid 19 precautions until then . 
The city will begin a communications campaign to publicize information about the vaccine on social media , on the subways , and on TV and radio , de Blasio said . 
Approximately 25,000 Moderna vaccine doses have arrived in New York City , according to Dr . Dave Chokshi , the city ’s health commissioner . 
The city is expecting about 149,000 Moderna doses in total this week , Chokshi said . 
De Blasio continued to urge New Yorkers to cancel their travel plans as Covid 19 case counts and hospitalizations continue to rise , but would not say whether the state was waiting too long on whether to institute another shutdown , calling the situation " complex . " 
Note : These numbers were released by the city of New York , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
