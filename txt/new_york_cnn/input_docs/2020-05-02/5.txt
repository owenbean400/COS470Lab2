Espaillat wrote a letter addressed to Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo and New York State Attorney General Letitia James calling for an investigation into nursing home facilities . 
The 705 bed geriatric center said that as the virus hit its facility , they did not have access to testing to " quickly diagnose " residents and staff , according to a statement . 
The center noted that they are getting more access to testing and that they have reported accurate data to the Department of Health .
