New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo disagrees with people who want to open the economy while the pandemic persists because he refuses to " put dollar signs over human lives . " 
Cuomo said that while he understands people have a first amendment right to express their disagreement with his decisions , he said they " have no right to jeopardize my health . " 
The state will continue to enforce the order that requires New York residents to wear a mask in public when they are unable to social distance . 
" The mask is not about your health . 
The mask is about my health and my children 's health and your children 's health –– and that 's why you have to wear a mask , " he said . 
" I believe it should be enforced because it 's reckless , it 's irresponsible and it 's not about your lives , it 's about other people 's lives and you do not have a right to do that . " 
On antibody testing : Of the 15,000 people tested for Covid 19 antibodies , 12.3 % of them have tested positive , Cuomo said . 
As of May 1 , New York City is seeing nearly 20 % of the positive cases with the borough of the Bronx seeing the highest percentage according to the governor . 
Cuomo went on to announce they are doing antibody testing for transit workers in the New York City region .
