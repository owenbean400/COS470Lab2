New York has been testing residents for Covid 19 antibodies at grocery stores , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo 's office said Saturday . 
The survey developed a baseline infection rate by testing 15,000 people at grocery stores and community centers across the state over the past two weeks , the governor ’s office said , adding that the study shows 12.3 % of the population have Covid 19 . 
Rudy Fuertes , the president of Fteley Food Corp , told CNN that antibody testing had occurred at two of his Fine Fare grocery stores in the Bronx , and at one Key Food location in Brooklyn . 
He said about 200 people , including patrons and workers , were tested at the locations over several days . 
" The communities we serve , they ’re very vulnerable . 
They ’re less fortunate . 
They want to go back to work . 
They ’re running out of money , " Fuertes said . 
Testing involved a dedicated line and room for taking blood samples , according to Fuertes . 
He was contacted by the state about the pilot program of testing in the grocery stores and said he was more than happy to accommodate . 
About 62 employees collectively at the 3 locations were tested for antibodies , including Fuertes who said he tested positive " I think it was a great initiative from the governor to bring hope to the community , " Fuertes said of the antibody testing . 
He also said he noticed an uptick in the number of individuals cashing in recyclables for money . 
" That tells me people are running out of money . 
People are desperate . 
They ’re cashing anything they can to buy food , " Fuertes said .
