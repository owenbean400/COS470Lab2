Hospitals in New York will now ask patients specific demographic questions to try and figure out where new coronavirus cases are coming from , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference Saturday . 
He said there has been about 900 new infections a day across the state . 
He said hospital workers will ask new patients about what community they live in within the boroughs , as well as their occupation and how they travel . 
" Are these infections that are being spread in the home ? 
Or are they front line workers , which means they 're getting up every day , they 're getting on public transit , they 're going to work and maybe they 're getting it on public transit , maybe they 're getting it at the work place , " Cuomo said . 
The governor said this data will be collected over the next few days .
