New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday the state will be focusing on a three part plan in regards to the Covid 19 vaccine , including education , equitable distribution and a fast delivery process . 
Step one : Education The state will be launching a public education plan to encourage residents to get the vaccine . 
For the vaccine to be effective , 75-85 % of the population needs to get it . 
Right now , 50 % of the population is saying they do not want to get it , according to the governor . 
The campaign will focus on a " real public education to dispel the skepticism that already exists , " he said . 
Step two : Equal distribution Secondly , the state will be focusing on equitable distribution of the vaccine in Black and brown communities , since these communities have been impacted by higher infection and death rates , Cuomo said . 
" We want to make sure that when we do the vaccine that it is done in a just and fair and equal way , " Cuomo told reporters . 
Step three : Speed of distribution Lastly , Cuomo said that the state is working on how to quickly distribute the vaccine across the state , which he said is a huge undertaking . 
" I ca not think of a government operation that has been commenced that is more difficult and intricate than what governments will be asked to do here , " he said . 
While the state has a good record of tackling challenges like testing capacity , this will " test capacity across the board , " he added .
