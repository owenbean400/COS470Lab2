Contracts range from 4 to 13 weeks , nurse Laura Liffiton explained . 
She ’s been in New York , Arizona and Wisconsin over the past few months . 
She said that she ’ll never forget the patients she has treated . 
Morgan Fitzsimmons , a traveling nurse also currently in Wisconsin , said that right now is " probably the most exposure that I 've had to Covid positive patients in the ER since everything has kind of begun . " 
She said she treats patients like they are her own family . 
" Everyone is a loved one . 
Whether this is a pandemic or this is before or after , we 're in this to help people . 
And I would like the best care for my parents … So I would like to be able to provide that for people and their family members when they 're feeling their worst , " she said .
