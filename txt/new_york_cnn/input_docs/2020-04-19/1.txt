CNN correspondent Nick Valencia said on CNN 's " The Color of Covid " special that Hispanic Americans are suffering the most in New York City , where the community makes up more than a third of virus related deaths . 
Social economic factors and inequality is at play . 
In New York , 34 % of the death rate is made up by Latinos , " and that is not even counting undocumented immigrants who may be afraid are showing symptoms are sick and are free to go into the doctor , " Valencia said . 
The jobs that Latino 's have may put the community more at risk of contracting the coronavirus . 
In New York , there are at least 242,424 coronavirus cases and 17,627 deaths .
