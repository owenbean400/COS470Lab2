New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the number of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations is " purely contingent on what we do " and reopening the economy too quickly without a specific plan could cause the numbers to increase again . 
" We can control the beast . 
Yes , but the beast is still alive . 
We did not kill the beast –– and the beast can rise up again , " Cuomo added . 
On antibody testing : Cuomo said said the FDA has approved the state 's antibody tests . 
" Now that we have the approved test we ’re going to be rolling it out to do the largest survey of any state population that has been done , " he said . 
Cuomo said the state can conduct 2,000 antibody tests per day , or about 14,000 per week . 
He mentioned that while this sounds like a large number , it is only a small percentage of New York 's population of more than 19 million people . 
Cuomo said this is the first real statistical number on exactly " where we are as a population , " and will provide a true " baseline . " 
" We have not had hard data on where we are , " Cuomo said .
