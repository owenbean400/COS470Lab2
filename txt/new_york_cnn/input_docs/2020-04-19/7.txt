New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to work better with the New York Police Department on social distancing and monitoring the number of people that can be on each car . 
His comments Sunday came after he was asked about some city council members urging the governor to shut down the subways to help stop the spread of the coronavirus . 
The mayor also said he does not know another way people could get around if trains were shut down . 
MTA spokesman Shams Tarek released a statement Sunday saying " even with subway ridership down more than 90 percent , we are making it possible for doctors , nurses , first responders , grocery and pharmacy workers , and other essential personnel to get to work and save lives . " 
Tarek also said " MTA has led the nation in its efforts to protect its employees and customers , disinfecting its stations and full fleet of rolling stock and even breaking away from federal guidance and providing hundreds of thousands of masks to our heroic workforce before the CDC recommended it . "
