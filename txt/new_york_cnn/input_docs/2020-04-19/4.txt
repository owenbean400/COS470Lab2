Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said " this is only halftime " in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic in New York . 
The governor said at his daily press conference today that the battle has not been won yet and any plan to reopen the economy has to be based on data and testing . 
Cuomo said New York needs to learn from this experience and focus on rebuilding . 
Cuomo said the second phase of the state 's plan to reopen the economy will require New Yorkers to do no harm , be smarter and develop new testing and learn the lessons to build back better . 
Cuomo also thanked the 95,000 medical professionals from inside and outside the state that have helped with coronavirus response efforts , saying it reminds him of the help the state received after 9/11 . 
He said just as it did then , the support gives us " confidence " that " were not in it alone . " 
Cuomo has spoken to Massachusetts Gov . 
Charlie Baker and told him that if they have to scramble , New York is going to " be there for you . " 
New York has identified 400 ventilators to bring over to Massachusetts " on 24 hours notice " should they need it , Cuomo said .
