New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo continued to warn that the coronavirus pandemic will cause a huge strain on hospitals and health care facilities . 
Cuomo said the goal is to have a 1,000 bed overflow facility in each of the five New York City boroughs , plus Westchester , Rockland , Nassau and Suffolk counties . 
Right now , hospitals and health care facilities in the state have enough personal protective equipment for the " immediate future , " Cuomo said , but they are still looking around the country for ventilators . 
The state has approved the splitting of ventilators to allow one machine to serve two patients . 
Cuomo said they are also working on converting thousands of anesthesia machines into ventilators .
