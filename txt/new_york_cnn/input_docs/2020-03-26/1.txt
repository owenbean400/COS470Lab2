At New York City â€™s Bellevue Hospital , a makeshift morgue including tents and refrigerated trucks is being set up in preparation for what may be a surge in the need for autopsies . 
A similar plan was utilized after September 11 attacks . 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has a request from New York and other states for assistance in mortuary operations . 
New York City has longstanding contracts with companies to also provide refrigerated trucks to store bodies , but that plan has not been put in to effect just yet . 
If and when it is , those trucks would likely be stationed at various locations including makeshift hospitals such as the Javits Center .
