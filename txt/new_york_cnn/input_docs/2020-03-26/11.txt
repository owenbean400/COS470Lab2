With New York quickly becoming the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the US , health care workers in the state have been working nonstop . 
Knowing that these heroes would not have time to stop and grab a meal , one of New York 's most famous couples — Bill and Hillary Clinton — stepped in to help . 
On Wednesday evening , the Clintons sent over 400 pizzas to hospitals in Westchester County " as a small token of their appreciation for everything medical professionals are doing for their communities , " according to Angel Ureña , spokesperson for President Clinton . 
There were 80 pizzas delivered to St . John 's Riverside Hospital alone . 
" Thank you to the Clintons for pizza today at DOBBS FERRY ED ! 
Leaders like you will get us through this . 
So much gratitude thank you thank you thank you , " Angela Cirilli , the emergency medicine ultrasound director at St . John 's Riverside Hospital , said in a tweet .
