Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said New York 's greatest critical need is ventilators to treat " people who will have acute needs " and those " under respiratory distress " from coronavirus . 
He said the state has procured 7,000 , but needs at a minimum another 30,000 â€” and he needs them in 14 days . 
Ventilators will " make the difference between life and death " for some patients , Cuomo said . 
He said New York is " scouring the globe " for ventilators and has resorted to trying experimental procedure where they split the ventilators between two patients because " we have no alternative . " 
Cuomo said the only way we can obtain these ventilators is through the federal government . 
He went on to criticize President Trump for not enacting the Defense Production Act to ramp up the number of ventilators that can be made available to New York . 
To not use federal powers to get ventilators to New York is " inexplicable , " he said .
