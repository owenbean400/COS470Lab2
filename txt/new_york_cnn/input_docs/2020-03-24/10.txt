New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said federal coronavirus resources should be given to his state first and then be allocated to other states in the country . 
New York is the most in need , he said , as there are now 25,000 coronavirus cases . 
After the peak in New York passes , Cuomo says ventilators should be deployed to other states . 
" I will take personal responsibility for transporting the 20,000 ventilators anywhere in this country that they want once we are past our apex , " he says . 
" I 'll send ventilators , I 'll send health care workers , I 'll send our professionals who dealt with it and who know all around the country . 
And that 's how this should be done . "
