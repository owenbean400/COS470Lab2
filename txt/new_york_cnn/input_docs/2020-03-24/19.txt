A Georgia congressman is urging Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to temporarily ban exports of medical supplies related to coronavirus over concerns that private companies will send supplies to foreign countries instead of states seeking the same equipment . 
GOP Rep . 
Doug Collins sent a letter to Pompeo Tuesday saying that he has heard from state health officials that they are having trouble obtaining equipment because US companies are receiving an influx of European orders . 
Collins , who is running for Senate against fellow Republican Sen . 
Kelly Loeffler , said he wanted the US government to " provide clear guidance that all production of necessary medical supplies must first be sent to purchasers in the United States until domestic demand has been satisfied , " adding that other countries have imposed limits on exports of medical supplies , too . 
State officials across the country have warned about the difficulty of obtaining medical supplies , such as masks , gowns and ventilators , saying they are having to compete with other states , the federal government and foreign countries for orders . 
Several state officials , including New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo , have pressed President Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to obtain the supplies that states need .
