Vincent Asaro , a reputed mob boss and member of the Bonanno crime family , was granted compassionate release from a federal medical detention facility in Missouri over fear of the continued spread of Covid 19 . 
In a decision issued on Friday in the Eastern District of New York , Judge Allyne Ross ruled that Asaro 's " age , in combination with his deteriorating health , " constituted " an extraordinary and compelling reason for his release " during the pandemic . 
Ross wrote that , while there were no confirmed cases of Covid 19 in the prison where Asaro is being held , " absent more information about how much testing the BOP ( Federal Bureau of Prisons ) is conducting , it is possible that undetected cases are present in the facility . " 
Asaro pleaded guilty in 2017 to charges stemming from a 2012 incident in which he was alleged to have ordered a man 's car set on fire . 
He was sentenced to eight years in prison . 
He suffered a stroke in custody in 2019 , suffers from aphasia , and has difficulty walking , court documents state . 
Asaro was found not guilty in 2015 on charges that he participated in the infamous 1978 Lufthansa Heist at New York 's John F . Kennedy International Airport .
