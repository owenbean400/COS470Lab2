New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the state knows how to conduct testing and contact tracing , but the problem is how to do it on a widespread scale to ensure reopening the economy would not cause a spike in coronavirus infections . 
The testing supply chain : Cuomo explained that tests are made by private laboratory equipment manufacturers who then sell their tests to smaller labs . 
These smaller labs sell to hospitals and the public . 
In order for these tests to be performed , local labs must have necessary testing chemicals known as " reagents . " 
" They bought the machine . 
They have the machine . 
They have the test . 
But they need the reagents to do a higher volume of tests , " Cuomo said . 
Cuomo said the problem with getting more reagents hinges on them not being made in the US . 
Additionally , because these manufactures are regulated by the federal government , it controls where the reagents are distributed . 
" We need help on that supply chain , especially when it becomes international . 
And we need coordination and basic partnership , " Cuomo said . 
New York called the top 50 producing labs in the state and say " we could be doing more if they would give us the reagents , that ’s the log jam that we are in , " Cuomo said . 
The local labs have to go back to that manufacturer to run their tests , and " there ’s very little uniformity among the tests so your trying to coordinate this whole private sector system , " he said .
