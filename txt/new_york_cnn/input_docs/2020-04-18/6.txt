New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said today that nursing homes are privately run facilities and while the state has basic regulations , they do not get into fine details of what these facilities do and what the policy of communication is . 
" I do not know what else we could release beyond number of deaths per nursing home that does not violate healthcare privacy , " Cuomo said . 
If there is a complaint that a nursing home is non responsive " than we will talk to the nursing home and follow up , " he added . 
When asked if nursing homes were underreporting , Cuomo said " I do not know if that ’s what it is . " 
The governor has spoken to a number of nursing homes and " more than anything " they are overwhelmed and staff are getting sick . 
The residents are also under tremendous pressure because they have not had visitors , he said . 
He does not think anything is nefarious about reporting , but that it ’s just the dynamic . 
By the numbers : Yesterday the state released data showing there have been 1,109 confirmed Covid 19 deaths and presumed deaths from Covid 19 in 68 long term care nursing home facilities in New York . 
However , the state did not provide a breakdown of how many were " presumed " deaths but indicated the data would be separated in future updates . 
The data is also incomplete because , for " privacy purposes , " facilities with less than five deaths have been excluded from reporting the results , according to the state website .
