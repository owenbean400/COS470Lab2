The campaign includes digital signage across more than 7,000 digital screens –– including 4,000 in the NYC subway system , 2,600 on busses and about 550 on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro North Railroad . 
There are also an additional 7,000 printed signs and audio announcements across the system .
