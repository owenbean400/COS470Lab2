eate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized President Trump ’s latest coronavirus relief efforts as being " unworkable , weak , and far too narrow . " 
Only one of the actions signed by the President was an order – the rest were memoranda . 
Schumer specifically criticized the payroll tax deferral , saying he has already talked to companies who will continue withholding payroll taxes in case they will be forced to pay them when the deferral expires in December . 
" Employers are just going to continue , withhold the money – I have talked to some – because they do not want their employees to be stuck with a huge bill in December , " Schumer added . 
The Senator from New York also criticized the policy for depleting Medicare and Social Security funds . 
" If you 're a Social Security recipient or Medicare recipient , you better watch out if President Trump is re elected , " Schumer warned . 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on " Fox News Sunday " that there would be no cuts in benefits , because there will be an " automatic contribution from the general funds to those trust funds . "
