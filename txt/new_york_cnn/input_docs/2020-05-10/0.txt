The Doe Fund , a group know for aiding formerly incarcerated men to rejoin society , has moved about 300 men into a high end hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan , a spokesman for the organization told CNN . 
Bill Cunningham , the spokesman , said the city matched the organization with the hotel to follow social distancing protocols because their three housing facilities in Harlem and Brooklyn have dormitory style rooms housing about 10 men at a time . 
Two men will be assigned to a single room and meals will be delivered to the rooms three times per day . 
They will continue their work program jobs , including cleaning public spaces like bus shelters and mail boxes . 
They will be subject to the same security policies in the organization 's shelters , Cunningham said . 
About 7,000 people in need of shelter have been staying at hotels across the city , " enabling them to more effectively isolate while also increasing social distancing at the shelters from which they moved , " said Isaac Mc Ginn , a spokesman with the city 's Department of Social Services . 
The agency declined to discuss what hotels are being used to house New Yorkers in need of shelter . 
As of Friday , DSS had tracked 882 positive Covid 19 cases in their system and 73 deaths , Mc Ginn said . 
The Doe Fund had about 20 positive cases among its members since early March , but no Covid 19 related deaths thus far , Cunningham said .
