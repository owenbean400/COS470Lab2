Ridership on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York is down 90 % , interim MTA President Sarah Feinberg told CNN affiliate WABC TV on Sunday . 
This means that about 500,000 people are using the system each weekday , and even fewer on the weekends . 
Feinberg said more than 2,000 people are cleaning and disinfecting subways and stations over the course of 24 hours each day , including during a nightly shutdown . 
Feinberg said cleaning during the overnight hours " gives us the ability to really surge into the system , make sure that we 've gotten every train car , disinfect those stations for a second time , gives us that room where we can really make sure we 've gotten to everything . " 
She emphasized that the MTA has made a " surge " on bus service running additional express buses and enhanced local service in light of the overnight shutdown .
