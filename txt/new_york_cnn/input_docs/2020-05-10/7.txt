New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo warned that the federal government needs to have a plan in place that prioritizes getting American workers ' jobs back as big corporations start to reopen . 
Cuomo said the " government should not subsidize their reduction of employees " and suggested the Americans First Law as a possible solution . 
The law states that if a corporation does not rehire the same number of employees they had before the pandemic , they have to return any government money they received , Cuomo said .
