New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned today that a second wave of coronavirus is headed for the city , but said if New Yorkers practice proper social distancing the wave could still be stopped . 
" We have a second wave bearing down on us but we can stop that second wave , " he said , in response to a question from CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on whether or not he would shut down schools if more than 3 % of Covid 19 tests came back positive , as he promised to in the summer . 
The current positive rate over a seven day rolling period is 2.6 % . 
" We 've proven there 's a formula for beating this virus and getting the people fully engaged because when people decide they are going to change their behavior that 's when you beat back the virus , " said the mayor . 
De Blasio said New Yorkers could stop the second wave by refraining from holiday travel and large gatherings and by wearing masks .
