New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the " mass gatherings " of protesters " could in fact exacerbate the Covid 19 spread . " 
Speaking about the progress that the state has made against the coronavirus — going from 800 deaths per day to reopening in 50 days — Cuomo said , " do not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory . " 
However , Cuomo said its very hard to say to people not to come out because of the pandemic , because he does not want it to be misconstrued with the notion that protesters ' concerns are not valid or heard . 
" It ’s a very tough balance , " he said adding it is happening on an intense national scale and a the " outpouring of such pain and frustration . " 
Similarly , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier that there is a " real danger " that the protests could intensify the spread of the virus " just at a point where we ’re starting to beat it back profoundly . " 
" I am very worried about the health impact , " de Blasio said .
