Fatal cardiac arrests soared in the streets and homes of New York at the peak of the coronavirus epidemic there in March and April , researchers reported Friday . 
While coronavirus likely caused many of these deaths , others were probably a consequence of an overwhelmed medical system , the researchers reported in the journal JAMA Cardiology . 
They found a three fold increase in the number of people needing emergency resuscitation in 2020 as compared to the same time period last year . 
And 90 % of these people died , the team at Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Health System found . 
" Three fold is actually a conservative number because on April 6 it was a 10 fold increase , " Prezant told CNN . 
On that day in 2019 , EMTs responded to 30 out of hospital cardiac arrests . 
On April 6 , 2020 , there were 305 . 
For the whole time period of March and April , there were 3,989 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital in 2020 , compared to 1,336 in 2019 . 
That â€™s 2,653 more deaths in 2020 compared to 2019 . 
Prezant and colleagues analyzed the available information on these victims . 
They were mostly older , Black or Hispanic , and more likely to have diabetes or high blood pressure . 
Many were also physically frail , Prezant said . 
Plus , when EMTs arrived , they found that the patients had what are called non shockable arrhythmias . 
They could not be rescued by CPR or defibrillation . 
" The tragedy of the COVID 19 pandemic is not just the number of patients infected , but the large increase in out of hospital cardiac arrests and deaths , " Prezant and colleagues concluded . 
" This catastrophe transpired despite similar rates of bystander CPR , similar EMS response times , and similar durations of resuscitation efforts , compared with 2019 . "
