New York State could face a second shutdown if the current trajectory of Covid 19 metrics does not change , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference Monday . 
Cuomo said that the current trajectory shows that by January , there could be 11,000 patients in hospitals due to Covid 19 and an additional 3,500 dead . 
Cuomo identified Erie , Monroe , Central New York , and particularly New York City as areas of concerns . 
" New York City is different , there is more density , " Cuomo said . 
" We know how fast it takes off in New York City . " 
Addressing the concerns of business owners who are unhappy with current capacity rates , Cuomo said that people should be more worried about a shutdown if the current trajectory does not change . 
" We go back to where we were , all nonessential business closed , they go to zero . " 
Cuomo said . 
" Yes we are trying to change the trajectory , you should be happy , if we do not change the trajectory then we are going to close . " 
In order to avoid another shutdown , Cuomo said that two things need to be done : " It â€™s difficult to stop during the holiday season , " Cuomo said . 
" I think of it as a footrace between holiday spread and hospital capacity and vaccination critical mass . 
The problem is experts say vaccination for the critical mass is not for six to nine months . " 
Cuomo said New York state today conducted what he believes was the first vaccine administered in the United States . 
" We are in the process of administering 10,000 vaccinations today , " Cuomo said .
