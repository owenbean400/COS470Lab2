This week is a big test for the New York City public school system , the largest in the United States . 
After a chaotic couple of months , officials say they 're finally ready to invite students back into classrooms . 
Now they have to convince parents and teachers it 's safe . 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo announced August 7 that schools in the state could reopen classrooms for the fall . 
That was about a month before the scheduled start of the New York City school year . 
But Cuomo did not order schools to reopen -- he left that decision to local leaders . 
In New York City , that meant Mayor Bill de Blasio , schools commissioner Richard Carranza and a host of other involved parties like teachers ' union leaders and parents ' groups . 
It proved to be a huge challenge . 
First , the city announced schools would open to students on September 10 . 
That got delayed until September 21 . 
And then that date was delayed to September 29 , and the start of in person education was split into several dates . 
Kindergarten through eighth grade starts on Tuesday , while middle school and high school students have to wait until October 1 . 
And in person education is limited : a hybrid schedule keeps students in the classroom only a few days a week , with the rest of their learning online . 
It 's a complicated schedule , the result of political negotiations and ongoing concern about a new spread of Covid 19 in the city that was once the hardest hit in the United States .
