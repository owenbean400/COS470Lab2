President Trump raised questions on Sunday about why there is such a large demand for masks in hospitals and again charged there is some " hoarding " of ventilators , without providing any evidence or examples . 
Trump also questioned how New York hospitals are using masks so quickly , saying " something is going on and you ought to look into it as reporters . " 
He suggested that masks might be " going out the back door " of New York hospitals . 
What New York and hospitals say : New York state Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that there was a stockpile being built of ventilators because the state needed to be ready for what he thought was a larger outbreak yet to come . 
The American Hospital Association responded to the President â€™s charges , saying they have to make sure they are prepared for various future needs . 
Dr Celine Gounder , an infectious disease and global health expert , told CNN that the need for hundreds of thousands of masks was understandable .
