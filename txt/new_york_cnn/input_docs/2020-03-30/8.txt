New York City Fire Department paramedic Anthony Almojera said he has seen a lot on his job — but dealing with the coronavirus crisis has posed new challenges . 
He described how he tried to comfort a husband after his wife , who was a health care worker , died — but he could not touch the grieving man . 
" When people pass away , the grief component has to transfer , " he said . 
" Normally , I would put my arm around him but this time around , I had to keep distance and I watched this man ’s grief come over him , his anger , his sadness . 
We tried to comfort him from a distance because there ’s a high probability he has it and I have to be concerned for not only my safety but my crew ’s safety , " he said , adding that the husband was also a health care worker . 
He said that while his crew is vulnerable , they 're still working to help people . 
" I just want to say to everybody out there , if you call 911 , we ’ll be there , " he said .
