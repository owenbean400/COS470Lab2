President Trump said the Food and Drug Administration approved a machine that could disinfect N95 masks , so health care providers could reuse them . 
" Each machine now can disinfect 120,000 masks per day , " Trump said today . 
" Now , think of that . 
Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day . 
It will be just like a new one . 
It can go up to about 20 times for each mask . " 
He continued : " So each mask can go through this process 20 times . 
And they have two in Ohio , one in New York , and one will soon be shipped to Seattle , Washington . 
And also to Washington , DC . 
So that 's going to make a tremendous difference on the masks . " 
The FDA approved the use of the mask cleaning machine produced by Columbus based Battelle earlier Monday .
