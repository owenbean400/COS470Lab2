New York City 's Brookdale University Medical Center says that the massive number of patients they are seeing during the Covid 19 crisis is causing a strain on the number of oxygen tanks available . 
Brookdale 's vice president of external affairs Khari Edwards confirmed to CNN they are short but could not say how short they are . 
A respiratory therapist at the hospital in Brooklyn tells CNN that the number of patients requiring oxygen has increased so dramatically that they have used nearly all their oxygen tanks , including about 50 % of the emergency reserves . 
The respiratory therapist says that they are expecting a shipment on Monday morning to fully replenish their supply and the reserves . 
Now , instead of having nearly 130 tanks delivered twice a week , the respiratory therapist says the hospital is trying to get oxygen tank deliveries daily . 
They say they 'll also be increasing the size of the deliveries until the crisis is over . 
The amount of time an oxygen tank lasts depends on its size and the oxygen concentration a patient needs , according to the respiratory therapist . 
New York state has the highest number of confirmed cases of any state in the US , with at least 59,513 infections and 965 deaths , according to CNN 's tally .
