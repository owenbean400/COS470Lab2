For the first time in its history , New York City â€™s entire subway system is scheduled to be closed Wednesday morning . 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) is starting a deep cleaning to avoid spread of the coronavirus . 
The cleanings will be done on a nightly basis , starting from 1 a.m . to 5 a.m . Wednesday . 
When the cleaning is done , every single subway car will be disinfected . 
" This is critical to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers , " said Foye . 
To accommodate the loss of train service , the MTA is adding several hundred buses to its typical overnight routes to make sure essential workers have access to transportation . 
Subway officials warned New York residents that there may be hiccups in executing the unprecedented closure . 
" If this were a normal moment , we would have planned this for months , " New York City Transit President Sarah Feinberg said .
