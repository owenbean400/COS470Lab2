New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the state is adding three new states to its quarantine list : Delaware , Kansas and Oklahoma . 
That means that travelers from 19 states are required to quarantine for two weeks after they enter New York , Cuomo said . 
New Jersey and Connecticut are also requiring travelers from those 19 states to quarantine . 
After touting low hospitalization and intubation rates in the state , Cuomo said he also had some " bad news " to share . 
" Bad news is everything around us , frankly , " Cuomo said , noting that a virus " anywhere " means it 's a threat everywhere . 
Cuomo said that people flying to New York from the 19 states on the quarantine list will be given a form on their flights asking them to report where they 're coming from , where they 're staying and informing them of the need to quarantine .
