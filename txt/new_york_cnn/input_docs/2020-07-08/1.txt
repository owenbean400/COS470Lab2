New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday that if schools reopen in the fall , the approach will be " blended learning " — meaning " at some points in the week , you 're learning in person in the classroom ; at other points of the week , you ’re learning remotely . " 
Remember : New York state has not decided if schools will be open in September but has asked each of the 700 districts to come up with a plan .
