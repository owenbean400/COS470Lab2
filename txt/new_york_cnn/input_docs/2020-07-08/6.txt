New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy said the state reported 335 new Covid 19 cases , bringing its total to more than 174,000 . 
The daily positivity rate for tests recorded on Monday is 3.23 % , Murphy said , even though the state has been hovering at about 2 % . 
The number of tests counted Monday was very low , which may account for the increase , Murphy said . 
The governor added that there have been " a couple flare ups " related to out of state travel . 
" There ’s another increment of risk we ’re getting from folks coming in from other states that have exploded and continue to explode , " he said . 
He added that the system " so far so good has worked spotting some of these flare ups relating to out of state travel , as well as some knucklehead behavior in state . " 
Remember : New Jersey , along with New York and Connecticut , require travelers coming from at least 19 states with high coronavirus rates to quarantine for at least two weeks once they enter the state .
