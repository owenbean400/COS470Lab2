US stocks inched up at the opening bell in New York , but it 's a rather quiet day on Wall Street . 
After Tuesday â€™s losses , no new records are on the horizon on Wednesday . 
And with the second quarter earnings season not properly starting until next week , and little data on the economic calendar , stocks are lacking an obvious catalyst . 
In recent sessions , a quiet news day has meant that investors worried about rising Covid 19 infections across America . 
Here 's how the market opened : The Dow opened 0.2 % , or 62 points , higher . 
The S&P 500 kicked off 0.3 % higher . 
The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 % .
