As the coronavirus continues to spread across the US , schools and universities are starting to end semesters early or conduct classes online instead of in person . 
Multiple schools are doing so in Washington state , which has been hardest hit in the nation . 
In New York , Columbia University , New York University , Fordham University , and Barnard College have all announced they will start conducting online classes . 
Amherst College has decided to end the semester entirely -- classes are canceled this Thursday and Friday , and the university has decreed no students are allowed on campus after March 16 . 
Remote learning will continue after spring break , beginning March 23 . 
West Coast schools are also taking action -- Stanford , the University of Southern California , and UC San Diego have announced remote learning measures . 
Brown University , in Rhode Island , has not cancelled classes -- but is taking other measures like canceling all events that have 100 or more attendees .
