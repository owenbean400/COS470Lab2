New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said a containment area will be set up in the city of New Rochelle as Westchester County works to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
Schools and facilities within will be closed for two weeks , and the National Guard will deploy to this area to help support the community . 
Health Commissioner Dr . Howard Zucker said the area is a circle with a radius of about one mile . 
Starting on Thursday , facilities and schools within the area will be closed for two weeks . 
The National Guard will help deliver food to homes and clean public spaces in the containment area , Cuomo said , describing the plan as a " dramatic action . " 
This will go on through March 25 . 
Cuomo described it as a " matter of life and death . " 
New York is also setting up a satellite testing facility , partnering with Northwell Health , in New Rochelle , which is in Westchester County . 
New Rochelle is " a particular problem , " Cuomo said , adding that " the numbers have been going up , the numbers continue to go up , the numbers are going up unabated . " 
Cuomo stressed the shutting facilities in the area is a " dramatic action " that applies to " large congregate facilities for gatherings , " including schools and temples , but not " everything . "
