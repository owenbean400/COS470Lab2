Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , provided an update — and a warning — on the novel coronavirus at the White House Tuesday . 
As of this morning , he said , there are 712 confirmed cases in the US with 27 deaths . 
" By this evening , that ’s going to be up . 
The question is , what are we going to do about that ? " he said . 
Fauci said there are a number of things that can be done to " interfere with the natural flow " of an outbreak such that it infects less people , leading to less deaths . 
" If and when the infections will come — and they will come , sorry to say , sad to say — when you ’re dealing with an infectious disease … we want to be where the infection is going to be , as well as where it is , " Fauci said . 
Everyone should be taking those precautions , he said , " whether you live in the zone that has community spread or not . " 
" Everybody should say , ‘ all hands on deck , ’ " he said . 
Americans who live in places with community spread , according Fauci , should ratchet up those mitigations . 
That includes the states of Washington , California , New York , and Florida .
