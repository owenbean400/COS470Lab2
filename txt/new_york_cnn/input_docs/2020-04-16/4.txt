New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo laid out coordinated steps to " unpause " the state 's economy at a press conference today . 
He said this effort spans from now to when there is vaccine for coronavirus . 
Cuomo said the first step is to " do no harm . " 
Second , the state will need to strengthen the health care system . 
Cuomo said because every hospital had to increase capacity by 50 % to handle the surge of coronavirus patients , it is important to ensure they have the resources to recover . 
" Now we have a chance to be more intelligent , frankly , about handling our health care system , " he said . 
Reopening the economy will also need widespread testing and contact tracing –– something Cuomo said the federal government needs to help with . 
Cuomo also outlined a plan for a phased return to " normal " and reopening of businesses and schools slowly and in coordination with each other . 
" You stopped everything . 
How do you then restart that machine in a coordinated way that does not drive up the infection rate ? 
That 's the balance that we 're trying to strike , " Cuomo said .
