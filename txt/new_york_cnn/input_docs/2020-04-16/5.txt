Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo says New York has gotten control of the spread of coronavirus in the state . 
Cuomo discussed infection rate models shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention early on during the pandemic and how they have not come to fruition . 
" If their rate of spread actually happened , we would have been in a much , much worse situation and we would have been in a really bad place . 
I mean their projections were staggering and it did not happen because we slowed the models , " he said .
