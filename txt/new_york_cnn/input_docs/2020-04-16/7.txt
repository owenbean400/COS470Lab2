New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo responded to a question about those criticizing his order to require New Yorkers to wear masks in public as a symbol of government control saying , " To them I say , if you do not think 600 people died yesterday and if you do not think that 's a problem , I disagree with you . " 
Earlier in the news conference Cuomo announced 606 people died in the state on Wednesday . 
That is down from 752 people across the state who died the day before . 
He said that while he understands the opposition , there is a personal responsibility to protect other people if you are sick . 
" If you have the virus , you can infect other people . 
And you have a liability of responsibility not to infect me because you are sick . 
That 's when a mask would help , " Cuomo said . 
About the executive order : Starting on Friday , people — 2 years old and older — must wear a mask or cloth over their nose and mouth when riding on public transportation systems , private transportation carriers and for hire vehicles , Cuomo said . 
Operators of public systems , private carriers , and for hire vehicles must wear a mask at all times , he added .
