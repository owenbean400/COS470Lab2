A major New York hospital network has given high doses of an over the counter heartburn drug to patients with Covid 19 to see if it works against the coronavirus . 
The study of famotidine -- the active ingredient in Pepcid -- started April 7 , and preliminary results could come in a few weeks , said Dr . Kevin Tracey , president of Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health , which runs 23 hospitals in the New York City area . 
The patients are receiving the drug intravenously at doses about nine times higher than what people take orally for heartburn . 
So far , 187 patients have been enrolled in the clinical trial , and Northwell eventually hopes to enroll 1,200 , Tracey said . 
Tracey and his colleagues got the idea to study famotidine after it was observed that some patients in China taking the drug fared better than patients not taking the drug . 
Tracey said in addition to the observation in Chinese patients , in a review by Florida based Alchem Laboratories of existing drugs that might fight coronavirus , famotidine showed up at the top of the list . 
The famotidine study was first reported in Science Magazine .
