New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo outlined the state 's phased reopening at a news conference Sunday saying it will be important to base the strategy on a " regional analysis . " 
" Look at the regional analysis . 
Make a determination . 
And then monitor whatever you do , " he said about the plan . 
The phases are : Phase 1 : Construction and manufacturing activities – and within that " those businesses that have a low risk " Cuomo said . 
Phase 2 : More of a business by business analysis – using a matrix that determines how essential a service that business provides and how " risky " is that business and how " important " is it for that business to reopen . 
Cuomo said the second phase is " going to be up to businesses . " 
Business have to do the matrix analysis themselves to determine how risky it would be for them to reopen , and then outline how they will put safety precautions in place , the governor added . 
There will be two weeks in between the phases to monitor the effects and determine the next steps , the governor said .
