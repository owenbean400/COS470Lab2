New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said when it comes to moving forward , and thinking of solutions to problems , everyone should question why we do things the way we do . 
He said implementing new ways to safely reopen the economy will require making changes at a societal level . 
" People do not like change , " Cuomo said . 
" We like control more than anything , right .

It 's hard to make change . 
It 's hard to make change in your own life let alone on a societal collective level . "

And if you do not run the risk of change , you do not have the benefit of advancement . "
