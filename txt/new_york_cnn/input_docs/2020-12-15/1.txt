New York physician Dr . Yves Duroseau , one of the first health care workers to get the Covid 19 vaccine in the US , said he received the vaccine on live television yesterday because he thinks it ’s important to be a role model for others . 
Duroseau , the chair of emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital , said he was sending a message as both a leader and physician who has seen patients suffer from Covid 19 , as well as to " communities who are maybe reluctant to take the vaccination . " 
Just 20 % of Black Americans and 26 % of Hispanics said they wanted a coronavirus vaccine right away , according to a survey out today from the Kaiser Family Foundation . 
Duroseau said a " silver lining " of the pandemic is that the country is having a conversation about health care disparities . 
He said he ’s feeling " great " nearly 24 hours after getting the vaccine . 
As someone who lost a family member to the virus , he warned people to not let up on social distancing measures and other guidelines .
