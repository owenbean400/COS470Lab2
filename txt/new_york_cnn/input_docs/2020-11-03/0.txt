New York City 's seven day average of new coronavirus cases is " cause for concern , " Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday . 
The city recorded 605 new cases on a seven day average . 
" We are watching that very carefully , " de Blasio said . 
" Some of that again is because of a lot more testing , but it 's still cause for concern . " 
The daily number of people admitted to hospital with Covid 19 in New York City is at 83 . 
Meanwhile , the percentage of people who tested positive for Covid 19 across the city is " clearly aberrant " at 0.38 % , Mayor de Blasio said . 
" We 've seen that from time to time when surprisingly low number of test results have come in for the day . 
That can vary by day , that number will change and go upwards as more test results come in , " said de Blasio , adding that the truest number is the 7 day rolling average , which is at 1.59 % . 
New York -- once the epicenter of the pandemic as the largest and densest city in the US -- began gradually reopening in June . 
In total , New York City has recorded 256,881 coronavirus cases , 19,355 confirmed deaths and 4,662 " probable deaths " related to Covid 19 , according to figures released Monday by the city 's public health agency .
