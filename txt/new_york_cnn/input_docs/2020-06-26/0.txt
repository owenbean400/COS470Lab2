Microsoft founder Bill Gates dismissed the White House 's claim that an increase in case numbers is a direct result of an increase in testing , calling it " completely false . " 
Local officials , he said , have " gotten their act together on testing . " 
Gates said testing capacity will continue to increase in the fall , and " that 's good news . " 
" But that 's not the reason we 're seeing these case increases , " he said . 
" If you take the New York or the New York area out , in fact we 're still very much in the thick of things . "
