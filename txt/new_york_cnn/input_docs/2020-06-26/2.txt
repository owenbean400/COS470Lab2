Scientific evidence suggests that wearing a face mask can help stop the spread of Covid 19 . 
New polling confirms that some regions of the US are taking that message to heart more than others . 
Specifically , residents of the Northeast ( led by New York ) said they 're wearing masks at a significantly greater rate than the majority of the country . 
That 's the finding of an aggregation of more than 6,000 respondents from Ipsos Knowledge Panel polling done for Axios ( Axios/Ipsos poll ) . 
Over the last month and a half ( May 8 to June 22 ) , a fairly stable 48 % to 51 % of Americans told the pollster that they wore masks at all times when leaving home . 
Other pollsters , who have asked analogous questions during the same period , have shown similar numbers overall . 
In the Axios/Ipsos polling , you can clearly see how much ahead of the curve New York ( among the 28 states for which we had at least 75 respondents ) and the Mid Atlantic ( see here for all Census division subsets ) portion of the Northeast are when it comes to mask wearing . 
Of the over 750 Mid Atlantic respondents , 64 % say they are always wearing masks when they go out . 
As Ipsos did in a recent poll with the Washington Post , they were able to drill down to the state level in some instances too . 
In New York , 67 % say they 're wearing a mask at all times when they leave their house . 
That 's the highest percentage for any state for which there were at least 75 respondents polled .
