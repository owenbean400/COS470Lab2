Drugs often used to combat HIV and AIDS are being used to treat patients of the Wuhan coronavirus in Beijing , the city â€™s Health Commission said in a statement . 
Three designated hospitals are using the drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir to treat patients as part of a test program titled " Pneumonitis Diagnosis and Treatment Program for New Coronavirus Infection ( Trial Edition ) . " 
Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health told CNN there are currently no proven effective drugs to treat this virus . 
The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus but it would take a few months until the first phase of the clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available , Fauci said . 
A team of scientists in Texas , New York and China are also at work on a vaccine , according to Dr . Peter Hotez , a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston .
