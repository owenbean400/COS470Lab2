New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo reacted to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio closing the city ’s schools on a radio interview on WAMC , saying the mayor was " within his prerogative " but that he would have preferred to keep schools open . 
On one hand , he says de Blasio was " totally within his prerogative " for closing the schools because he set a 3 % Covid 19 city positivity rate as a threshold for closing schools . 
Cuomo emphasized that he does not feel de Blasio closing schools was a mistake . 
But he says his preference would have been to keep schools open . 
" Schools right now are safer than kids on the street in a high infection community , " Cuomo said . 
" The schools often have a lower infection rate than the surrounding community . 
So , my preference is always to keep the schools open , unless there was a high infection rate -- which there ’s not . " 
Cuomo said at the time de Blasio set the 3 % infection rate as a threshold for closing schools , it seemed " reasonable . " 
But now , he advises New York City to re confer with parents and adjust the threshold . 
" When he set the 3 ( percent positivity rate threshold ) it sounded fine , " Cuomo said . 
" In retrospect , it turned out that it was low . "
