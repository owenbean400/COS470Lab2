New York officials say that Hart Island , which for decades has been used as the final resting place for those who died unclaimed , will now also be used for unclaimed coronavirus victims . 
" It is likely that people who have passed away from ( coronavirus ) . . . . will be buried on the island in the coming days , " New York City Mayor Press Secretary Freddi Goldstein told CNN . 
Drone pictures on Thursday showed bodies being buried on the island . 
The move comes as New York continues to respond to its devastating coronavirus outbreak . 
More than 161,000 cases and 7,067 deaths have been reported in the state , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Hart Island has been used by the city as a public cemetery for over 150 years and is managed by the Department of Corrections . 
The Hart island burials are mostly people who have been unclaimed at the city 's morgue for anywhere from 30 to 60 days , Goldstein said . 
Over one million people are interred there . 
The city is transferring unclaimed bodies to Hart Island to make way for other coronavirus victims whose bodies will be claimed , Goldstein said . 
New rules from the medical examiner 's office say bodies will be taken to the island if they go unclaimed for two weeks . 
Only people who have not been claimed by relatives or a loved will be buried there , Goldstein highlighted . 
Despite the new rule from the medical examiner , Goldstein said as long as morgue officials make contact with a relative within 14 days , they will not be moved to Hart Island . 
" These are people who , for two weeks , we have not been able to find anyone who says ' I know that person I love that person I will handle the burial , ' " Goldstein said . 
" These are people who we have made zero contact with the family . " 
Usually , about 25 people are buried on the island each week , Goldstein said . 
But since coronavirus began claiming victims in the US , she said there are 25 people buried there each day .
