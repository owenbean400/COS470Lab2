Secretary of Defense Mark Esper says the military is sending another 300 medical personnel to help New York City hospitals . 
Appearing on CBS " This Morning " Esper said , " we 've deployed to 11 New York City hospitals 350 doctors , nurses and respiratory therapists and today we will be deploying another 300 to help those local hospital workers who 've been struggling mightily to keep on top of the ( coronavirus ) cases help them out provide them some additional relief from the Department of Defense " . 
CNN reported earlier this week that Do D would be " flooding the area with medical teams . " 
The Pentagon said Tuesday that 325 military medical personnel have arrived in New York and would start embedding in 11 public hospitals on Wednesday . 
The deployment of military medical personnel directly to hospitals represents a recent change in tactics for the Defense Department . 
At first the military wanted to transfer equipment to the civilians and stay largely out of the way . 
Then it agreed to do overflow and non coronavirus patients , then coronavirus overflow and now hundreds of military doctors are surging on the frontlines in New York area hospitals .
