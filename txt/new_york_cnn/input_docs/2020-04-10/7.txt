New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said while New York is flattening the coronavirus curve overall , the current trajectory depends on people keeping social distancing guidelines . 
" There is no natural trajectory . 
The trajectory is the trajectory that we create by our actions . 
The natural trajectory would see that line continue to go up , " he said in his daily news briefing . 
Cuomo stressed that " we have to stay the course " to keep slowing the spread of coronavirus . 
Cuomo said that the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus made projection models difficult to determine , and in turn , hard to put policies in place based on those models . 
" None of these projections were in any way comforting to us . 
The actual curve is much , much lower than any of them projected , " he said .
