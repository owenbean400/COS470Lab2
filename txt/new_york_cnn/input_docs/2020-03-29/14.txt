A nurse at Elmhurst Hospital in New York described to CNN how quickly patients are deteriorating in their hospital . 
Desaturate refers to a patient 's oxygen saturation levels dropping to unsafe and , in this case , fatal levels . 
The nurse said they watched , completely helpless , with two doctors alongside , as patients died from coronavirus complications . 
" Even though you restart the heart , they cannot breathe and before you get a minute to process the life lost , they come and snatch the ventilator , " the nurse said . 
" And ( then ) another patient is crashing . " 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo addressed the stresses this particular hospital is experiencing during his daily press conference . 
Last week , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Elmhurst had been the hospital hit hardest by the surge in cases and more medical personnel were being sent there . 
CNN previously reported that 13 patients died at the hospital from coronavirus within 24 hours last week .
