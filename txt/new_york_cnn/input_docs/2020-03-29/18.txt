Amazon employees at the company ’s facility in Staten Island , New York , plan to walk off the job Monday amid allegations the online retail giant has mishandled its response to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The walkout will begin at 12:30 p.m . and could involve anywhere between 50 and 200 people , said Christian Smalls , an assistant manager at the facility who is leading the walkout . 
Following the walkout , the workers will gather at a nearby public bus stop and speak to the press . 
Employees are protesting Amazon ’s decision to keep the Staten Island warehouse open despite news of a confirmed case of the virus there last week , Smalls said . 
Many more employees have tested positive for the virus at the facility than the company has publicly acknowledged , Smalls said , claiming that as many as five to seven workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus . 
Amazon did not immediately respond to several requests for comment .
