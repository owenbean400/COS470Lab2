Michael A . Lanotte , the executive director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association , said deaths have increased dramatically in New York City . 
" Since yesterday afternoon I have heard from more and more funeral directors in the city that have reached the capacity to help families , " Lanotte told CNN Friday . 
Lanotte said , " there is a lot of death happening in the hospitals , nursing homes , and in private homes . " 
Refrigeration is a big problem , Lanotte said , " In some cases there are funeral homes which have run out of storage , limiting their ability to help additional families . " 
" The volume is working against the process because the process takes time , we need extra storage , " he said . 
Efforts are being made to increase mobile morgues , Lanotte said .
