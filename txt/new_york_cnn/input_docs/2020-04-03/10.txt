The US military is preparing to deploy additional forces in support of the coronavirus response , including 15 Army task forces , a US defense official told CNN . 
The US Navy has placed two additional Navy Expeditionary Medical Treatment Facilities , one active duty and the other drawn from the reserves on " prepare to deploy orders . " 
The Navy earlier sent two of these units to New Orleans and Dallas . 
They consist of about 450 personnel , 150 of which are doctors . 
The location of where the units are being sent has yet to be determined and that decision will be made by Federal Emergency Management Agency . 
The official said the units should be ready to deploy in about 72 hours . 
While they are expected to go to New York , FEMA will make that decision . 
The Navy and Air Force are also mobilizing volunteer reservists . 
The Army has also created from its reserves 15 teams known as " Urban Area Medical Task Forces " to help bolster the coronavirus response . 
These teams will consist of 85 personnel each , 20 of whom will be doctors , for a total of 1,275 personnel . 
The task forces are intended to serve as an augmentation element , going into retrofitted arenas and convention centers in support of HHS . 
The official said these forces should be mobilized by Tuesday . 
There is acknowledgement within the Department of Defense that the situation in New York is deteriorating to the point where the US military has to draw more from its own medical capabilities , assuming risk at defense installations , in order to help combat the pandemic . 
By the numbers : These additional forces will join the US military 's 460 doctors , 1,117 nurses and other medical personnel already assisting civilian communities in their response to the coronavirus .
