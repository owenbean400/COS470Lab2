New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker says " there ’s no data to support the use of face masks " in protecting the public in the coronavirus pandemic . 
" Right now , there is not data…except for those who are ill and those who are health care workers , and that 's why we 're reserving those for health care workers , " Zucker said . 
He added that they continue to look at data all the time and are examining it on a rolling basis . 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said that he does not want the public to ease up on practicing social distancing if they wear face coverings . 
" I think it 's fair to say the masks could not hurt , unless they gave you a false sense of security , " he said . 
" . . . Might it help ? 
I think it 's fair to say yes , but do not get a false sense of security that now you do not have to social distance and you do not have to take the normal precautions because you 're wearing a bandana , " Cuomo said . 
Zucker agreed with the governor ’s assessment .
