The next generation is stepping into the forefront of the fight to protect essential employees in the coronavirus pandemic . 
College students Yolian Ogbu and Victory Nwabufo have teamed up with the National Children 's Campaign to launch a movement demanding universal hazard pay and personal protective equipment for all coronavirus essential employees in the US . 
And it 's all happening virtually under the hashtag # Your Workers My Family . 
The US Department of Labor defines hazard pay as " additional pay for performing hazardous duty or work " that is " not adequately alleviated by protective devices . " 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo proposed last week that hazard pay for frontline workers be included in a federal stimulus plan . 
Ogbu and Nwabufo said their effort has garnered support from essential workers , their families , unions and organizations . 
It will take the form of online story sharing and digital strikes that tweet bomb decision makers calling for paid sick leave , hazard pay and PPE . 
The campaign will culminate on Friday , International Workers ' Day , when many organizations are planning strikes of their own , they said .
