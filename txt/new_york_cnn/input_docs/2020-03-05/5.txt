Every day , there 's a growing global death toll . 
In the United States the coronavirus resembles a drumbeat in the distance : If you 're distracted , you may not hear it . 
Or maybe just once in a while . 
But if you listen carefully , you can hear it very clearly and ominously . 
But Trump is misinforming . 
The president 's statements to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday night were so at odds with what health experts are saying -- and millions of people were watching live . 
Last night , Trump reacted to the World Health Organization 's data driven assessment of the global death rate for the novel coronavirus -- 3.4 % -- by saying " I think the 3.4 % is really a false number . " 
Trump continued by discarding his own administration 's advice to stay home if you 're feeling sick : " If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better , just by , you know , sitting around and even going to work , some of them go to work , but they get better , and then when you do have a death , like you 've had in the state of Washington , like you had one in California , I believe you had one in New York . " 
No deaths have been reported in New York .
