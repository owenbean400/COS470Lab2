US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said wearing a covering over your nose and mouth in public could be viewed as a " sign of respect " in an effort to not spread the coronavirus . 
" I 've really been in the thick of this whole mask discussion , and we know that wearing a cloth facial covering prevents you from spreading to other people , " Adams told " Fox & Friends " this morning . 
" And I do think it 's a sign of respect , of appreciation for the fact that you could be asymptomatically spreading to someone else , " Adams said . 
" That 's something that governors are going to consider as they look at how do we safely reopen . " 
In early March , Adams told the general public to " stop buying masks . " 
He said at the time that wearing a mask improperly could increase your risk of contracting the coronavirus due to touching your face often when wearing the mask . 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo this week announced an executive order requiring everyone in the state to wear a face covering in public when not social distancing . 
Adams said on " Fox & Friends " on Friday that " in New York especially , I know that there are challenges -- because it 's a densely populated area -- with keeping people inside and if you 're going to go out , you wear your mask to protect me . 
I wear mine my facial covering to protect you . "
