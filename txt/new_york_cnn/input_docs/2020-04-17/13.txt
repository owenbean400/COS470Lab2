Dozens of inmates being housed at a federal minimum security prison camp in Otisville , New York , will be moved Friday to quarantine in an adjacent facility as they are processed for a potential early release due to the coronavirus pandemic , according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson . 
The prisoners , 111 in total , are mainly low security inmates who pose a low risk of recidivism , so they are likely to qualify for home confinement or a furloughed sentence , in line with standards set in a recent memo by Attorney General William Barr , who oversees the Bureau of Prisons . 
They are being moved now , as many of their cases are reviewed , so that they can begin serving a mandatory two week quarantine ahead of their potential release from federal custody , with the expectation that many will indeed be released , the spokesperson said . 
Some background : Some prisoners who 'd been housed at the prison camp , known for being one of the cushier federal facilities , have already been notified of their pending release . 
Michael Cohen , the President 's former fixer , was told Thursday by the Bureau of Prisons that he would be released early to serve out the remainder of his sentence under home confinement , CNN reported , citing people familiar with the matter and his lawyer . 
A Justice Department official also confirmed on Friday that Cohen would be released early .
