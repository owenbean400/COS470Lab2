The US has seen 66,000 more deaths so far this year than expected , a possible sign of the coronavirus ' impact , according to new estimates published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The estimates of what the CDC calls " excess deaths " can give a clearer picture of how many additional people may be dying overall and how many may be dying because of Covid 19 . 
These numbers can also capture those who did not have the illness , but were indirectly impacted by the pandemic -- for example , people who died at home because they did not go to the hospital or the people who could not get treatment because the hospital system was overwhelmed . 
How they calculated it : The CDC compared historic trends to the number of deaths observed for this year . 
Weekly counts of deaths from all causes were included , as well as the number of people who died from Covid 19 . 
Breakdown by state : Places that were coronavirus hot spots saw the highest excess deaths . 
For New York City , there were 17,152 excess deaths . 
For New York state , it was 10,044 . 
For New Jersey , it was 7,819 . 
Pennsylvania saw 7,319 . 
In Michigan it was 3,334 and Illinois it was 1,802 . 
Why this matters : Tracking these figures can give a truer sense of the death count from Covid 19 . 
Official Covid 19 death tolls can be inaccurate or misleading : Sometimes Covid 19 wo not be mentioned on a death certificate or a death could be misclassified .
