Across New York , Chinese restaurants have shut down and Asian American workers have filed for unemployment benefits at extraordinary rates . 
In the state , about 147,000 self identified Asian workers have filed initial unemployment claims in the last four weeks alone , up from just 2,100 during the same period last year . 
That 's a 6,900 % increase — by far the largest percentage increase experienced by any one racial or ethnic group . 
In contrast , claims were up 1,840 % for white workers , 1,260 % for black workers , and 2,100 % for Hispanic and Latino workers in New York . 
New York stands out from other states in that in early April , it started releasing detailed demographic breakdowns of unemployment claimants every week . 
Not surprisingly , claims are skyrocketing for every group in the state , reflecting the sharp economic downturn that nationwide has left 30 million Americans filing first time unemployment claims since mid March . 
But even so , the increase for Asian Americans is an oddity : It 's so large , it 's disproportionate to the size of their labor force . 
Asian workers make up about 9 % of New York state 's population and work force , but now account for 12.5 % of initial claims over the last four weeks . 
A year ago , they made up just 3.7 % of claims during the same time period . 
For the other groups , claims are either roughly in line — or well below — the size of their populations . 
White workers , for example , make up 65 % of New York 's labor force , but only 51 % of recent claims . 
What 's the cause ? 
Academics and members of the community point to several potential factors ranging from xenophobia to Asian Americans working in industries hard hit by the pandemic , including food and services . 
Many Asian workers also say they began social distancing earlier in the crisis than others — a factor that led some to close down businesses even before official lockdowns .
