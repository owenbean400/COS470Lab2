All school districts across New York state of New York are cleared to open , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said today . 
Following the announcement , New York City Department of Education Chancellor Richard Carranza said there are different models that city schools can put into effect for in person learning , and the city will revert to remote learning if there is an uptick in cases . 
" We are in a place where we can even consider now in person learning , and that why we 're happy that the governor given us the green light . 
We ’ve been preparing foe every eventuality since we pivoted to remote learning in March , " Carranza said in an interview with CNN ’s John King . 
New York City is the country ’s largest school district , with more than one million students . 
Carranza said he ’s asking parents to monitor any symptoms in their children and for employees to stay home if they feel sick . 
There will be temperature checks , mask requirements and cleaners sanitizing high touch areas . 
No more than 9 to 12 students will be allowed in one classroom at a time . 
The school system has different models for schools to implement , including rotating students on different days , Carranza said . 
" It ’s impossible to have 100 % of the students in a school building at the same time on any given day and still adhere to the safety protocols and the social distancing . 
So we ’ve put forward three to five models that we 've asked our schools to kind of try on for size , " he said .
