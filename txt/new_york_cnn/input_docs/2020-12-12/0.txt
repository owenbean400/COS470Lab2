Newly released data from the US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) shows more than 85 % of hospitals nationwide had more patients with Covid 19 last week than they did a month ago . Overall , about 1 in 5 hospital inpatients were confirmed to have Covid 19 last week – nearly double from a month earlier . 
Among America ’s 10 largest cities , the share of hospital patients with Covid 19 ranged from about 9 % in New York to 23 % in Chicago . 
They are : New York , 9 % ; 
Los Angeles , 16 % ; 
Chicago , 23 % ; 
Houston , 11 % ; 
Phoenix , 22 % ; 
Philadelphia , 22 % ; 
San Antonio , 16 % ; 
San Diego , 16 % ; 
Dallas , 20 % ; 
San Jose , 19 % . 
But in smaller cities the situation can be even worse . 
In El Paso , Texas , for example , more than 50 % of patients in city hospitals were confirmed to have Covid 19 – nearly double the national average for the seven day period between November 27 and December 3 . 
HHS had previously reported Covid 19 hospitalization data at the state level , but this dataset – released Monday – is the first from the national government to report local , facility level data .
