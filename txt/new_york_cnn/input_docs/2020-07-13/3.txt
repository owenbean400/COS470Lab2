New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo is offering to help other cities where coronavirus cases are rising , saying they should learn from what New York went through and follow the data and protocols that worked for the state . 
Cuomo told Atlanta , Georgia , Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms " anything we can do we stand ready " at his daily news briefing on Monday . 
" You have more than risen to the occasion , " Cuomo said . 
He pointed to the nurses and medical workers who came from across the country to help in New York hospitals when the state was hit hard by the virus , saying he wanted to " pay forward " that act of " generosity and love . " 
Cuomo offered to help Bottoms with setting up testing and other safety protocols . 
Bottoms , who tested positive for Covid 19 at the beginning of July , talked about the situation in the city saying ICU bed capacity is full in some hospitals . 
" We 're headed in the wrong direction , " she said . 
" New York was able to get to the other side , " she said , adding she was hopeful Atlanta would also get to the other side , but to do that , the city has to take actions and look at science and data .
