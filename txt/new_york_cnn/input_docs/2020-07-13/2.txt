New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo laid out the state 's criteria for schools to reopen in the fall across the state . 
He said that for a region to reopen its schools , it must be in phase four of reopening and the daily infection rate must be below 5 % , which means that " the virus is under control " and it is " safe to reopen , " the governor said . 
Cuomo said that " if the infection rate goes over 9% ... that means the virus is moving rapidly " and if that happens , schools will be closed . 
" That 's the green light and that 's the red light , " Cuomo said about the formula the state is going to use . 
The governor reiterated that the 700 school districts across the state are required to present their plan for reopening by the end of July . 
Cuomo said , " we 'll make the first decision " on who can reopen and how during the week of Aug . 1-7 . 
" The day the school opens , we continue to monitor , " he said . 
Just like the state is coordinating its economic reopening , Cuomo said reopening schools is " purely on the numbers , it â€™s on the science . "
