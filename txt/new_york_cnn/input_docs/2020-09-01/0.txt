New York state added two more states to its list of states and territories that are subject to its Covid 19 travel advisory , bringing the total to 33 . 
People traveling to the state from Alaska and Montana will now have to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival . 
New Jersey and Connecticut are expected to add the states to their list too , as all three neighbor states issued the same travel advisory guidance initially . 
" As we continue to pursue a phased , data driven reopening , the number of areas that remain on New York 's travel advisory is a stark reminder of the continued extent of the COVID 19 crisis throughout the nation , " said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo .
