New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy said " my advice is not to travel frankly " when asked about the state 's seven day average of Covid 19 infections . 
New Jersey 's average infection rate now qualifies for the state 's own quarantine list it has with New York and Connecticut , Murphy said . 
The state of New Jersey has already been on quarantine lists for Vermont and Massachusetts , according to Murphy . 
Murphy said he has not spoken to the governors of New York and Connecticut directly about the quarantine list but remains in active contact with them regarding " a number of things . " 
Murphy followed up on his comments advising NJ residents not to travel and said that it is ok for New Jersey residents to commute to work in other states and that traveling into New York and back is not a " quarantine event . " 
" I would prefer they do not travel and I do not mean commuting into work and back although there is a lot less of that than there was 8 months ago , but I mean just as a general matter . " 
Murphy said . 
Murphy again said that he would take a scalpel with regard to new closings in the state and that " everything remains on the table . "
