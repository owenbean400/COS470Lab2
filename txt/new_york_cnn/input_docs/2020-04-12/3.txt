New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wants to have community testing for coronavirus available by the end of next week . 
De Blasio said at a press conference Sunday he will be asking for 110,000 individualized tests from the federal government to make this a reality while setting up new testing centers in targeted communities . 
By the end of next week , de Blasio intends to set up Health and Hospitals testing centers in East New York , Brooklyn ; 
Morrisania Bronx ; 
Harlem , New York ; 
Jamaica , Queens and Clifton , Staten Island . 
This push for widespread community testing is part of " phase two , " de Blasio said . 
He said communities of color , lower income communities , immigrant communities , and vulnerable " folks who have not had the healthcare they needed and deserved throughout their life " have been impacted . 
These new testing centers also provide an opportunity to put some people back to work . 
De Blasio said the new sites , as well as public hospitals , and eventually private and voluntary systems , are hiring temporary , non clinical staff . 
These will include things like helping to transport patients , cleaning and maintenance of facilities . 
" I want to do everything I can to give people back their livelihood , " de Blasio said .
