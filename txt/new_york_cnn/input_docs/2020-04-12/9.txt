New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said everything , from business to schools , was closed regionally " and that ’s how we will go forward together " as the state looks at when and how the economy could reopen . 
This comes after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced yesterday that public schools in the city would remain closed for the rest of the academic year . 
A few hours later , Cuomo said no decision had been made yet . 
At a press conference Sunday , Cuomo was asked about his working relationship with de Blasio . 
He said he understood the mayor 's stance and that it 's " not an unreasonable position . " 
He added that unlike de Blasio , he has to worry about other counties and neighboring states when making decisions and said coordination with Connecticut and New Jersey would be optimal . 
Cuomo explained it is important to open business at the same time as schools because schools act in part as child care so parents can go to work . 
He added opening both at the same time is also critical for restarting the economy . 
" If you say the schools are closed through June , you are effectively saying businesses are closed through June because you ca not –– restart the economy fully without restarting schools , " Cuomo said .
