Citing numbers from the New York metropolitan area , Dr . Anthony Fauci told CNN he has " cautious optimism " the nation may be seeing a decrease in the rate of hospital admissions , patients admitted to intensive care and those needing intubation – resulting in the curve of cases decreasing . 
Fauci did say the nation is still seeing some hot spots in various locations . 
White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Dr . Deborah Birx had said Friday officials believed the nation had its peak , but more data was needed to confirm the status . 
As the President debates when to recommend the guidelines instituted by governors across the nation should be relaxed , Fauci told CNN there has to be a " gradual re entry " or a " rolling re entry . " 
" You ’re trying to balance two things : you wanna make sure you do not do something prematurely and precipitously , at the same time you pay attention to the need to get back to normal , " he said . 
Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious expert , added the nation cannot at one time drop the various restrictions put in place or there is an " extraordinary risk " of another major outbreak . 
He said different parts of the country will have to do it in different ways , partly depending on whether those locations have seen major outbreaks already or are facing future ones .
