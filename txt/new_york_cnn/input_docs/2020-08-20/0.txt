Costa Rica has announced that US residents flying from six northeastern states will be allowed entry next month to help revitalize its tourism sector , which has been negatively impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Starting in September , Costa Rica will allow six weekly flights for residents from New York , New Jersey , New Hampshire , Maine , Vermont , and Connecticut , the country â€™s tourism minister Gustavo Segura said at a news conference on Wednesday . 
People entering Costa Rica must show an official identification from one of the six US states , Segura said . 
Travelers must also present a negative Covid 19 test result taken no more than 48 hours before the flight and have travel insurance to cover any possible medical care . 
" This gradual opening is still slight , but it is a message of hope not to lose strength and to understand that there is light at the end of the tunnel , " Segura said .
