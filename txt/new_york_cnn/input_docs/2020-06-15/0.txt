Shutting down businesses for not following social distancing practices have to be left " on the table as a consideration , " New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy told NBC News Monday morning . 
" You have to leave that on the table as a consideration . 
I hope to god we do not have to , " he said on the " Today " show . 
Meanwhile , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo , warned in a press conference Sunday that high violations of Covid 19 restrictions could cause the state to roll back its reopening . 
About 25,000 complaints have been filed against businesses across New York – mainly in Manhattan and the Hamptons – for violating that state ’s reopening plan . 
" If we have a high number of violations of the policy which is tantamount to a high likelihood of the spread of the virus , and the local governments are not monitoring policing , doing the compliance , yes there is a very real possibility that we would roll back the reopening in those areas . 
The only alternative would be to pause the entire reopening , " Cuomo said .
