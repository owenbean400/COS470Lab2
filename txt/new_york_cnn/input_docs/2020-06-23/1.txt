No state has effectively transitioned from lockdown " to a public health model of testing , tracking , isolating and quarantining " during the Covid 19 pandemic , said Dr . Richard Besser , former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Speaking today on CNN ’s New Day , Besser said to control the spread of the virus , states " need a public health system that 's working . 
You need messaging lined up around that . " 
" In New York where they 've hired thousands and thousands of contact tracers , we are hearing that there 's problems – that people do not want to tell them who they had contact with , " Besser explained . 
" I think part of that is that a lot of the social benefits in terms of income support , eviction protection , foreclosure protection , are going away – and so for somebody to go into quarantine – it could mean losing their job . "
