New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he expects New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo will close indoor dining and gyms in the next week or two . 
The mayor said in a news conference this morning that after speaking with the governor at length yesterday and with cases showing a clear uptick , the city will move to the orange zone . 
In that zone , indoor dining and gyms will be closed . 
The mayor also reiterated , " We will bring our schools back , but we have to reset the equation . " 
Yesterday , de Blasio announced that the city 's public schools would close today as coronavirus cases rise in the city . 
De Blasio said for those who might feel a little better if they knew indoor dining and gyms were going to be closed , " It ’s just a matter of time . " 
This comes after the governor said Wednesday New York City ’s Covid 19 numbers could warrant putting the city into an orange zone soon .
