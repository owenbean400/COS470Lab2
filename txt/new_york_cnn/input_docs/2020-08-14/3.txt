Columbia University and Barnard College in New York City jointly announced the decision to have all undergraduate courses given remotely for the fall 2020 semester . 
There will be no residential housing for undergraduates at Barnard , and Columbia will only have limited housing available . 
Just six weeks ago , Columbia had announced its plans to bring back 60 % of undergraduates in Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science . 
Those plans have since been significantly pulled back . 
" Today we have concluded that we must drastically scale back the number of students we can accommodate in residence on campus , thereby limiting residential style living only to Columbia College and SEAS undergraduates who must be present on campus due to personal or academic circumstances , " said a letter sent Friday by University President Lee C . Bollinger . 
Barnard College 's announcement said the decision to move all undergraduate classes online came in part as a result of New York state 's travel advisory list , which now includes 31 states and two territories . 
Barnard will refund all room and board charges and is giving a 10 % tuition reduction for the fall semester , according to the letter .
