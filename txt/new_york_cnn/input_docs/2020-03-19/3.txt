The high profile New York restaurant group which runs the city 's Union Square Cafe is slashing its workforce by 80 % and laying off around 2,000 people in the wake of coronavirus related closures . 
The cuts are a result of " a near complete elimination of revenue , " Union Square Hospitality Group ( USHG ) said in a statement . 
The company operates restaurants and event businesses in New York , Las Vegas , Washington DC and other cities . 
Meyer opened Union Square Cafe in 1985 . 
" The reality is that we 've had to make drastic and previously unimaginable choices for how we conduct business just to protect our team and our communities ... in doing so , our revenues have been decimated , and the foundation of our business has been seriously tested , " he said in a statement . 
Meyer will forgo his salary and members of the executive team will take pay cuts , which will go into an employee relief fund with other donations . 
" The goal is to rehire as many of those people as soon as possible , when health and business conditions permit , " USHG said in the announcement . 
Industry insiders have warned that the temporary closures of restaurants and bars across the US could devastate the industry . 
The National Restaurant Association said restaurants will need $ 325 billion from the government to help workers and employers .
