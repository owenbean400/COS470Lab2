New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo attempted to assuage concerns this morning by saying " there is no quarantine plan for New York City " as it relates to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . 
Cuomo went on to discuss New Rochelle , which is in Westchester County . 
As of Wednesday morning , 538 of the more than 2,380 cases in New York state were in Westchester County . 
Some context : On Tuesday , Cuomo dismissed the possibility of an imminent shelter in place order after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to prepare for the measure . 
De Blasio told New Yorkers to prepare for the possibility within the next two days . 
" I think New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a shelter in place order , " de Blasio , a Democrat , said during a press briefing about coronavirus . 
" It has not happened yet but it is definitely a possibility at this point . 
I believe that decision should be made in the next 48 hours , and it 's a very , a very difficult decision . " 
However , a shelter in place order would have to be approved by Gov . 
Cuomo .
