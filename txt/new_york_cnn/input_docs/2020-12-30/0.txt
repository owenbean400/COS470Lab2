Unemployment benefits for workers will be extended through March 14 , but relief may be held up because President Trump delayed signing the coronavirus relief package . 
Amir Bukhari and Fareeha Haq are raising their family of six in Brooklyn , New York , on less than $ 400 a week in unemployment , and they could go without that money next week . 
" It ’s going to hit rock bottom , " Bukhari told CNN ’s Vanessa Yurkevich . 
The money that was supposed to arrive this week was going to feed the family , he said . 
The couple lost their jobs in March . 
Under the relief package , the jobless will receive a $ 300 weekly federal enhancement in benefits through March 14 . 
The amount is half of the earlier federal boost , which ran out at the end of July . 
Also , the deal extends by 11 weeks two other pandemic unemployment programs that were created in the $ 2 trillion CARES Act in March and were set to expire at year 's end . 
An estimated 12 million laid off workers in these programs were facing the loss of their aid . 
Haq used to work at the Council of Peoples Organization handing out food . 
Now she relies on the nonprofit to help feed her family . 
" I was there helping people receive benefits , and now I 'm on the other end and I 'm asking for benefits , " she said .
