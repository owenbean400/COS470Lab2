The coronavirus pandemic is as bad as it ’s ever been across the country , but it ’s going to get even worse , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo during a briefing on Monday . 
Holiday travel and gatherings have amplified the already expected effect of cooler weather driving people indoors more . 
" You ’d expect that the effect of the Thanksgiving surge would be probably another week and week and a half from now , because it ’s usually two and a half weeks from the time of the event , " Fauci said . 
" The problem is , that ’s going to come right up to the beginning of the Christmas , Hannukah potential surge . " 
There ’s a surge upon a surge , Fauci said . 
And before anyone can even try to cope with that , people will travel over the winter holiday period and there will be more of the gatherings of family and friends that have been fueling the pandemic . 
" We could start to see things really get bad in the middle of January , " Fauci predicted . 
Fauci also reminded Americans that they can mitigate the spread . 
" It ’s such a natural thing to think , when I have family and friends over for the holidays , Christmas and Hanukkah , you get indoors you take your mask off because you 're eating and drinking . 
And you do not realize that there may be somebody that you know , that you love , that 's a friend , that 's a family member , who is perfectly well with no symptoms , and yet they got infected in the community , and brought it into that small gathering that you 're now having in your home , " he said . 
He urged people to take the same precautions at small family gatherings that they do when they are around strangers : wear a mask , wash your hands , watch your distance and meet either outdoors in well ventilated spaces
