New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wants to move middle schools back to in person learning as quickly as possible , and as early as January . 
Improving remote learning is a constant focus of the city 's Department of Education , chancellor Richard Carranza said . 
He has been speaking with colleagues in other large urban school systems and " generally speaking " all are seeing that " not all children are doing well " in the virtual learning environment . 
He said he is proud of staff who are intervening when they feel a student is not doing as well as they could be . 
Every phase of the pandemic has provided for " imperfect " learning solutions , and he said he looks forward to the time when in person learning can return 100 % . 
He said there is " tremendous hope on the horizon , " and its important that individuals " push through . " 
He earlier said well over 150 of those schools are in full 5 days of instructions , though noted clearer numbers were come Tuesday morning . 
Last month , New York schools announced it would begin phasing out hybrid learning and move toward resuming in person classes after citywide shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
At the time , de Blasio announced students in 3K , Pre K and grades K 5 could resume in person classes today , but the mayor noted that the city will address when middle and high schoolers can return to in person classes in the future .
