Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , a New York Democrat , requested a briefing next week from top administration public health officials , including Dr . Anthony Fauci and Dr . Deborah Birx , on recent coronavirus spikes in states around the country . 
Schumer 's remarks come as Vice President Mike Pence is set to meet this afternoon with the task force for the second time this week . 
Some context : CNN reported last month that the task force has been sharply curtailed , meeting about once a week . 
While task force members have been on conference calls with governors weekly , there has not been a briefing from the task force since April 27 .
