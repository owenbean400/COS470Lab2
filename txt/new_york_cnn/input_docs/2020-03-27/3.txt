Certain coronavirus " hot spots " in the United States are expected to see the pandemic hit even harder next week , US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said on CBS . 
" The virus and the local community are going to determine the timeline . 
It 's not going to be us from Washington , DC . 
People need to follow their data , they need to make the right decisions based on what their data is telling them , " Adams added . 
He said the US has seen a significant increase in testing , which is " good news . " 
" We 're approaching a million tests . 
We 're trying to give people the data so that they can make informed decisions about where they are on their timeline and what they should be doing , " he said . 
During a White House briefing yesterday , Vice President Mike Pence said that " in partnership with commercial labs across America , this morning we received word that 552,000 tests have been performed and completed all across the United States . " 
Adams also said Friday that as the coronavirus pandemic continues , each region in the United States might experience differences in case numbers and deaths . 
" Everyone 's curve is going to be different , " Adams said . 
" New York is going to look different than Boise , Idaho or Jackson , Mississippi , or New Orleans . "
