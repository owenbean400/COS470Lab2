New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo appeared to respond to comments from the President that the state may not need as many ventilators as the governor has been asking for this week . 
Cuomo did not directly call out President Trump , but he said , " everyone is entitled to an opinion " when asked about pushback on his projection that New York needs 30,000 more ventilators . 
He added , " I do not operate on opinion . " 
On the 30,000 additional ventilators he believes New York needs , Cuomo said , " that 's what the data and the science said . " 
He noted that scientists have told him the state may need 140,000 hospital beds and as many as 40,000 ventilators at the apex of the outbreak . 
Cuomo said he will " make the decisions based on the data and the science " and " the numbers say you may need 30,000 " additional ventilators . 
More context : During an interview with Sean Hannity on Thursday , Trump appeared to downplay Cuomo 's request for tens of thousands of more ventilators for his state . 
" I do not believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators , " Trump told Hannity , an apparent reference to New York .
