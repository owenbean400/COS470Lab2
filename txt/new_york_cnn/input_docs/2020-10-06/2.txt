New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said local governments will be responsible for enforcing the new Covid 19 cluster restrictions announced today . 
Cuomo said that the lack of enforcement has contributed to the current problems being seen in Covid clusters in New York state . 
All local governments will be required to assign people to a state enforcement task force , he said . 
New York City will be required to assign 400 personnel to the enforcement task force . 
" The state does not have the resources to do enforcement , it must be done by the local level . 
I have no problem doing it . 
I just do not have the resources to do it , " Cuomo said .
