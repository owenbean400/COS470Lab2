New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that no decision has been made on his proposal to close non essential businesses and revert restaurants to takeout only in the 9 hot spot zip codes by Wednesday . 
Conversations continue he said , adding " we need obviously a clear decision in the course of today so we can move forward . " 
It is the state ’s ultimate decision , he noted , but he is " prepared to implement as soon as tomorrow morning in those 9 zip codes once we have the signoff from the state . " 
The closures would not affect religious institutions per his proposal . 
De Blasio ’s initial proposal also called for school closures by Wednesday .
