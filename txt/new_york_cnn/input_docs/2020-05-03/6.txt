New York Sen . 
Chuck Schumer is calling for the federal government to stop predatory lenders from preying on people who are in desperate need of emergency funds as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause economic hardship for millions of Americans , in a press release issued Sunday . 
He said that " loan sharks " will stop at nothing to drown everyday consumers and small businesses " in a cascade of debt that could far outlast the coronavirus itself . " 
" Interest rate loans that can hover around 800 % are not just eye popping –– they ’re downright shameful , " the release said . 
Schumer wants the nation ’s federal regulators , including the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , to act and stop rolling back regulations that enable predatory lenders to prey on people .
