New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the state will now require all hospitals to build a 90 day supply of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus hospitalizations . 
Cuomo said New York , and the rest of the country , needs to " institutionalize these lessons " that were learned during the outbreak . 
" We ca not go through this day to day moving masks across the state . 
This mad scramble we 're in and still are in in many ways . 
As a nation , we ca not go through it again , " he said . 
Cuomo said it is important to prepare for another surge of infections . 
" People talk about this like it 's going to come and go and so once in a lifetime . 
I do not know it 's once in a lifetime , " he said . 
" If you look back as far back as 1918 when they had the flu pandemic people talk about , it took 10 months . 
It came in three different waves , and the second wave was worse than the first wave , " Cuomo added . 
" So let 's be prepared and intelligent . "
