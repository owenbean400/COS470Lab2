Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo warned that " we 're not out of the woods " when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic in New York . 
" We never said it was over . 
We said the numbers are going down , " he added . 
" Roughly a thousand new people a day walk into the hospitals . " 
Cuomo said the reason numbers in the state are generally trending down is because New Yorkers followed social distancing and other measures . 
" You go back to the old behavior and that number goes right back up , " Cuomo said .
