New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo is signing two executive orders to help enforce social distancing rules and regulations as the state , and New York City , continue to reopen . 
On Thursday , Cuomo cited the two biggest issues statewide : Compliance by people and enforcement by local government . 
The first executive order will allow the State Liquor Authority ( SLA ) to immediately suspend alcohol licenses if bars or restaurants are violating the rules . 
For other businesses violating the rules , they could have an immediate shut down order . 
The second executive order makes bars responsible for the area immediately in front of their premises including the sidewalk and SLA can enforce this . 
The governor said he wants to help ensure there is not a slide back and people do not get careless .
