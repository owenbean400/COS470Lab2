New York could be at the apex of coronavirus cases according to new projections shown at a press briefing . 
Jim Malatras , the president of SUNY Empire State College , said new models show a much lower projection . 
Some of the initial models predicted that up to 110,000 beds would be needed for coronavirus patients alone , and another that suggested 55,000 beds were needed . 
Both of the early models showed the peak — or apex — occurring at the end of April . 
Malatras said a new , more optimistic projection can be attributed to social distancing . 
" We saw the folks looking at those types of model says it was going so what activities and actions could you take to aggressively lower that overall number , " Malatras said . 
" The answer really was , and what the governor ’s been doing , was aggressively enforce and enact social distancing to lower the overall number and this number , and the current data suggests that is exactly what 's happening . " 
Remember : Malatras said that while the new model is hopeful , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo will continue to take it one day at a time .
