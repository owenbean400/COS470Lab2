A New York doctor said Monday that hospitals in the state are overwhelmed as more patients arrive with coronavirus . 
Dr . Craig Spencer , the director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center , said emergency rooms are being converted into intensive care units and morgues are filling up . 
" We have trucks outside to hold bodies , those are getting filled , " Spencer told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on " The Situation Room . " 
He said while data shows the number of new infections is decreasing , there is a lag time between when people get sick and when they come to emergency rooms . 
" In the best case scenario , it may be another week or two before we have a decrease in the really , really sick patients , " he said . 
Spencer said social distancing is still very important and is the best way to continue to battle the virus and continue to decrease numbers . 
" Instead of peddling a bunch of treatments that we do not know whether they work or some magic bullet , we know what does work -- if you stay home , you will not get infected with this virus . 
If you do not get infected with this virus , you will not show up sick in the emergency room , " he said .
