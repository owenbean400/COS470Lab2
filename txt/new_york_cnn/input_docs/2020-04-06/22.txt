Pregnant women do not seem to be any more susceptible to severe symptoms of Covid 19 , compared to the general population and they do not seem to pass the infection onto their babies , according to a new study , The small study was published Monday in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and looked at data from 43 pregnant women in New York who tested positive for Covid 19 over two weeks between March 13 and 27 . 
Thirty seven of the women in the study experienced a mild form of Covid 19 , four developed a severe form of the disease and two experienced what researchers called " critical disease . " 
The percentages are similar to the breakdown of severity in disease in the general population . 
About 80 % experience mild disease , 15 % develop severe cases and 5 % result in critical cases . 
Scientists were interested in the impact of the disease on pregnant women because in prior SARS and H1N1 pandemics , pregnant women were more susceptible to serious forms of the illness and had a greater chance of dying from the infection than the general population . 
None of the babies in this study seemed to be infected , based on tests performed on them on the first day of their lives .
