Scott Stringer , the New York City comptroller whose mother died from coronavirus , said he is angry at the federal government 's response to the pandemic . 
About the ship : The USNS Comfort hospital ship docked in New York City last week . 
The original plan was for the the ship to treat non coronavirus patients to ease the strain on area hospitals seeing an influx of infected patients . 
But today , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said he believes the right move is for the ship to utilize its 1000 bed capacity to battle the coronavirus . 
Trump has said the ship could be used for coronavirus patients if needed . 
Stringer said his mother was a strong woman and the only way he was able to get closure was through an outpouring of texts and support from strangers . 
" The government is supposed to protect our people and we 're supposed to be able to protect our parents and grandparents the way they protected us and we 're not able to do that , " Stringer said .
