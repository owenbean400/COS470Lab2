The first time Dominique Shuminova saw her newborn daughter , Clara , after giving birth , it was only her eyes that could smile . 
The rest of her face was covered by a black mask , thanks to Covid 19 . 
Baby Clara will always have that picture to show her own children and grandchildren a world turned upside down when she came into it . 
Shuminova will always have the combined joy and pain — both emotional and physical — of delivering her daughter in the time of the novel coronavirus . 
She delivered in New York , a Covid 19 hot spot where partners of women delivering babies are not allowed to come to the hospital , per state order . 
So , her husband , Eldar , had to stay home with their son Henry . 
Those of us who have given birth know it is hard in any circumstance . 
It turned out that she did it with more pain than she had planned for . 
She says she could not get an epidural because , when it was time , she was told that all of the hospital ’s anesthesiologists were busy intubating patients with Covid 19 . 
And why the mask ? 
Shuminova says that when she was admitted to the hospital at 5 a.m . ET Sunday morning , the hospital had to test her for coronavirus . 
Because the test took about 18 hours to come back , they treated her as if she were positive — so she was told to wear one . 
That meant that she went through the whole delivery alone , with no epidural , trying to breathe properly , as all women in labor do , all while wearing a mask . 
Still , Shuminova has it all in perspective . 
" Given the circumstances I am just grateful to have a bed and medical care , " she said in a text message . 
She is healthy . 
Her newborn daughter is healthy . 
Especially in these times , that is nothing to be taken for granted .
