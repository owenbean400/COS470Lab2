There are 107 school districts in New York state that have not submitted plans for reopening , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said today . 
Cuomo said that because the viral transmission rate in New York is one of the lowest in the United States , districts can reopen . 
" Yes , you can reopen , " Cuomo said . 
" If you have a smart plan . " 
New York City public schools submitted a supplemental plan over the weekend , and Cuomo urged the district to make the plan public and get input from parents and teachers . 
" If the parents of NYC and the teachers of NYC say it is a safe plan then it is a safe plan . 
Education is fundamentally a local responsibility , " he said .
