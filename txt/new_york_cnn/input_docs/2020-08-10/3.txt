New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo and Kentucky Gov . 
Andy Beshear said Monday that they believe President Trump ’s executive actions on coronavirus relief are " unworkable . " 
The extension reduced previous federal unemployment benefits to $ 400 from the $ 600 level that expired at the end of July after Congress failed to reach a deal on the benefits ’ future . 
States are being asked to cover 25 % of the enhanced unemployment benefits . 
Both governors said the order would increase the cost on states that are already struggling financially due to economic impacts of coronavirus lockdown and response to the pandemic , and would bankrupt some states . 
" My motivation today is not to criticize or suggest that the President ’s Executive Order was not intended to help , but simply to make the point that it ’s not workable in its current form , " Beshear said , on the call . 
Beshear added that he wanted a congressional solution , and for an unemployment benefit " at the $ 600 level . " 
Cuomo said it would cost the state of New York $ 4 billion between now and December to pay 25 % of the unemployment insurance for New Yorkers . 
Cuomo added that the executive order " will be challenged in court " and that there are " serious legal questions " about the authority Trump had to issue the order . 
Cuomo said Congress would have to pass a federal law to allow a state to go bankrupt . 
He challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell , of Beshear ’s home state , to pass such a law . 
" I challenge Mc Connell to propose the law to bankrupt states . 
And watch the markets plummet overnight . 
They think they ’re going to help bring jobs back ? 
That ’s what you ’re going to do ? 
By proposing to bankrupt states ? 
Then do it . "
