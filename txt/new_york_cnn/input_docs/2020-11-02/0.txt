New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he 's keeping " a very close eye " on rising coronavirus cases as the percent of people who have tested positive reaches " worrisome levels , " but that hospital capacity was still under control . 
The city wide positivity rate has hit 2.08 % , de Blasio said , adding that the seven day rolling average of 1.81 % was a " better number " and " more consistent with where we ’ve been . " 
The daily number of people in New York City admitted to hospitals for Covid 19 is at 80 , and the confirmed positivity rate for those patients is 16.8 % . 
According to de Blasio , both figures " in the scheme of things " are " pretty good for today . " 
Meanwhile , 21 public schools across the city are currently closed for a 2 week period under Covid 19 protocols , though the mayor advised the number changes every day as schools transition in and out of this process . 
" The schools overall have been extraordinarily safe , " de Blasio said , adding that the city continues to take cautioned steps that he says so far have been effective . 
New York -- once the epicenter of the pandemic as the largest and densest city in the US -- began gradually reopening in June . 
At the city ’s peak in April , more than 500 people were dying every day and hospitals and funeral homes were overwhelmed . 
In total , New York City has recorded 256,434 coronavirus cases , 19,350 confirmed deaths and 4,663 " probable deaths " related to Covid 19 , according to the city 's public health agency .
