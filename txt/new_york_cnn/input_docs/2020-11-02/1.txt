New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press call Monday that he will not cooperate with a request from the federal government to share patient information with it in order to be eligible to receive Covid 19 vaccinations . 
Cuomo said that US states recently received a " data sharing form agreement " from the federal government , which he says requires states to agree to share with it patient health information -- including identification information such as a driver â€™s license number , passport number , or social security number -- in order to receive shipments of the Covid 19 vaccine when it becomes available . 
Cuomo said the agreement indicates that patient information will be used by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and " other federal partners , " but said he believes it is another tactic for the Trump administration to target undocumented immigrants . 
" This is just another example of them trying to extort the state of New York to get info that they can use at the Department of Homeland Security and ICE [ US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ] to deport people , " Cuomo said . 
In the same briefing , Cuomo said the proposed federal vaccination program 's infrastructure would " have a discriminatory effect " on poor , Black and brown communities . 
He criticized using private health infrastructure such as CVS and Walgreens to administer the vaccine because those outlets have far fewer branches in the neighborhoods of disadvantaged communities . 
Background : Cuomo has previously criticized the proposed federal vaccine program 's use of private health infrastructure for other reasons . 
He has argued that these venues cannot quickly and effectively administer the vaccine without overwhelming the nation 's pandemic response capabilities , since they are already being charged with Covid 19 diagnostic testing . 
Cuomo has said he would prefer the option of establishing a public , state run program for vaccination administration , but that the federal government has not agreed to provide funding for it .
