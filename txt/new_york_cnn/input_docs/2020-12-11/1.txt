Hospitals eagerly awaiting the coronavirus vaccine , which could be authorized soon , have been planning on how to administer it properly and safely . 
Each coronavirus vaccine dose would need to be placed into sub zero freezers within 90 seconds from the time they are unboxed , according to Dr . Susan Mashni , chief pharmacy officer for the Mount Sinai Health System . 
Before anyone is vaccinated , it takes about three hours to defrost the vaccine to room temperature , she said . 
Teams have been running practice drills to prepare for quickly storing them , Mashni said . 
Once a vaccine is authorized , Mashni said Mount Sinai is ready to start administering it by Monday or Tuesday . 
They â€™ll be pulling in hundreds of people for extra staffing , including medical students and interns , she said .
