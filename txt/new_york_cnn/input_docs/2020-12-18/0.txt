New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Friday that the state ’s hospitals are in " crisis management " mode and capacity has been added at facilities across the state . 
Cuomo said the state ’s department of health mandated that 25 % additional capacity be added and advised that hospitals should cancel elective surgeries if there are capacity issues . 
Accordingly , about 31,000 hospital beds have been added in New York ’s " downstate " region , Cuomo said . 
The New York Department of Health has also mandated that hospitals notify state officials if they are three weeks away from reaching 85 % maximum capacity . 
If such a threshold is reached , the state would move to shutdown the economy in that area , Cuomo said . 
However , no hospital in the state has given the health department any such notice , which Cuomo said was " good news . " 
Additionally , New York reported a statewide positivity rate of 5.09 % on Friday , and Covid 19 hospitalizations , ICU patients , and intubation numbers across the state are all down , Cuomo said .
