New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said he will ask the state 's business leaders to reduce workplace density during the coronavirus outbreak . 
Possible tactics include running two shifts of workers and letting workers who can work from home to do so . 
He said in a city like New York City , " there ’s no such thing as social distancing , you ’re always within six feet of a person . " 
" We do not want to overreact but we understand we have to take aggressive actions and we ’re looking at all those large gatherings today and I will have an announcement either later today or tomorrow . " 
Cuomo said the state cases as of this morning are at 193 — but added , " we ’re going to get another tranche of numbers in the next couple of hours . " 
" We test around the clock now so the number constantly adjusts , but it is constantly going up and that should not give people alarm , " he said . 
Cuomo said he anticipates the number of cases will keep going up for weeks , and warned that the virus is " much more advanced than we are seeing in any of these numbers . "
