A New York health official told CNN 's New Day that the goal of the state 's containment zone is to " prevent exposure , because if there is no exposure there is no risk . " 
Asked about whether the move had come too late for the city of New Rochelle , Westchester County Health Commissioner Dr . Sherlita Amler said " it 's never too late , because although we have over a hundred cases , we do not have thousands of cases yet , and that ’s what you want to prevent . " 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday plans to deploy the National Guard and create a one mile containment area in New Rochelle in an attempt to stop a growing cluster of coronavirus cases . 
She said that in terms of trying to track individual cases , " we ’re getting to a point where that ’s really not going to be very productive . 
We have to have a broader -- a broader reach , a broader plan . "
