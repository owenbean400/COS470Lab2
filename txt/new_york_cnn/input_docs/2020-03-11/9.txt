The Federal Aviation Administration announced today that due the coronavirus related flight cancelations , it will waive a requirement that the industry says could otherwise lead to airlines running empty flights . 
The requirement normally requires that airlines use 80 % of their assigned runway slots at several busy airports — including La Guardia and John F . Kennedy in New York and Reagan National in Washington , DC . 
There are four other airports — Chicago O 'Hare , Newark Liberty , Los Angeles International and San Francisco — at which the agency has a formal schedule review and approval process . 
The FAA said it will give credit to airlines for flights that were canceled at those airports due to the virus . 
Most major US airlines have moved to cancel a significant portion of their flights due to the outbreak , raising the possibility that they will not meet the targets . 
Without the waiver , the airlines risked losing their slots . 
The agency said the waiver is good through the end of May .
