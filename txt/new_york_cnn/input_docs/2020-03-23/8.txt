New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo issued an emergency order to hospitals to increase their bed capacity by 50 % . 
" You must increase your capacity by 50 % , " he said in an ongoing press conference in Albany . 
" I think it ’s unreasonable to say to every hospital basically , ‘ double your capacity . ’ 
I do not think it ’s unreasonable to say , ‘ try to reach 100 % increase ’ but you must reach a 50 % increase , ' " he said . 
Cuomo also confirmed that the state will build four emergency hospitals with the help of the federal government to deal with the need for increased hospital capacity due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
He called this " a big deal . " 
Cuomo was complimentary of the President in helping make that happen . 
" President Trump did deliver yesterday , " Cuomo said . 
He added : " That 's government working , that 's government working quickly , and I thank him for it . "
