New York City hospitals will only be able to get through " this week " before they start getting " to a point where people ca not be saved , " New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN ’s John Berman on " New Day " Monday morning . 
" In our public hospitals , our 11 public hospitals right now , this week , I can only guarantee you right now , John , that we can get through this week with the equipment and supplies we have . 
That 's the blunt reality , " de Blasio said . 
He added : " If we do not get some relief quickly , and I can count , John , I literally want to see hundreds of ventilators , I want to see first hundreds of thousands and millions of masks , if that does not come in starting this week , we will get to a point where people ca not be saved who could have been saved . " 
More than 34,300 Americans have been infected with coronavirus across all 50 states , and at least 414 people have died . 
Almost half all US cases — 16,887 — are in New York state . 
" If we do not get ventilators this week , we are going to start losing lives we could have saved . 
I ca not be blunter than that , " he said . 
Last week they mayor ’s office said New York City needs 45 million surgical gowns , coveralls , gloves , and face masks – known as personal protective equipment ( PPE ) – provided early in April to ensure its healthcare system can deal with coronavirus related issues .
