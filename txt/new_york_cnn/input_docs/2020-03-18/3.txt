Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer talked about what Senate Democrats want in the next phase of economic stimulus relief today . 
The New York lawmaker said " Democrats are proposing a Marshall Plan for our public health infrastructure . 
The sooner we act on it the better . " 
" We must make sure that we prioritize public health and workers over corporate bailouts , " Schumer said . 
On the Republican proposals for direct cash payments to Americans , Schumer said , " This is not a time for small thinking . 
This is not a time for small measures . 
This is a time to be bold , to be aggressive …. $ 1,000 goes by pretty quickly if you ’re unemployed . 
In contrast , expanded unemployment insurance , beefed up unemployment insurance covers you for a much longer time and would provide a much bigger safety net . " 
Schumer added : " If we ’re going to provide direct payments , they need to be bigger , more frequent , more targeted . 
Millionaires should not get them . "
