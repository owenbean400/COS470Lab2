Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo reiterated the virus should peak in 45 days and is again asking for up to 110,000 beds with current capacity of 53,000 beds . 
Cuomo met yesterday with all hospital administrators to identify up 50,000 new beds . 
The state will waive Department of Health regulations which include the space in a given room and how many beds are in it . 
The state has a current capacity of 3,000 ventilators , but Cuomo wants 37,000 ICU units and he equated an ICU bed to a ventilator given the setup . 
" That ’s our main issue , " Cuomo said , adding , " That ’s a projection and projections can change . " 
The state needs more current and reserve staff and the state is reaching out to retired nurses and doctors as well as medical and nursing schools to build up reserve capacity . 
How this may work : In order to get new hospital beds , the state is looking to convert facilities and move people who are currently in hospital beds to a converted facility for a lower level of care should the case apply . 
Reiterating the needs for a federal partnership , the governor said the state cannot do it on its own . 
" We are very ambitious , very aggressive , " but " Know what we cannot do . 
Know your limitations , " Cuomo said .
