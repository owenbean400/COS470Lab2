The US Navy hospital USNS Comfort could still be a " few weeks " away from arriving in New York , a US defense official tells CNN . 
Both Navy hospital ships have " prepare to deploy " orders , two defense officials said . 
President Trump said Wednesday they â€™d launch in the next week or so . 
Both ships will start getting ready , with crew and medical staff . 
It is expected at this point the medical staff will be trauma care specialists , at least to begin with , so their presence can free up bed space in New York City hospitals . 
They will try for all due speed to get there , the officials said .
