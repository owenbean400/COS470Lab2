New York state will send remdesivir , the drug used to fight Covid 19 , to Florida to help the state fight the resurgence of Covid 19 cases , a statement from Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo ’s office said . 
The statement issued Friday said the drug should arrive in Florida on Saturday and that New York is sending enough of the medication to help state care for at least 280 Covid 19 patients while it waits for federal aid . 
" We will stand by our fellow Americans every step of the way as our nation fights COVID 19 together , " he added . 
Remember : In the US , remdesivir — currently administered intravenously through infusions — is the only drug that has an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus infections . 
Gilead originally studied remdesivir as a potential treatment for Ebola , but lab experiments suggested it might be active against the coronavirus that causes Covid 19 . 
According to a study published in May by the New England Journal of Medicine , data showed remdesivir shortened the course of illness from an average of 15 days to about 11 days . 
The maker of the drug , Gilead , later announced in a statement that claimed remdesivir could also be helpful in treating moderate Covid 19 pneumonia .
