New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the USNS Comfort docked in New York City will now treat patients with coronavirus . 
The ship was originally planned to treat non coronavirus patients , to open up capacity at the city 's on shore hospitals . 
He said President Trump " moved expeditiously " with the Department of Defense to make the switch . 
" I want to thank the President for moving as quickly as he did , " Cuomo said . 
The ship , which is typically a 1,000 bed hospital , will now have 500 beds , since Covid 19 patients require more space for treatment and equipment , the governor explained . 
The Comfort , as well as the hospital set up at the Javits Center , are " a welcome overload relief to the hospital system , which is already extraordinarily stressed , " he said .
