New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said he is worried about coronavirus cases and hospitalizations increasing again as some people start to leave their homes . 
" The weather has turned warm . 
People have been in their homes for one month , everyone has cabin fever and they 're coming out in greater numbers , " Cuomo told CNN 's Erin Burnett . 
Earlier Tuesday , Cuomo said at his daily press briefing that hospitalizations may be leveling off and social distancing " is working , " but stressed that New Yorkers need to keep doing it . 
He told Burnett his focus is not merely on preventing a second wave , but working to improve the current situation in New York -- an epicenter for coronavirus in the United States . 
" ( I 'm ) not even worried about a second wave . 
I 'm worried about getting out of the situation we 're in right now and saving as many lives as possible and that will be a direct coefficient of how well we comply with social distancing , " Cuomo said . 
The governor said not complying with social distancing would be irresponsible and put a burden on health care workers and first responders . 
" This really is a time where your own individual actions affect other people . 
It can literally kill other people , " he said .
