New York state will employ a " micro cluster " strategy to combat Covid 19 during the fall months , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo announced at a press conference Saturday . 
Cuomo acknowledged that the state will likely see an increase in the transmission rate in the coming months due to schools reopening and cooler weather driving people indoors . 
Additionally , increased rates throughout the country will continue to affect New York , because many people have continued to travel to New York , Cuomo said . 
The " micro cluster " strategy will use enhanced data that the state has been able to collect through increased testing and will enable state authorities to fight Covid 19 on a " block by block " level , rather than on a larger state , region , or county level . 
Cuomo said the state has now been able to collect testing data that is so specific that they are not permitted to show it because it would violate privacy laws . 
However , the data will allow the state to target Covid 19 clusters to the block ( s ) where it is originating , and therefore allow for targeted mitigation and enforcement efforts , he said . 
By fighting " micro clusters " at the block level , rather than at a larger state or county level , mitigation efforts will cause less disruption to other areas with low transmission rates , Cuomo said . 
When a " micro cluster " is identified , the state will ramp up testing , mitigation , and social distancing enforcement in those specific areas , Cuomo said , adding that this approach would continue even after a vaccine becomes available .
