New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo also said the state has now reached the lowest hospitalization rate since the pandemic started . 
Cuomo said he would announce the state 's full coronavirus numbers later today , but told CNN ’s Alisyn Camerota that there were 996 hospitalizations and 17 deaths across the state as of today . 
The governor also said that travelers will be fined if they violate the travel advisory issued by his state — along with New Jersey and Connecticut — that requires people arriving from states with high coronavirus rates to quarantine for 14 days . 
" People , at the end of the day , they get it now . 
It took them too long to get it , but this country gets it now , " he added . 
Cuomo responded to criticism from political leaders such as Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis , who had mandated a 14 day quarantine for travelers from the New York area back in March . 
" The people who played politics now are causing this nation great havoc . 
You 're seeing it all across the country . 
You 're seeing the deaths numbers going up . 
We 'll lose tens of thousands more Americans . 
It 's a real American tragedy that we 're living through right now , " he said .
