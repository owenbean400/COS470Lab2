Nearly 180,000 Americans will die from coronavirus by October 1 unless just about everyone starts wearing masks , new projections show . 
The latest coronavirus projection from the University of Washington â€™s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation shows 179,106 deaths by October 1 if nothing changes . 
But that number would drop to 146,000 if 95 % of Americans started wearing masks in public , the model forecasts . 
The previous IHME forecast , published June 15 , projected 201,129 deaths by October 1 . 
" California and other states have seen over the past several weeks increasing case numbers , but deaths are not yet rising at the same rate , a trend which could change in the coming weeks , " IHME director Christopher Murray said in a statement Wednesday . 
According to a June 12 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 74 % of Americans nationwide said they wore masks often or always . 
That number approached 90 % in New York and Los Angeles . 
" States reporting the ages of confirmed cases suggest there are more cases being detected in younger people who are at substantially lower risk of death than older people , " Murray said . 
" It remains to be seen how this will unfold over the next few weeks , and if transmission continues to go up , we may see increasing infections in at risk populations . "
