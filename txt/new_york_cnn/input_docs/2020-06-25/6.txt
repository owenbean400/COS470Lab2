Former New York Yankee and 14 time all star Alex Rodriguez laid out the challenges Major League Baseball players will face this summer as they take on an abbreviated 60 game season under strict new rules designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus . 
" Think about a world , you going into the office it 's like not being able to use your computer or even email someone , " he continued . 
" It 's going to be a very strange season . " 
The new rules , laid out in a 113 page manual , ban spitting , arguing with umpires , fighting , public transportation to the stadium and communal food spreads among other comforts , according to the New York Times . 
Players and coaches will undergo frequent coronavirus testing and pitchers must use a wet rag in their pocket to dampen the ball for grip instead of spit . 
Speaking with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , Rodriguez pointed out that this abbreviated season also might require vastly more baseballs for sanitary reasons than previous seasons . 
" What 's interesting to note is a Major League Baseball game , you usually have nine to 11 dozens of baseballs . 
â€¦ We live in a world today that we could go through 30 or 40 dozens of baseballs because anytime a ball touches anyone , you throw it out of play , " he said .
