China 's central bank has implemented a new strategy to contain the coronavirus -- deep cleaning and destroying potentially infected cash . 
The virus appears to survive for at least several hours on surfaces , according to the World Health Organization . 
This is why buildings in affected areas are regularly disinfecting elevator buttons , door handles , and other commonly touched surfaces -- and why people are worried about cash , which changes hands multiple times a day . 
New measures : Chinese banks must now disinfect their cash with ultraviolet light and high temperatures , then store it for seven to 14 days before releasing it to customers , said the central Chinese government in a news release . 
Cash that comes from high risk infection areas , like hospitals and wet markets , will be " specially treated " and sent back to the central bank instead of being recirculated . 
And in the central bank 's Guangzhou branch , these high risk banknotes may be destroyed instead of merely disinfected , according to state run tabloid Global Times . 
To make up for the supply , the bank will issue large amounts of new cash ; in January , the bank allocated 4 billion yuan ( $ 573 million ) in new banknotes to Wuhan , the Chinese city where the outbreak began , said the government news release . 
How dirty is cash ? 
Each bill , passed person to person , samples a bit of the environment it comes from , and passes those bits to the next person . 
The list of things found on US dollar bills includes DNA from our pets , traces of drugs , and bacteria and viruses , according to a 2017 study in New York . 
That does not mean cash is dangerous to our health ; disease transmission linked to money is rare , and no major disease outbreaks have started from our ATMs . 
But with new coronavirus cases being reported every day in China , the country 's officials are taking no chances .
