The Metropolitan Transit Authority ( MTA ) , which runs the New York City subway system , has used $ 2.9 billion of the March funding from the Federal CARES Act which represents about 73 % of the money , but expects to exhaust the remaining funding in early July . 
" The MTA is facing the most acute financial crisis in its history , " MTA Chief Financial Officer Bob Foran said in a press release . 
He continued : " With more than 70 % of the CARES funding provided in the first relief package drawn down , and all CARES funding expected to be exhausted early next month , our finances are on life support . " 
He called on Congress to act to protect the MTA " We need the Senate to take action now and follow the House of Representatives ’ leadership on continued pandemic funding . 
As the MTA is the lifeblood of New York and the nation ’s economy – our financial health will be critical to the country ’s economic recovery , " he said . 
Foran added , " New York is also the top donor state in the nation providing $ 29 billion more in funding than we get back from the federal government . " 
The latest ridership numbers : The MTA says more than 2 million people rode New York City subways and buses on Friday , the first time ridership has reached that level since the start of the Covid 19 pandemic in March . 
While it ’s a significant increase in ridership , it ’s a decline of 74 % from normal weekday ridership levels of 7.6 million , the MTA added .
