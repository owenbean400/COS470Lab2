The US Food and Drug Administration said it has sent a warning letter to North Isle Wellness Center in New York and is advising consumers not to purchase products the company has misleadingly claimed work as a treatment for Covid 19 , according to an agency release sent out Monday . 
The FDA gave the company 48 hours to take immediate corrective action and fix its website , product labels and any other labeling and promotional material . 
The company ’s website falsely says its Methylene Blue product " shields against coronavirus , " according to the FDA . 
North Isle Wellness Center claims its product works by producing a " hydrogen peroxide burst within the blood to kill the coronavirus on contact . " 
The company also falsely claims that its skin tonic can build up the immune system in a patient with Covid 19 , and kill the virus on contact . 
There are no FDA approved products to prevent or treat Covid 19 . 
The FDA said it will place North Isle Wellness Center on its health fraud and scams list until there is corrective action . 
Failure to comply , the FDA said , could result in legal action . 
As of Monday afternoon , there was no mention of any coronavirus treatment on North Isle Wellness ’ site .
