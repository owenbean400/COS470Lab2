New York City is usually packed and busy around this time of year . 
It 's finally the beginning of spring ; the streets , parks , and restaurants are usually full of people , even on a weeknight . 
Instead , on Monday night , restaurants and cafes were empty as people stayed home . 
Many of the stores and cafes were closed , with signs on the doors saying they would reopen at a later point . 
Even the restaurants that were still open were mostly empty and eerie . 
Outside , there were few people on the street -- perhaps a sign that New Yorkers are listening to health officials ' pleas for social distancing .
