Europe is drowning in the second wave of the coronavirus epidemic . 
Infection rates are skyrocketing across the continent . 
Governments are imposing strict lockdowns . 
Economies are shutting down again . 
But there is a glimmer of hope : The virus , while still deadly , appears to be killing fewer people on average . 
Recent case and fatality figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) show that while recorded Covid 19 cases are spiking in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , Germany and other European countries , deaths are not rising at the same rate . 
Oke has been tracking Covid 19 fatality rates along with his colleague Carl Heneghan of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine and health economist Daniel Howdon . 
Their research shows that , at the end of June , the fatality rate was just below 3 % in the UK . 
By August , it had dropped as low as about 0.5 % . 
It now stands at roughly 0.75 % . 
" We think it 's probably driven a lot by age , but also other factors , like treatment , " Oke said . 
The lower death rate is not unique to Europe . 
In New York , the death rate for those hospitalized with coronavirus related illnesses has also dropped since earlier this year , according to a study by a team of researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine , published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine . 
A wider analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the NYU team shows that across the United States , " 6.7 % of cases resulted in death in April , compared with 1.9 % in September . "
