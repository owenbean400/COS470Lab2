New York state is looking to open up another drive through coronavirus testing facility , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said in a press call this morning . 
On Friday , roughly 150 vehicles went through the New Rochelle drive through facility in what Cuomo described as the first public drive through coronavirus testing facility on the east coast " The way the drive in works is a person calls first and discusses their situation to fit our protocol , and they then get an appointment and they have a time to show up , " the governor said . 
" We had set 15 minutes per car . 
The actual performance was a car was being done in less than 15 minutes , which was good news . 
It means we can process more people faster than we had originally anticipated , " Cuomo added .
