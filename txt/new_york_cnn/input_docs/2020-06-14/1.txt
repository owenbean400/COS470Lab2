New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said they have received reports from across the state that there are large gatherings , social distancing is being violated , and people are not wearing masks . 
He said the state has received 25,000 complaints of businesses that are in violation of the reopening plan . 
Manhattan and the Hamptons are " the leading areas in the state with violations , " the governor said . 
" We have never received more complaints in a shorter period of time , " he added . 
He continued : " What ’s alarming about the 25,000 is the volume but it also shows how smart people and how offended people are that they are complaining . " 
He said this is particularly true at bars and restaurants . 
" This is a question of violating the law . " 
Cuomo ran through the consequences to explain the gravity of the situation . 
A bar or restaurant can lose their liquor license for violating the rules , " that is a big deal , " he adds " we ’re not kidding around . " 
Inspectors and task force members are enforcing this , Cuomo said , adding he called a couple of bars and restaurants himself after he saw images from within . 
" You ’re playing with your license , " he said he told them . 
An individual cannot violate the open container law as well , he added . 
" You cant stand on the sidewalk drinking a beer , you ’re violating the open container law , " He also advised local governments that failure to govern will result in closures . 
Earlier he said " It is our behavior , nothing more nothing less , " that determines the future of reopening . 
" When all the numbers are good , those numbers can change in a week . "
