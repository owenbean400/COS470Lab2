New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the state reported 23 more deaths from Covid 19 , the " lowest number ever . " 
He explained that when the number gets this low it ’s basically a question of how people are recording the cause of death across the nation because there may be situations where a person dies from multiple causes — Covid , cancer or heart disease , etc . " " We breathe a deep sigh of relief today , " Cuomo said , adding that the death count , among all the numbers , is the " one number we ca not fix . " 
" On the numbers we are making really great progress " he added . 
He called today , " another great day in terms of achievement by New Yorkers . " 
Hospitalizations are at its lowest point since the " horrific " journey began , he said . 
He added that Staten Island had an uptick in percentage of positive cases which he said could be an " aberration " but adds , " we ’re watching it . "
