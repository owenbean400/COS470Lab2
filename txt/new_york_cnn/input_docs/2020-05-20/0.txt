This week , high school and college seniors across the United States are graduating -- a major milestone that looks a little different during a global pandemic . 
Many schools are holding virtual events or drive through celebrations , or postponing their ceremonies until later in the summer in hopes of having them in person . 
But some schools are finding safe ways to make sure the show goes on . 
One high school in Indiana , located close to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , will be handing out diplomas to seniors at the racetrack 's finish line . 
Each student and their family will be allowed one car , in which they will get to drive onto the speedway and get out at the finish line . 
For many college seniors , the process looks more stressful : they are graduating into a labor market that 's been devastated by Covid 19 . 
But for a few days , they get to celebrate the end of their student careers , and the culmination of years of hard work . 
Many seniors returned to their campuses and dormitories this week , wearing face masks and gowns to take graduation photos -- a rite of passage . 
Other students held small gatherings to carry out graduation rituals , like jumping into school fountains and toasting champagne . 
In New York , following annual tradition , the Empire State Building was lit up purple on Tuesday night in celebration of New York University 's graduation . 
Tomorrow , it will be lit blue and white for Columbia University 's graduation .
