New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said reopening the economy requires a metaphorical bridge . 
" Where we 're going , it 's not a reopening in that we 're going to open what was . 
We are going to a different place , " Cuomo said in his daily coronavirus briefing . 
" And we should go to a different place and we should go to a better place . 
If we do not learn the lessons from this situation , then all of this will have been in vain . " 
Cuomo said people need to be prepared for a " new normal " as the situation continues to evolve . 
" We 're going to have a new normal in public health â€¦ the way we have a new normal in the environment , a new normal in economics , a new normal in civil rights , a new normal in social justice , right ? 
This is the way of the world now . 
We 're moving to a new place , more challenging place , but also potentially a better place , " he said . 
Cuomo said the coronavirus threat wo not be fully over until there is a vaccine .
