Most of the pregnant women in New York who tested positive for the novel coronavirus -- one in eight -- were asymptomatic at time of delivery , according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday . 
The research was conducted between March 22 and April 4 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Allen Hospital . 
The center put a universal testing policy in place for all women admitted for delivery after the medical centers had two novel coronavirus cases confirmed among their patient population . 
Asymptomatic cases suggest universal testing important : Of the 215 pregnant women who delivered at these hospitals , four who tested positive for Covid 19 when they were admitted for delivery had a fever or some other symptoms of the coronavirus . 
There were 29 others who tested positive for Covid 19 but did not have fever or any other symptoms of the disease . 
The authors argue that this research shows that there are real potential benefits to conducting a universal test on patients . 
Knowing if someone is infectious would help the hospital determine where to place the patients so they wo not get other people sick , and would help guide the hospital â€™s decisions on what personal protective equipment the staff may need .
