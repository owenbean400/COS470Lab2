The surgery chair of a New York City hospital says more patients are departing than arriving . 
Dr . Craig Smith of the New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center also said the number of patients in the Intensive Care Unit and on ventilators appears to be leveling off at two hospitals that are bearing the brunt of those cases . 
Smith wrote these details in a daily note to faculty and staff . 
There are also fewer autopsies : Smith said autopsies have become uncommon in most settings , and notes " phone consent is not considered acceptable " He added : " Because phone consent is not considered acceptable -- a significant hurdle when visitors are not allowed . 
We are pursuing solutions to that unintended consequence of an administrative policy that was less often objectionable pre pandemic . "
