New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo announced that the state 's Health Department has developed its own coronavirus antibody test . 
Cuomo added that the state is pursuing Food and Drug Administration approval that " could get us to 100,000 people per day . 
To give you an idea , that 's then 500,000 a week . " 
Some context : Antibody tests — also known as serology tests — are not meant to diagnose active coronavirus infections . 
Rather , they check for proteins in the immune system , known as antibodies , through a blood sample . 
Their presence means a person was exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it , which may mean that person has at least some immunity — although experts are not sure how strong the immunity may be or even how long it will last .
