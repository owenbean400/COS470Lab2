A growing number of children are showing up at New York hospitals with troubling new symptoms that state health officials believe could be linked to coronavirus . 
In an advisory to health care providers , state officials said 64 children in New York have been hospitalized with a condition doctors described as " pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome . " 
Some of the children had persistent fever , toxic shock syndrome and features similar to Kawasaki disease , the state health advisory said . 
Kawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart . 
While it 's usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems , it can also be deadly . 
It mainly affects children under the age of five .
