US airports were packed with travelers and expats returning from around the world over the weekend , causing long queues amid enhanced health screenings . 
Travelers complained that they are being made to wait for hours in close quarters at US airports to get screened for coronavirus . 
Passengers arriving at Dallas , Chicago and New York all described long lines and confusion . 
At one New York airport , two travelers said they were alarmed when officials suggested they should share pens to fill out customs and medical forms . 
In a statement Sunday night , US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said wait times for travelers returning from Europe should now decrease after more staff were brought in at major airports . 
He said that screening process logistics had also been " refined . " 
" Implementing these measures helped reduce the wait times , " he said .
