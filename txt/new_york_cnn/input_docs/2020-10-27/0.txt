Ultrasound scans of seriously ill coronavirus patients show many have serious types of structural damage to their hearts , researchers reported Monday . 
And that damage appears to raise their risk of dying . 
The researchers found a startling number of patients hospitalized with Covid 19 had heart damage and said the ultrasound scans might help doctors start early treatment to help them recover better . 
Fuster and colleagues at hospitals across the Mt . Sinai system in New York , plus at a hospital in Italy , looked at the scans -- called echocardiograms -- of 305 Covid 19 patients in the hospital for treatment . 
Nearly two thirds of them -- 190 patients -- had structural heart damage , the team reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . 
Records showed 118 already had heart damage when they were admitted and another 72 developed injuries while they were being treated in the hospital . 
Doctors routinely run a blood test checking levels of a protein called troponin in coronavirus patients . 
Higher levels indicate damage to the heart muscle . 
But the researchers found the ultrasounds gave a much better indication of which patients were at highest risk of death . 
Hospitalized coronavirus patients who did not have elevated troponin levels had a 5 % rate of death in the study . 
Those with elevated troponin whose hearts looked normal in ultrasound scans had an 18.6 % rate of death . 
But those who had high troponin levels and whose hearts showed physical abnormalities on ultrasound scans had a nearly 32 % rate of death , the researchers said .
