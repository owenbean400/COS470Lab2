New York City schools will remain open Tuesday , as the city ’s seven day test positivity rate remains under 3 % , Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a televised interview with MSNBC . 
The seven day average test positivity rate as of Monday morning is 2.77 % , he said . 
If the test positivity rate reached or exceeded 3 % , city schools could be closed and students would move to all remote learning , the city previously announced . 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo has publicly suggested that schools across New York City should be allowed to " test out " of closing as Covid 19 rates continue to rise across the city . 
Schools should also be able to " test out of a red zone " areas around the state , where infection levels are 4 % or higher , Cuomo said . 
Remember : The positivity rate is the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested . 
So , as more and more people are being tested , the focus is shifting to the positivity rate — how many of those tested are actually infected .
