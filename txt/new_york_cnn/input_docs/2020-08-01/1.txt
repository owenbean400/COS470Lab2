Health experts have cautioned against reopening in areas across the US where Covid 19 transmission levels are still high . 
Emergency medicine physician Dr . Daniel Fagbuyi said Saturday that planning is key when considering reopening . 
He recommends communities consider reopening once they have met certain requirements , including reaching a positivity rate less than 5 % , mandating face masks , and implementing rapid testing , social distancing and regular hand washing . 
Fagbuyi noted that the measures " seem basic , but if you do not have any of these all in place at the same time , there 's always a loophole , and once you have a loophole , it 's game over . " 
In this case , " game over " can be fatal . 
Experts say considering these potential consequences of reopening can be helpful . 
Saag said leaders have to be willing to act on plans that are made . 
" Once a plan is made , the implementation has to follow in lockstep , " said Saag . 
" If it does not , we should be expecting cases in schools , and it wo not be news that somebody in Mississippi or somebody in another school system became infected . " 
Hotez recommended waiting for coronavirus cases to reach containment in states before schools reopen . 
Saag noted that New York â€™s cases dropped to near pre epidemic levels before they considered reopening schools . 
Cuomo said Saturday that even in New York , parents are understandably concerned . 
Saag noted that it 's a tough decision , " The question is , what are we willing to live with ? "
