Sarah Maslin Nir is a New York Times reporter who was covering the coronavirus pandemic before she tested positive herself . 
She said the United States has less stringent guidelines on how long you have to quarantine after you test positive . 
In New York state , you can leave the house three days after your last symptom , Maslin Nir said . 
" China requires two post symptomatic tests within 48 hours that show you have no coronavirus , and then 14 more days of quarantine . 
So I 'm following China 's guidelines and still considering myself quarantined , " she said . 
Now that she has recovered , she said she wants people to understand how easy it is to spread the virus . 
Even those who are asymptomatic infect about 2.2 other people on average , according to Maslin Nir . 
" It 's not suicidal to go out into the world . 
It 's homicidal behavior . 
I truly believe that people should take incredible precautions , " she said .
