A 4 year old Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York tested positive for coronavirus , which causes Covid 19 in humans . 
This is the first instance of a tiger being infected , according to the US Department of Agriculture â€™s National Veterinary Services Laboratories . 
The tiger , named Nadia , along with her sister Azul , two Amur tigers and three African lions " had developed a dry cough and all are expected to recover , " a news release from the zoo said . 
Samples from Nadia were taken and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed symptoms of respiratory illness , the USDA said in a release . 
The zoo said the big cats were infected by a person caring for them who was either asymptomatic or had not yet developed symptoms . 
" Appropriate preventive measures are now in place for all staff who are caring for them , and the other cats in our four WCS zoos , to prevent further exposure of any other of our zoo cats , " the release said .
