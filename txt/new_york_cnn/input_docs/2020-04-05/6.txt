New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said the health care system is facing operational challenges due to hospitals being over capacity . 
He said hospitals are being asked to manage the same amount of staff and resources . 
" That is putting a tremendous amount of stress on the health care system , " Cuomo said . 
" You 're asking a system to do more than it has ever done before , more than it was designed to do with less . " 
He said the way to get through it is to use a surge and flex the system to balance the patient load between private and public hospitals in the area .
