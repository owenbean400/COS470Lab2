Defense Secretary Mark Esper said " many " ventilators to be used in the coronavirus response have " deployed with the USNS Comfort and Mercy in New York and Los Angeles , respectively . " 
Esper said " we 're probably sitting on a few hundred , " ventilators that have still not shipped as they wait for requests to send the remaining ventilators once other federal stocks are depleted . 
Some context : Despite having committed to transferring 2,000 ventilators in military stocks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services to fight the coronavirus outbreak , the Pentagon had not shipped any of them as of this past Tuesday because the agencies have not asked for them or provided a shipping location , the Pentagon 's top logistics official said during a briefing last week .
