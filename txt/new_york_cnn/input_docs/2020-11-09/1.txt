New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said rates of coronavirus infection are expected to rise as winter approaches , and warned that micro clusters will be " the constant for the foreseeable future . " 
Cuomo said " the numbers are undeniable across the globe , across the country . " 
He said that overall , New York state was " doing much better than any state in the country , " save for rural states such as Vermont and Maine , with a lower " relative index . " 
New York reported a positivity rate of 2.8 % , 26 new deaths and 1,400 hospitalizations on Monday . 
The positivity rate was last at 2.5 % in early June . 
Cuomo said that watching a small increase and attacking that area was the best mode of operation . 
In Brooklyn , red zones will be " eliminated " and become lower tier orange zones . 
He said the numbers in Staten Island were of concern , but that no restrictions would be implemented at this time . 
Cuomo said parts of Eerie County , Monroe County , and Onondaga County would become " yellow zones , " with restrictions including a 25 person maximum for gatherings , four person maximum for dining , and bars and restaurants closing at midnight .
