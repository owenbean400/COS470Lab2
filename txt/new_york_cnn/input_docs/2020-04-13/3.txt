Dr . Melanie Malloy has one of the toughest jobs out there right now . 
She is an attending physician at Mount Sinai Brooklyn hospital and spends her days in the emergency department treating the scores of desperately sick patients who flood in with Covid 19 . 
The hospital , which is relatively small , has been inundated with more than 1,250 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began , pushing the hospital to 150 % of its capacity at one point . 
In a sense , she is one of the luckier New York health workers — her hospital still has enough personal protective equipment and ventilators . 
But her shifts are long and brutal , and the challenges do not stop when she goes home . 
Malloy is also a widow , raising three children on her own . 
CNN asked Malloy to make a video diary taking us through her day as she struggles to save others ’ lives while protecting her own .
