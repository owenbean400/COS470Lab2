New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said recovering from the pandemic is not like flipping a switch on and off . 
Cuomo said he often thinks about when this could be over â€” and he does not know . 
" When is it over ? 
I have this conversation a hundred times a day , " he said , noting that many of the social distancing guidelines go against " human behavior and needs . " 
" It 's not going to be , we flip a switch , " Cuomo said . 
" I would love to say that 's going to happen . 
It 's not going to happen that way . " 
He added : He added that he thinks New York can " start on the path to normalcy . " 
" I want it to be over tomorrow , " Cuomo said . 
" But that 's not reality . " 
Later in the press conference , Cuomo said this would not truly be over until there is a vaccine for Covid 19 , which could be 12 to 18 months .
