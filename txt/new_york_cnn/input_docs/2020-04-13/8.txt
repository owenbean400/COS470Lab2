New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo says he was worried about the coronavirus outbreak spreading from New York City to suburbs upstate .

" And it ’s blowing the fire , and a couple embers wind up on one side of the field and embers start to catch fire and that ’s a cluster , and you have to run over to those embers and stamp them out right away before they grow . "
