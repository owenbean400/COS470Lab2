New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on " The Situation Room " the Trump administration would need to " do a 180 " if it wants to reopen businesses in the country . 
He continued : " They would have to not just proclaim , they would have to say this is how we 're going to do it which we have not heard to date . " 
Cuomo , who has been dealing with the the largest outbreak of coronavirus in the United States in his home state , said most of the responsibility for buying personal protective equipment and ventilators has been left to the states . 
" I ’m not going to say I do not want help from the federal government , I do , " he added . 
" The more the federal government can do , the less I have to do , God bless — but then the federal government has to do it . "
