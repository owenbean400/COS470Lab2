The Pentagon announced a major contract for 60 decontamination units that will allow millions of N95 masks to be reused as the critical masks continue to be sought after by medical professionals amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
The $ 415 million contract will allow for the acquisition of " 60 Battelle Memorial Institute Critical Care Decontamination Systems ( CCDS ) , that can decontaminate up to 80,000 used N95 respirators per system per day , enabling mask reuse up to 20 times , " according to a statement from the Pentagon . 
The Defense Department said six units have already been delivered to multiple US cities including two to New York , and one each to Columbus , Ohio , Boston , Chicago and Tacoma , " providing the ability to sterilize 3.4 million masks a week , reducing the need for new masks by the same number . " 
" All 60 systems will be available by early May for prioritization and distribution by FEMA and HHS . 
Once all are delivered , these 60 units will allow 4.8 million masks to be sterilized per day , almost 34 million per week , " the statement added . 
The location of where the remaining units will be delivered has yet to be determined .
