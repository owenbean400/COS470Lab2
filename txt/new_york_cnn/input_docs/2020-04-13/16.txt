New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy said Monday while positive tests have flattened , they are still " not yet there " in the fight against coronavirus . 
Murphy , who called into a joint news conference with New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo , went on to say the decision to reopen the state should be " based on the facts , the data , the science . " 
The timing , however , has to be right , he added . 
" You could have inadvertent unintended consequences , which could be grave , " Murphy said . 
He added : " This is the fight of our lives . 
Let there be no doubt about it , and we 're not out of the woods yet , and reopening ourselves back up will be equally as challenging , beyond the shadow of a doubt . "
