Lamont thanked Cuomo for getting together the governors . 
He referenced transportation as a main issue , as many from his state commute to New York . 
He noted the " commuter corridor " has become the " Covid corridor , " and stressed that it ’s important to " make sure you do not pull the trigger too early . " 
" Working together makes the most sense , " he added .
