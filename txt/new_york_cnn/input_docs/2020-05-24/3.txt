Dublin Deck Tiki Bar and Grill in Patchogue , New York , apologized on Sunday after Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo ’s office criticized the restaurant for allegedly easing restrictions on masks and social distancing for its customers because of rainy weather on Friday . 
" From what I understand , it was raining on Friday evening and so the bar allowed patrons to come inside to pick up their food , " said Melissa De Rosa , secretary to the governor , adding that was the explanation given to Suffolk County police , who broke up the crowd . 
Restaurants in New York state are currently limited to take out and delivery . 
Photos from inside the bar at the time showed people not wearing masks , De Rosa said . 
" That ’s stupid -- stupid for you , it ’s stupid for your surrounding patrons , it ’s stupid for the bar , " she said . 
" I take them at their word that that ’s what happened , but moving forward , they should be on notice and again , the enforcement is up to the locals . " 
The restaurant later posted an apology on its Instagram story , saying " quick rainfall sent guests inside to the bar area . " 
" There are no excuses when it comes to public safety . 
We should not have allowed anybody inside whatsoever , " the statement said . 
" We apologize to anybody who may have been offended by the videos that surfaced , " it said . 
The Suffolk County Police Department confirmed it responded after " multiple 911 calls " regarding noncompliance at the restaurant . 
The department is " taking reports of noncompliance very seriously , " it said in a statement .
