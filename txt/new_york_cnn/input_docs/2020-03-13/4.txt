The drive through testing facility for coronavirus in New Rochelle , New York , can handle 6 lanes and up to 200 cars a day , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said today . 
He said its " faster , easier " as well as " smarter and safer " especially since this does not expose people who would otherwise go into an office . 
He said officials are prioritizing people in New Rochelle — the New York City suburb which is the site of a containment zone — first as well as vulnerable populations . 
But people all throughout Westchester County can be served . 
The medical staff will take the swabs and send it to Bioreference lab , which will do the testing .
