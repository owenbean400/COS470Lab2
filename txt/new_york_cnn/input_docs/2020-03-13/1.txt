Glossier , the popular direct to consumer beauty brand , plans to temporarily close all its stores and pop up shops in New York , Los Angeles , Atlanta and London . 
The start up will also postpone the opening of a new location in Arizona , which had been slated for next Wednesday . 
CEO Emily Weiss announced the moves in a blog post Friday , saying the closures would take place " for at least the next two weeks to help mitigate the spread of COVID 19 . " 
Store workers will continue to be paid for their scheduled shifts throughout that period , she added . 
The company is not the only one closing its doors for a while as the world grapples with the pandemic . 
Apple and Starbucks have also temporarily suspended operations at some China stores recently , while Italy has ordered all shops across the country to shut down , apart from supermarkets and pharmacies .
