New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said today he spoke to Vice President Mike Pence yesterday and told him , " I think the federal government should decentralize testing , " rather than trying to control it all through Washington , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the Food and Drug Administration . 
The " volume is just too high , " Cuomo said . 
He suggested 500 to 1,000 labs could open overnight if the responsibility is returned back to state . 
There are dozens of labs in NY that could start testing tomorrow , Cuomo said He hopes the federal government takes the recommendation seriously . 
Cuomo has been pushing in recent days that automated tests be approved by the FDA which would significantly increase testing capacity .
