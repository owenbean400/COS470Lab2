It ’s important to build up stockpiles , both nationally and at the state level , as more than 10 states begin to see a resurgence in coronavirus cases , Dr . Anthony Fauci said during a virtual appearance Wednesday at the Sacramento Press Club . 
When the pandemic first started spreading in the United States , the country was not prepared , Fauci said . 
" You know , the stockpile in the beginning was not adequate to really address the major surges received — particularly in the northeast part of the country , in the New York metropolitan area , " he said . 
" But right now we have some time . 
I mean , we 're not where we want to be , because we want to see that curve go way down . 
It has not come down , " he said . 
" Yesterday we had something like 35 or 37,000 new cases of coronavirus disease — new cases . " 
Fauci said at one point the number of new cases was heading in the right direction : down . 
" Now , it ’s not . 
It ’s going back up . " 
Fauci urged states and cities to address the issues of equipment and drug stockpiles , as well as hospital capacity . 
" I think it 's time to start preparing each state . 
I mean the one thing I 've learned not to do , is that you do not go in and tell people what they should do , " he said . 
" We have the possibility of a surge of cases . 
Do we have enough backup to handle them ? 
If we do not , let 's start building it up . "
