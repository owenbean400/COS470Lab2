The Navajo Nation -- a tribal area which spans parts of Arizona , New Mexico and Utah -- has issued a health advisory to 21 new communities warning residents of the " uncontrolled spread " of Covid 19 , according to a statement . 
The Native American territory now has 34 communities under a 14 day advisory for Covid 19 spread , the statement added . 
Residents in the impacted communities are " advised to stay on the Navajo Nation and refrain from off Reservation travel , " a public health order from the Navajo Department of Health said . 
Navajo leaders said in the statement that the increase in the uncontrolled spread of Covid 19 is " largely due to travel off the Navajo Nation and family gatherings . " 
As a result , the nation will implement a 56 hour curfew starting at 9pm on Friday November 13 , the statement explained . 
The Navajo Nation was once a prominent hot spot for Covid 19 in the US . 
In May , the nation surpassed New York and New Jersey for the highest per capita Coronavirus infection rate . 
Nez cited multi generation living situations , a lack of running water among residents and fewer places to purchase food as causes for increased spread of the disease in May .
