Pfizer 's announcement that its Covid 19 vaccine appears to be more than 90 % effective was a " great milestone " but only a " first step , " Dr . Stephen Thomas , chief of infectious disease at SUNY Upstate Medical University in New York and lead principal investigator of Pfizer 's Upstate Covid 19 trial site , said on CNN Right Now . 
Before the US Food and Drug Administration can issue an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) for any vaccine , the manufacturers must show it works safely and as intended . 
He estimated that there will be an answer before the end of the year from the FDA , but warned that things may slow after that . 
That process will take months and many experts , from top levels of government down , say it â€™s unlikely that most Americans will get vaccines before spring at the very soonest .
