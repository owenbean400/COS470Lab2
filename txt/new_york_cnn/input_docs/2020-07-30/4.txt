Without appropriate and streamlined federal action , reopening hotels has been difficult , says Jonathan Tisch , Chairman and CEO of Loews Hotels . 
However , the surge in different parts of the country and changing local rulings and guidance has not provided for a climate where people want to travel , he said , adding that the debate over reopening schools is also going to impact the travel industry . 
In a letter to government officials , 13 travel industry CEOs are asking for tax credits for individual travel , a reintroduction of the business meals deduction , liability waivers , among other things for economic assistance , Tisch said . 
" Some 16 million dedicated men and women used to make a living in the travel and tourism industry . 
Our industry is running at 50 % unemployment , " he said . 
" There 's an estimate that 1 % of all hotel rooms in the country , some 60,000 hotel rooms , could be wiped out . 
The number in New York where we run our business from is worse . 
There 's an estimate that has 20 % of the hotel rooms in New York City could be wiped out . " 
He added that the industry needs help in many ways so industry workers can come back to " provide a service that 's appreciated by our guests . "
