Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday he disagrees with " well meaning governors " who plan on performing state level safety reviews of coronavirus vaccines after they are authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . 
New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo has said that New York health officials will review a coronavirus vaccine after it is approved by the FDA to ensure its safety . 
Fauci told PBS News Hour ’s Judy Woodruff he understands that governors want to protect their citizens , but with the mixed signals coming out of Washington , they ’re missing something important about the vaccine approval process . 
Fauci said he wants everyone to understand there is no political pressure affecting the vaccine approval process . 
" I hope that they would then realize that that 's good enough , " he said . 
Fauci added that if everything goes well , vaccinations will likely begin in December and the US will be able to start vaccinating the broader population " in earnest " in April and May .
