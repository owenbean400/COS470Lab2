In person instruction at the State University of New York ( SUNY ) Oneonta has been suspended for two weeks after a coronavirus cluster developed at the school . 
The Governor of New York , Andrew Cuomo , said he had deployed a SWAT team of 71 contact tracers and 8 case investigators to address the outbreak . 
Cuomo said the state is also setting up 3 free rapid testing sites in the city , which will be open to all residents . 
The site locations will be announced Monday . 
" We have had reports of several large parties of our students at Oneonta last week and unfortunately , because of those larger gatherings , there were several students who were symptomatic of COVID and upon testing we found that 20 were positive for the COVID virus , " said SUNY Oneanta chancellor Jim Malatras . 
Five students in Oneonta have been suspended for holding parties against college policy , Malatras said . 
Additionally , three campus organizations have been suspended . 
New York State guidance dictates that schools must go to " remote learning with limited on campus activity for two weeks when 5 percent or 100 individuals test positive for COVID 19 within a two week period , " the Governor said in a press release .
