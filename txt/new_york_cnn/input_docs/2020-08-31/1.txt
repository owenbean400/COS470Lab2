New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo , along with several unions , is sending a letter to the New York congressional delegation today pleading for federal funding to address budget shortfalls . 
" There is no way that the states and the local governments can cover the deficit . 
There is no combination of savings , efficiencies , tax increases that could ever come near covering the deficit , " said Cuomo Monday . 
Among the budget shortfalls is $ 30 billion for New York state and $ 9 billion for New York City .
