A large party is suspected as the origin for a coronavirus outbreak at New York 's SUNY Oneonta , which has led to a halt on in person classes for at least two weeks . 
Dozens of students have been suspended for violating the code of conduct , chancellor Jim Malatras told CNN 's John King . 
" Socializing is great , but we have to do this differently . 
We have to control this virus . 
And I ’m going to keep reinforcing that but also enforcing discipline because we ca not have this get out of control across the state , " he said . 
" We noticed that there was a large party early last week . 
It resulted in several Covid cases . 
Twenty Covid cases became 105 cases . 
We stepped in immediately , " Malatras said , adding that SUNY ’s upstate medical facility is doing 75,000 tests a week through the SUNY system . 
The outbreak shows that the pandemic is not over yet , Malatras added . 
It ’s day one on the job for Malatras , who previously worked on New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo ’s panel of advisers to combat the coronavirus crisis . 
Cuomo will send in a team of 70 contact tracers and eight case investigators in an attempt to contain the outbreak . 
To reinforce the messaging and discipline on campus , Malatras said he will focus on how everyone plays a role in this pandemic .
