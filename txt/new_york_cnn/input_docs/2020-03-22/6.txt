Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that New York received no funding from the first coronavirus bill despite it " having the greatest need . " 
Hospital beds and medical supplies continue to be an issue for the state , Cuomo added . 
Hospitals have about 53,000 hospital beds available now , but could need around 110,000 , he said . 
Cuomo is calling on the federal government to nationalize medical supply acquisitions because states are competing with each other and price gauging is happening . 
New York state has 15 times more cases than other states , according to Cuomo .
