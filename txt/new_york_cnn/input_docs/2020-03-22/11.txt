A health care system in New York is no longer allowing visitors , including partners , for its patients about to give birth , citing coronavirus risk . 
Goffman described the move as a " very difficult decision and not one taken lightly . " 
New York Presbyterian has also made the decision to test all women in labor who are admitted to labor and delivery units for Covid 19 , regardless of symptoms . 
Goffman said there had been a number of patients with little to no symptoms upon admission , and others with atypical symptoms , who were later found to test positive for the novel coronavirus . 
Moreover , " many symptoms of labor and of pregnant women really mimic some of the symptoms of Covid 19 , " including fatigue and shortness of breath , she added . 
" As a result , these women were not identified by our usual screening , infection prevention and control , or testing processes , and therefore our practices for protection for Covid 19 were not implemented . 
In this case , many staff members were exposed , " Goffman said . 
Testing women in labor , she added , would allow doctors to isolate newborns who may have been exposed to the virus , thus preventing outbreaks in neonatal ICUs and well baby nurseries . 
Absent in person visitors for these patients , Goffman said the hospital system was looking into ways to allow families to participate virtually in childbirth , perhaps through tablet computers . 
" We recognize that we will need to provide additional support for moms , as well as mom and baby pairs , as they 're in the hospital through the duration of their stay , " she said .
