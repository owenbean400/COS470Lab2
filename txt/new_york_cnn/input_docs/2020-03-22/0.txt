The United State 's emergency stimulus package will help the workers hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said . 
Schumer told CNN â€™s Wolf Blizter on The Situation Room on Saturday night that a tentpole of the stimulus package was putting " workers first " by giving them " unemployment insurance on steroids . " 
Under this scheme , Schumer noted that workers would be " furloughed by their employer so that you can go back to work . " 
About 75 million residents of Connecticut , Illinois , New York and California have been ordered to remain at home to slow the spread of coronavirus .
