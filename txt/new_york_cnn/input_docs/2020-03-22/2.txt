Major events around the world have been canceled or postponed as the race to contain the novel coronavirus continues . 
The cultural sector -- with its numerous fairs , shows and festivals -- has also been significantly impacted . 
What has been affected : Countless art institutions , museums and galleries have been temporarily shuttered . 
The Louvre in Paris , which houses the famous " Mona Lisa , " is closed until further notice . 
A blockbuster exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Italian Renaissance painter Raphael was suspended days after opening in Rome . 
Organizers have pulled the plug on Glastonbury , the UK 's largest music festival , which was celebrating its 50th anniversary . 
In New York , the lights are out on Broadway , with performances canceled until mid April . 
Fashion 's biggest night , The Met Gala , has been postponed . 
Why this is a big deal : Of course , such closures can seem immaterial compared to the public health crisis posed by Covid 19 and its rising death toll .
