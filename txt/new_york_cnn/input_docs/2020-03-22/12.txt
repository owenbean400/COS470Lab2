New York police officers will by patrolling on foot and by vehicle Sunday night , watching for crowds of people and informing them about the statewide stay at home order . 
Their role will be more about education , than enforcement , a law enforcement official tells CNN . 
Officers at each precinct will have a list of hot spots , stores and other locations in their sectors where people are known to congregate . 
They â€™ll keep an eye out for groups of people and if spotted , they will tell them to disperse , the official said . 
The law enforcement official told CNN that if groups refuse to disperse , there wo not be arrests . 
Rather , officers will try to convince them that they need to leave and not be so close together , the official said . 
There are not enough patrol cars , so some officers will be on foot , canvassing the neighborhoods . 
So far , officers have had a big presence at supermarkets and food shops , making sure crowds are under control , but not having any overcrowding issues so far , the official said . 
The NYPD currently has 98 employees , 70 uniformed and 28 civilian workers , who have tested positive for the coronavirus .
