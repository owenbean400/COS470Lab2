The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has screened more than 2,000 travelers to the US , about 200 flights , for Wuhan coronavirus as of Thursday . 
It has not found any cases of the virus among those travelers , but one person was sent to the hospital for additional medical evaluation . 
The CDC recently began health screenings for travelers from Wuhan at five airports : John F . Kennedy International Airport in New York , Los Angeles International Airport , San Francisco International Airport , Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Chicago O 'Hare International Airport . 
On Friday , the CDC noted that both confirmed US patients were asymptomatic and fever free when they arrived in the United States , although they arrived before airport screenings were in place . 
As China has restricted travel for millions , the CDC is evaluating how to proceed with entry screenings . 
" Those circumstances have clearly changed and so we are re evaluating that approach , " Dr . Martin Cetron , director of the CDC 's division of global migration and quarantine , said Friday . 
This comes a day after the CDC raised its travel notice for Wuhan to its highest level , recommending " that travelers avoid all nonessential travel " to the central China city .
