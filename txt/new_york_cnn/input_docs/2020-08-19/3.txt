Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo wants all New York state school districts to look at their reopening plans to see how they would handle a coronavirus outbreak similar to the one currently seen at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana . 
Cuomo wants to know if school reopening plans would be able to catch the spread before an outbreak can get as big as the one currently seen at Notre Dame . 
" if you ca not answer yes then there is a problem , " Cuomo said . 
During a call with reporters , Cuomo suggested that an outbreak in a K 12 school would be more problematic than an outbreak at a college . 
" Frankly , on a college it ’s not as bad because the student is infecting other students . 
K 12 if you have 130 students positive , it ’s not 130 , it ’s 500 because a student would have gone home and dealt with people In their immediate family , " Cuomo said . 
" The basic point is opening schools is risky and problematic , " Cuomo added . 
Some more context : Notre Dame is seeing a spike in Covid 19 cases since students returned to campus on Aug . 3 . 
As of Tuesday , 147 students have tested positive , according to the school 's online health dashboard .
