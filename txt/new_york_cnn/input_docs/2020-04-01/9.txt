New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo said New York City playgrounds will soon close . 
The decision came after he repeatedly warned young people to follow social distancing guidelines and not congregate in public areas . 
" I 've said this 100 different ways , but compliance is still not where it should be , " Cuomo said . 
" So , we 're going to take more dramatic actions . 
We are going to close down the New York City playgrounds . 
I 've talked about this for weeks . " 
He added that he 's working with Mayor Bill de Blasio on the closures . 
Open areas in parks will stay open , he said .
