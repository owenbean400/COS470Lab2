US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said on the " Today " show that he has been in talks with the head of the national stockpile to come up with a " better way " for states to access the ventilators that are needed to treat some of the sickest Covid 19 patients . 
He continued : " We ’re trying to purchase what we can for the stockpile and send it to places like New York that need it the most , but we ’re also trying to make sure other states and governors can get priority purchasing at a reasonable rate , " Adams said . 
" It ’s one of the things that we ’re working with to try to make sure the equipment can get to where it ’s needed and in an efficient way and without price gouging . "
