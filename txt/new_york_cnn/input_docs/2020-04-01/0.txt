President Trump on Tuesday again touted anti malaria drugs as a potential treatment for coronavirus , and extolled their safety , despite the lack of scientific studies on the matter . 
Facts First : Trump is right that the drugs have been available for a while , but he ’s wrong to imply that they ’ve been proven safe for Covid 19 patients . 
Public health officials have said testing is still needed , and trials are underway . 
Over the weekend , the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for doctors to use the drugs in hospitals for a limited set of Covid 19 cases . 
Some physicians have already been using the malaria drugs off label to treat coronavirus patients . 
The drugs have been used to safely prevent and treat malaria , and for lupus and other conditions . 
But there is not scientific data proving that they ’re safe for coronavirus patients . 
There ’s no evidence to back up Trump ’s assertion that it ’s already known that Covid 19 patients wo not die from the treatment . 
The drug can lead to cardiac side effects , including an irregular heartbeat , which can be especially dangerous for patients with Covid 19 , doctors say . 
Early tests are underway now in New York , the hardest hit area in the US with more than 75,000 cases . 
This is not the first time Trump has made this comment . 
His messaging on the drugs have been far more optimistic than the messaging from the public health officials that have attended the daily White House briefings .
