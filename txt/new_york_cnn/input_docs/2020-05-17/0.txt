Last month , John Lynch of New Jersey said a final goodbye to his father over Face Time . 
Hugh Lynch , who had dementia , died of natural causes at a memory care center in Atlanta on April 13 . 
Because of Covid 19 guidelines restricting visitation to hospitals and care centers , John could not see his father in person before he died . 
It was Lynch 's experience with his father during the pandemic and conversations with medical worker friends that inspired him to take action .
