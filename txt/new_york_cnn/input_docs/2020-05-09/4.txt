Rep . 
Hakeem Jeffries of New York joined Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo during his coronavirus news conference Saturday to discuss how religious organizations around the state are helping to address the pandemic . 
Jeffries commented on a new initiative where Northwell Health is setting up 22 additional coronavirus testing sites at churches in predominantly minority communities . 
" These churches have been there through the crack cocaine epidemic to welcome people in while others were rejecting them . 
Our churches have been there , for instance , to address the high rates of gun violence through gun buyback programs , taking thousands of guns off the streets in their congregations , buildings , " Jeffries said . 
According to surveys and data , of the 21 zip codes with the most hospitalizations for coronavirus , 20 of 21 have greater than average African American and/or Latino populations . 
" There ’s no doubt that it is a problem , " Cuomo said . 
" We understand why , we understand the health disparities , we understand the comorbidities , but we also understand it ’s just not right . "
