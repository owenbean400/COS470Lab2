Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo has reported that the rate of hospitalization across New York has dropped , as has the rate of intubation caused by coronavirus . 
The number of new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours was 572 , Cuomo said at a news conference Saturday morning . 
Since yesterday , the state has recorded 226 coronavirus related deaths , Cuomo said . 
That number is up slightly from the 216 reported on May 7 . 
" And you see how that number has been infuriatingly constant ; 226 is where we were five days ago . 
So we would like to see that number dropping at a far faster rate than it has been dropping , " he said .
