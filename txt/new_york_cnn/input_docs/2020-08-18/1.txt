About one third of New York area businesses would become insolvent without government support if current revenue levels persist , according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Tuesday . 
Thirty four percent of service sector firms said their businesses would become insolvent in an average of eight months . 
And 32 % of manufacturers said they would not be able to survive at current revenue levels without further support from government programs . 
Manufacturers said they would become insolvent in an average of just six months . 
The survey , which included companies based in New York , northern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut , reflects deep concerns from companies about their finances . 
About three quarters of service sector firms and manufacturers said they were either very or somewhat concerned about collecting payments from customers . 
And roughly two thirds said they were very or somewhat concerned about maintaining adequate cash flow . 
Most companies surveyed said they applied for and received Payment Protection Program loans as part of the federal government â€™s stimulus package .
