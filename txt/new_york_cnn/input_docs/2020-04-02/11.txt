New York state will conduct a nightly , hospital by hospital , supply inventory survey to see how each hospital is stocked when it comes to supplies needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo announced today . 
All hospitals are also being asked to contribute supplies they do not currently need to a central stockpile so the state can distribute supplies to hospitals with the greatest need . 
" Rather than having all these regional systems and public systems , private systems , et cetera , we have a central stockpile . 
We are asking all the hospitals to contribute what they have to that central stockpile , and then we will disburse on a need basis , " Cuomo added . 
" You know , some hospitals have more supplies than they 're using . 
We 're saying , do not hoard supplies . 
Let 's put all the supplies in the central stockpile , and then we will draw down from the central stockpile , and we will monitor this literally on a daily basis .
