The Health and Human Services Department said Thursday it used its authority under the Defense Production Act to distribute roughly 192,000 N95 respirator masks and a large haul of other scarce medical supplies that the FBI seized during the arrest of a Brooklyn man . 
These supplies were distributed to healthcare workers in New York and New Jersey , HHS said . 
Baruch Feldheim , 43 , was arrested Monday after he allegedly coughed on FBI agents and told them he had the coronavirus . 
Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Feldheim sold the N95 masks to doctors and nurses at inflated prices ; in one instance at as much as a 700 % markup . 
Justice Department prosecutors in Newark charged him with assaulting federal officers and making false statements to law enforcement . 
Feldheim kept the items in a repair shop in Irvington , New Jersey , which contained enough materials to outfit an entire hospital , a doctor who purchased masks from Feldheim told authorities . 
FBI agents , as part of the Justice Department 's Covid 19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force , seized the items , which in addition to the N95 masks also included : 598,000 medical grade gloves , 130,000 surgical and other masks , surgical gowns , disinfectant towels , particulate filters , and bottles of hand sanitizer and spray disinfectants , the Justice Department and HHS said in a press release .
