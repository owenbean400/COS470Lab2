New York department store chain Century 21 filed for bankruptcy Thursday and said it will shut down its business . 
Century 21 has 13 stores mostly in the New York City and the surrounding metropolitan area . 
The company blamed the lack of payment on its business interruption insurance as the cause of its demise . 
Department store chains large and small were struggling even before the Covid 19 pandemic caused stores to shut temporarily and shift more purchases online . 
Stores that depended on clothing sales , such as Century 21 , have been hit particularly hard as millions of people are out of work and millions more are working from home and not needing to buy as many dress clothes . 
Larger , national department store chains , such as JCPenney , Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor have filed for bankruptcy during the pandemic , with Lord & Taylor announcing its own plans to shut down . 
But Century 21 said the final straw was the fact that it did not get $ 175 million it had filed for under its business interruption insurance . 
It said the policy had saved it in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks â€” it had a store directly across the street from the World Trade Center , which was destroyed . 
But it said it has not been able to get the payment this time .
