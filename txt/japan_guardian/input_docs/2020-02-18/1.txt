The Italian luxury fashion house Prada has postponed a fashion show due to take place in Japan in May . 
In a statement , the company said : Due to the current uncertainty related to the spread of the novel coronavirus , the Prada Resort fashion show originally scheduled for 21 May in Japan will be postponed . 
Prada added the decision was a precautionary measure as well as " an act of responsibility and respect " for all those working on and planning to attend the show . 
The statement continued : " Japan remains one of Prada ’s strategic markets and relevant events will be scheduled in the country at a more appropriate moment . " 
Both Japan and South Korea have reported entering a " new phase " of the coronavirus outbreak , with the Japanese prime minister , Shinzo Abe , saying the situation is changing " minute by minute " in the country . 
The number of cases in Japan now stands at 607 , with 542 on the stranded Princess Diamond cruise ship and 65 elsewhere in the country . 
There has been one reported death . 
Most worryingly , there has been an increase in the number of cases where the Japanese health ministry has been unable to figure out the origin of the transmission . 
The Mainichi newspaper reports that a spate of new cases is being linked to a New Year ’s party for taxi drivers held on a river tour boat in the capital . 
It reports that as of 16 February , 11 attendees and boat employees were infected with coronavirus .
