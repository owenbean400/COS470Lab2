Officials in Hubei province , the centre of the coronavirus outbreak , will adopt more thorough and forceful measures to find patients with fever , state media reported today . 
Records of all fever patients who have visited a doctor since 20 January will be checked , as well as the records of those who have bought over the counter cough and fever medications in shops and online , Xinhua reported . 
People will get health check ups and , if necessary , be placed in quarantine or taken to hospital , the report added , citing a notice from the province â€™s epidemic control headquarters . 
China reported on Tuesday the smallest number of new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week , but the World Health Organization said the data should still be viewed with caution .
