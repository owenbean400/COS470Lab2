A British man who was diagnosed with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan will be discharged from hospital tomorrow . 
Alan Steele , who announced the news on Facebook , said he will wait in the country until he can be reunited with his wife , Wendy , and they can travel home together . 
The couple , who were celebrating their honeymoon on the ship , were separated on 7 February when Alan was diagnosed with the virus and taken to a nearby hospital . 
Although the ship ’s quarantine officially ends on Wednesday , new guidelines mean anyone who shared a cabin with a person who has tested negative for the virus will face another two weeks on board . 
Alan has now tested negative for the virus , and says he is looking forward to eating at the Mc Donald ’s near the cruise terminal .
