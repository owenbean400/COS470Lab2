Repatriating passengers from the coronavirus stricken cruise ship in Japan is not without risks , a medical expert has said . 
Paul Hunter , professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia , said : Considerable care needs to be made to ensure that the passengers do not transmit infection between themselves or to cabin crew during the flight home and once back on home soil they do not act as a focus for the spread of the disease into their home countries â€“ any returning passengers may be put in quarantine on their return . 
He noted that while the quarantine seems to have been effective at stopping the spread of infection around the world as passengers return home or continue their travels , it has not stopped the coronavirus passing between passengers and crew . 
It is well known that certain infections such as influenza and norovirus can spread rapidly on board cruise ships . 
Cruise ships take passengers and crew from all over the world , often passengers are relatively elderly , they spend most of their time on board indoors mixing with others . 
The most likely [ infection ] route is direct person to person transmission when people are close to an infected person , but with currently publicly available information it is not possible to rule out other issues at this stage . 
Many countries , including the US , Canada and Australia have either evacuated their citizens or are in the process of doing so . 
The UK government has said it is in the process of organising a flight to bring back British nationals as soon as possible .
