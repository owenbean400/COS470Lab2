The World Health Organization is working " very closely " with the Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan . 
Dr Sylvie Briand , director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO , said : We need to make sure that we focus on our objective , our public health objective , which is to contain the virus , and not to contain the people . 
And making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries , but also the health of the people currently on this boat . 
She said there was so much still unknown about the virus that measures were monitored on a nearly hourly basis as authorities learned more about the disease .
