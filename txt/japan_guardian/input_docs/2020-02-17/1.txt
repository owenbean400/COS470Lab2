Japan is on the brink of recession , after its economy shrank at its fastest pace in more than five years as the impact of the coronavirus epidemic continues to set in . 
Official figures showed gross domestic product ( GDP ) declined by 1.6 % in the last quarter . 
If GDP falls for a second successive quarter , the economy will be in recession . 
Along with the coronavirus , a sales tax hitting consumer and business spending , and the impact of a major typhoon have also hit the world ’s third largest economy badly . 
Taro Saito , executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute , said : " There ’s a pretty good chance the economy will suffer another contraction in January March . 
" The virus will mainly hit inbound tourism and exports , but could also weigh on domestic consumption quite a lot . 
" If this epidemic is not contained by the time of the Tokyo Olympic Games , the damage to the economy will be huge . "
