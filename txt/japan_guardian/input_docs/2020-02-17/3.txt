The Department of Health has confirmed that a Holiday Inn at Heathrow Airport has been block booked to be used as a coronavirus facility . 
The hotel will be used by those who are considered at risk but have nowhere else to go . 
It can be used as a place for people to self isolate if they have been advised to do so , and to be tested for the virus and await results . 
All tests will be carried out by clinicians and anyone who does test positive will be transferred straight to hospital . 
Heathrow is the UK â€™s largest airline hub both in terms of incoming passengers but also those in transit .
