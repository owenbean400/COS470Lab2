The son of a British couple stuck onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship has renewed appeals for the UK government to help his parents . 
Steve Abel appeared in a video posted on his father ’s You Tube channel and admitted that his " greatest fear " was that his parents would become separated in Japan . 
Throughout the video he displayed a white piece of paper reading " Mum and Dad are fine ! " but said that his parents were beginning to feel the effects of living in quarantine for an extended period of time . 
He said : Please bear in mind they ’ve been on that cruise ship for 28 days . 
They ’re getting pretty fed up and they are the way they are because of the stress , the confinement within the cabin . 
Steve also asked the authorities to give his parents more information . 
This is my plea – I want my mum and dad to wake up in the morning and actually have some information sent to them ; they need to be communicated with . 
We ’re seeing things on the news and we ’re seeing things are happening but they ’re getting nothing , no one is actually speaking to them , which is driving them crazy . 
They must be going crazy as it is just being inside that cabin . 
Abel said he was extremely concerned that his parents may be separated abroad . 
Becoming visibly emotional , he said : My greatest fear is if they ’re separated . 
If they ’re not both on a flight home . 
But we ’re not going to think like that because they ’re coming home .
