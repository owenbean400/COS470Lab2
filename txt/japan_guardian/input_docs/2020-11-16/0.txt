Japan is under growing pressure to reimpose a state of emergency after a record of 1,722 infections were registered on Saturday . 
Cases are particularly high in the northern island of Hokkaido and the western prefectures of Hyogo and Osaka . 
Hokkaido ’s local government has said it will ask residents of Sapporo to stay at home after 189 new cases were reported in the prefecture on Monday , according to the Japan Times . 
In Tokyo , cases have neared 400 in recent days , levels not seen since early August . 
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga , however , has said the rising cases did not necessitate the reimposition of a state of emergency , or a halt to the government ’s campaign to encourage domestic tourism . 
The country ’s cumulative total stands at over 119,300 cases , including some 700 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Yokohama in February . 
The nationwide death toll is more than 1,900 .
