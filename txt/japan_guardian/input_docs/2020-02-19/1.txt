Britons returning home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that has had more than 600 cases of coronavirus will be quarantined at the same NHS facility that housed people flown back to the UK from Wuhan . 
The Department of Health said : " We can confirm that an accommodation block on the Arrowe Park NHS site will be used to isolate those returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan . 
They will be kept in this location for the 14 day quarantine period , with around the clock support from medical staff at all times . " 
Officials stressed there was no risk to the public and that the hospital in Wirral would continue to run as normal . 
This comes after the Foreign Office told British passengers onboard the ship to stay put or risk not being allowed on an evacuation flight later this week . 
An FCO statement read : " We are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess . 
We hope the flight will be later this week , subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities . 
" However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight . 
We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight . "
