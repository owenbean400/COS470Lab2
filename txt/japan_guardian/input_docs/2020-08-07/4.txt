As Covid 19 cases spike and hospital bed space dwindles in Alaska ’s largest city , Anchorage officials on Friday won a ruling in favour of a ban on indoor restaurant dining after a standoff over the issue moved to court . 
City officials this week sued to halt indoor dining service at one eatery that defied an emergency order issued on July 31 prohibiting the practice after coronavirus infections jumped sharply . 
On Friday , following two days of court hearings , state Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth sided with city officials and issued a temporary restraining order against the restaurant . 
" The restrictions on indoor restaurant dining are undeniably difficult for affected businesses , but they are medically necessary for the health of our entire community , " the municipality had said in its motion . 
Kriner ’s Diner defiance won them hundreds of supporters . 
Customers packed the restaurant for days , rallied outside the eatery and distributed " We Support Kriner ’s Diner " bumper stickers . 
A handful of other restaurants followed Kriner ’s example , and the city has sued a second diner .
