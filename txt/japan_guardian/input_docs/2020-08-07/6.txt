The UK government has been criticised by Conservative party members for their " unfair " lack of clarity over the possible implementation of further quarantine restrictions . 
Chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs Sir Graham Brady and former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith have called for a " proper testing regime for air travellers " to be implemented as quickly as possible , and for regional air corridors to be considered . 
It comes as Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned holidaymakers of the risk of travelling abroad during the coronavirus crisis amid concerns France may be the next nation to be added to the quarantine list . 
He said on Friday that ministers will " not hesitate " in ordering travellers coming back from countries with high Covid 19 rates to isolate for 14 days , as Belgium , Andorra and The Bahamas lose their exempted status . 
Travellers returning to the UK from those three nations from Saturday must enter quarantine , and there are fears those coming back from France could be next with cases there increasing . 
Sir Graham told The Telegraph leaving the public in the dark on the matter is " grossly unfair " . 
" We should move to a proper testing regime for air travellers as quickly as possible , but in the meantime it is essential that the government is as transparent as possible about the criteria which are being used judging which countries require quarantine and which do not . 
" Leaving the travelling public in the dark is grossly unfair and is causing further damage to the holiday and leisure sector . "
