US health officials reported this week that 15 adults were poisoned in Arizona and New Mexico in May and June after drinking hand sanitiser with four deaths . 
Three people had ongoing vision problems , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . 
All had consumed sanitizers containing methanol , or wood alcohol . 
The active ingredient that kills germs in legitimate sanitisers is ethyl alcohol , which is consumable . 
But some companies have been replacing it with poisonous methanol , which is used in antifreeze . 
The U.S . Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in June about Mexican made hand gel that it said contained large amounts of methanol . 
Since then , the FDA has expanded the list and identified dozens of hand sanitisers that contain methanol and have been recalled in the US by manufacturers and distributors .
