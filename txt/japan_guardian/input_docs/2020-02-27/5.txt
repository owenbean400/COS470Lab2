A man from Derbyshire who travelled to the H10 hotel in Tenerife for four nights has confirmed that British guests are desperate to return to the UK to avoid contracting the disease . 
" None of the Brits staying here feel safe " , he told PA . 
The 60 year old said : " We have been told to stay in our rooms but the hotel has no way of enforcing it . 
We have a Whats App group for all of the Brits and we do not feel safe . 
We think this is going to end up worse than that ship [ the Diamond Princess ] . 
" I do not think confusion would be the right word to describe it – they are just not able to enforce quarantine conditions . 
People are able to walk around the buildings and some are even going in the pool . 
People are walking about and interacting with each other and not wearing masks . 
They served a buffet style dinner last night , and people were milling about without masks , touching utensils – the virus is bound to spread . 
" It ’s totally crazy . 
We feel we are just being quarantined until we eventually get it [ Covid 19 ] . 
No one seems to be helping , and the consulate are not helping us – why ca not they bring us home ? 
We are in a quarantine that is not being followed and it is not safe . 
" I ran out of medication and visited the front desk as I was told more would be brought in . 
But they were unable to find my medication . 
Eventually , I was given some but I ’ve been told now they wo not give out more than one day ’s worth at a time , so I have already run out again and will need to go back . 
They could not give me any information about why this was . "
