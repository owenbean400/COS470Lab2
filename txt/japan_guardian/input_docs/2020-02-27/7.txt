The New York Times has some alarming detail about the first person to person transmission of Covid 19 within the United States ( see earlier ) . 
A California coronavirus patient had to wait days to be tested because of restrictive federal criteria , despite doctors ’ suggestions . 
Doctors at the University of California , Davis , Medical Center considered the novel pathogen a possible diagnosis when the person was first admitted last week . 
But the federal agency that conducts the testing did not administer the test until days later because the case did not fit the agency ’s narrow testing criteria , university officials said in a letter to the campus community .
