Italian churches are stepping up measures to contain the spread of coronavirus , calling on priests not to distribute holy communion wafers directly on to worshippers â€™ tongues and urging congregations to avoid exchanging handshakes during mass . 
The Catholic archdiocese of Messina in Sicily made the recommendations in response to the rapid rise in infections in Italy . 
In an official statement , the religious authorities of the Sicilian province wrote : " In the face of the spread of the coronavirus , it is considered appropriate to comply with some provisions and hygiene measures . 
As a precaution we are advising to distribute the Eucharist preferably into the hands of the faithful , and to avoid the physical contact from a peaceful handshake . "
