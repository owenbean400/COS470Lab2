Insurers and travel companies should not be asking people for GP letters to get holiday refunds for trips they cannot go on due to the coronavirus . 
The Royal College of GPs said it had heard reports of businesses asking for GP letters in order for people to cancel holidays due to Covid 19.Prof Martin Marshall , the chair of the Royal College of GPs , said : Insurers and travel companies should be basing their decisions to offer refunds on advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Public Health England , not letters from GPs . 
It is not a good use of GPs ’ time to be writing letters for patients who are not ill but have plans to travel – and GPs will always base their decisions on official advice . 
Patients will undoubtedly have good and sensible reasons for not wanting to travel to certain places because of Covid 19 , but this is not the same as being unable to travel due to existing illness , and it should not become the GP ’s responsibility to give patients advice about where not to travel .
