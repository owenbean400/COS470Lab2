The UK residents who were trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan for more than two weeks are en route to a further 14 days of isolation at a facility on Merseyside , after landing back in the south of England ( see 11.47am ) . 
Thirty two masked British and European evacuees from the vessel are being bussed with a police escort to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral , where they will spend a fortnight in quarantine to protect against the spread of the illness should any of them be infected . 
The group , who tested negative for Covid 19 before they flew , are expected to arrive at the hospital later on Saturday afternoon . 
As with the previous coach loads of people brought to Arrowe Park , the bus drivers did not appear to be wearing any protective clothing as the convoy , escorted by police and ambulance vehicles , was pictured leaving the Mo D base . 
Before the flight , one passenger who was diagnosed with Covid 19 at a Japanese hospital but was since given the all clear said he expected the experience would be like visiting a holiday camp . 
Alan Steele , who was on honeymoon with his wife , Wendy , wrote on Facebook : " Wendy ’s test was negative so ‘ Butlins the Wirral ’ here we come for 14 days . " 
Since being kept onboard the cruise liner in the port of Yokohama , 634 passengers and crew have been infected – accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China . 
It is understood some British nationals who are part of the Diamond Princess crew opted to remain .
