Around 100 more passengers were allowed to disembark from the coronavirus stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship on Saturday , as Japan ’s health minister apologised after 23 others were allowed to leave without being properly tested , AFP reports . 
The 100 passengers included the last group of Japanese passengers to leave the ship , while some foreign passengers were still waiting onboard for chartered aircraft to be sent by their governments . 
About 970 passengers disembarked earlier this week . 
Television footage showed a driver in a white protective suit at the wheel of a bus with the curtains drawn so that passengers could not be identified . 
They will be quarantined for two weeks near Tokyo , officials said . 
At a news conference , the health minister , Katsunobu Katō , apologised that 23 passengers had been allowed to disembark without undergoing all the required tests . 
" We deeply regret that our operational mistake caused the situation , " Katō said , adding that the passengers would be tested again . 
With the latest disembarkation , a 14 day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still onboard as many of them did not undergo isolation because they were needed to keep the ship running . 
They were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins , leading some critics to say they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship , which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly Covid 19 disease . 
Katō defended Japan ’s onboard quarantine , telling a TV programme on Saturday that there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3,000 people at once .
