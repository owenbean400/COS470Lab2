Singapore confirmed 1,111 new cases of the novel coronavirus today , the vast majority of whom are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories . 
Only 20 cases were Singaporean citizens or permanent residents , according to the health ministry . 
Less than a month ago , the city state was being hailed as one of the countries that had got its coronavirus response right . 
But then the second wave hit , hard . 
Since March 17 , Singapore 's number of confirmed coronavirus cases grew from 266 to at least 9,125 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
What went wrong ? 
The answer appears to lie in clusters of cases among migrant workers living in cramped dormitories , and an underestimation of the speed at which those infections could spread through a city where lockdown measures had not been put in place . 
Many of these workers are from South Asia , and appear to have been overlooked in the initial wave of testing . 
Now , multiple dormitories have been quarantined and the government is ramping up testing for all workers . 
This post was updated to include the latest number of total cases .
