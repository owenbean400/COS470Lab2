Chile will begin issuing digital immunity cards this week to people who have recovered from coronavirus , according to an announcement from health officials on Monday . 
The so called " Covid cards " will be issued to people who tested positive for the virus and have shown signs of recovery after a 14 day quarantine . 
The program , which had been announced by the Chilean health minister last week , was scheduled to launch Monday but has now been postponed for the next " coming days , " according to the country â€™s public health undersecretary Paula Daza . 
Chilean health officials said last week the Covid card would help identify those individuals who no longer pose a health risk to others . 
As of Monday , Chile had reported 10,507 confirmed cases of coronavirus , and 139 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
