The percentage of people that tested positive for Covid 19 in New York City increased to 4.76 % on Wednesday , Mayor Bill de Blasio said . 
That is up from 4.14 % reported Tuesday . 
De Blasio warned that the city 's Covid 19 indicators could be changing as the second wave is bearing down . 
At least 146 people have been admitted into the hospital for suspected cases of Covid 19 and the confirmed positivity rate is 48.34 % , the mayor said . 
The threshold for hospitalizations is 200 which would trigger more restrictions , according to de Blasio . 
This comes after the city says they will pay close attention to hospitalizations as hospitals in the NYC Health & Hospital systems are about two thirds full , Dr . Mitchell Katz said Tuesday . 
Katz added that none of the 11 hospitals within the NYC health & Hospital system are overwhelmed as of Tuesday , but " if there is a major increase of cases we are prepared to handle that , " he said . 
The city 's 7 day average of new cases stands at about 1,809 – that is above the 550 case threshold , de Blasio said .
