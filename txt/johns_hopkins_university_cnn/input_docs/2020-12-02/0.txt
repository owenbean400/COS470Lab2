Nursing homes in the United States recently reported their highest weekly new coronavirus cases since the spring , the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living ( AHCA/NCAL ) said in a report published Tuesday . 
The rise correlates with a surge in infections nationwide . 
Nursing homes in the Midwest were particularly hard hit , with a more then 400 % increase in weekly cases since mid September . 
During the week of Nov . 15 , 49 % of new nursing home cases were in the Midwest . 
Between mid September and the week of Nov . 15 , there was a 177 % rise in new weekly nursing home cases nationwide . 
The rise in cases has been accompanied by a rise in coronavirus deaths in nursing homes . 
The report cites data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . 
Health experts say that rising community spread of the virus is a good indicator for surges in nursing homes .
