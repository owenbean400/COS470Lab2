For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit Cuba , Havana residents will face a nightly curfew and will not be allowed to travel to other provinces , the city 's mayor said . 
Cuban authorities have struggled to control a second wave of coronavirus outbreak in Havana , just weeks after they had said the spread of the virus was all but defeated on the island . 
The curfew , from 7 p.m . to 5 a.m . , starts Tuesday evening local time . 
It will last for at least 15 days , said Gov . 
Reinaldo Garcia Zapata . 
He added that the new restrictions will also increase penalties on people not wearing a mask , and ban the consumption of alcohol in public . 
Cuba has recorded a total of 3,806 coronavirus cases and 92 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
