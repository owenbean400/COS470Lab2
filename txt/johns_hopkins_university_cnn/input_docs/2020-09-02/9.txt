Coronavirus deaths are just that – deaths caused by Covid 19 , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday . 
President Trump has retweeted social media conspiracy theories saying that only a small percentage of the people reported to have died from coronavirus really did die from the virus . 
They have pointed to death certificates that list other underlying causes . 
But that does not mean the patients did not die from coronavirus , Bob Anderson , chief of mortality statistics at CDC , said in a statement . 
" The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person ’s death . 
In 92 % of all deaths that mention Covid 19 , Covid 19 is listed as the underlying cause of death , " the statement added . 
Some context : Other top health officials , including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr . Anthony Fauci , have said that CDC mortality statistics are accurate , and have explained that just because a death certificate lists other conditions , it does not mean one of those conditions caused a death . 
What the other conditions do tell doctors , Anderson said , is that people who have chronic conditions are more likely to suffer severe disease and to die from coronavirus . 
Death certificates may also include acute conditions caused by the viral infection , such as pneumonia or respiratory failure . 
By the numbers : According to Johns Hopkins University , which uses independent data for its reporting on coronavirus cases and deaths , there have been more than 6 million coronavirus cases in the US and more than 184,000 people have died from it as of late Wednesday afternoon . 
CDC data shows that as of Aug . 22 , 161,392 death certificates listed coronavirus as a cause of death . 
CDC data often lags behind Johns Hopkins data .
