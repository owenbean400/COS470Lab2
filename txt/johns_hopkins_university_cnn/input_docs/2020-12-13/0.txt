According to Johns Hopkins University 's tally , the United States has recorded 16,062,299 cases of coronavirus and at least 297,818 people there have died from the virus . 
On Saturday , Johns Hopkins University recorded 219,510 new cases and 2,368 new deaths across all 50 states , the District of Columbia and other US territories , as well as repatriated cases . 
Saturday was the seventh day in a row that hospitalizations hit a record high , with 108,487 patients in hospitals around the country , according to the Covid Tracking Project . 
The US added an additional 1 million cases in the past four days . 
It took the nation more than eight months to reach 8 million cases but less than two months to double that , as the number of new cases continues to soar . 
That dire new toll comes as a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee voted Saturday to recommend the Pfizer and Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine for patients 16 and older . 
Doses will begin to be rolled out in the coming days .
