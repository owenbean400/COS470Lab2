Wisconsin teachers unions are requesting that virtual learning be implemented from kindergarten through college across the state due to the increase of new Covid 19 cases , according to a release from Milwaukee ’s teachers union . 
The Milwaukee Teachers ' Education Association called on the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to begin virtual instruction until the community spread is contained , according to a statement posted on its Facebook page on Thursday . 
" DHS should confirm that plans are feasible , and the district , school , college or university does in fact have the necessary PPE and resources to accomplish the reopening plan , " the statement said . 
Teachers believe authorities have not done enough to keep in person learning safe . 
" Families are knowingly sending COVID 19 positive sick symptomatic students to school , " said Amy Mizialko , a representative of the Milwaukee Teachers ' Education Association . 
Traci De Salvo , with Wisconsin Department of Health Services , told CNN affiliate WKOW they are providing information for schools to make safe decisions . 
On Thursday , the state 's health department said that 45 of Wisconsin ’s 72 counties " meet the threshold of very high activity " for Covid 19 infections , with 41 counties showing cases on the rise as reported in an earlier alert .
