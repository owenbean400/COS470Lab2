The US is adding an average of more than 74,000 new Covid 19 cases to the national total every day -- a record high in a pandemic that experts say is likely to worsen . 
The seven day average is part of a fall surge that has brought the national case count to more than 8.8 million , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Four of the five highest number of cases in a single day were recorded in the past seven days , with the top two reported on Friday and Saturday . 
And 41 states are reporting at least 10 % more cases compared to the week before . 
When it comes to the climbing metric , the US is " not in a good place , " director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr . Anthony Fauci said during a virtual Q&A on Wednesday .

Rising hospitalizations : In the Midwest , residents are being impacted by the rising cases with spiking rates of hospitalizations .
