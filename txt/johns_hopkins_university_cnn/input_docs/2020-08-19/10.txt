Almost 2,000 K 12 students in Mississippi have been quarantined in the state due to possible exposure to Covid 19 . 
Dr . Thomas Dobbs , with the Mississippi Department of Health , said that 1,970 students and 328 school staff are quarantined in the state . 
Dobbs said the state is also watching two outbreaks at two universities in the state – University of Mississippi and Mississippi University for Women . 
CNN has reached out to both universities for more information on their Covid 19 outbreaks . 
The state has reported 1,348 new Covid 19 cases and 31 new deaths today . 
Mississippi Gov . 
Tate Reeves said that today ’s numbers are bad and do not follow the downward trend the state has been seeing recently . 
Dobbs said a major concern in the state is that the people who are dying have not been exposed to the virus in congregate settings , but are instances of community spread of the disease . 
To note : These numbers were released by the state of Mississippi and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
