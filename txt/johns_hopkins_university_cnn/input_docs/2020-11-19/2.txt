The US just surpassed a tragic milestone of more than 250,000 coronavirus deaths and more than 11.5 million infections nationwide , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .

" Each person has a different amount of virus that they need , " explains Erin Bromage , an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts , Dartmouth . 
Put it all together , and the chance of infection depends on the physiology of the potential host , as well as their personal behaviors and health habits such as smoking status , diet , physical activity and sleep . 
An elderly or unhealthy host in the face of large , recurrent exposures is clearly the worst case scenario . 
But a medically fragile person could be sickened by even a low dose of virus ; conversely , a healthy person can be overwhelmed with a high enough dose .
