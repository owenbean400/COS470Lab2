A statewide mask mandate will be in place in New Hampshire starting Friday , Gov . 
Chris Sununu announced Thursday . 
All residents above the age of five will be required to wear a face covering when unable to keep at least six feet of distance in both indoor or outdoor public spaces , according to a release from the governor ’s office . 
The decision comes as the state has experienced a 100 % increase in its hospitalization rate over the past two weeks , the governor said . 
More than 70 % of New Hampshire ’s hospitals and long term care facilities are experiencing some sort of " staffing crunch , " Sununu said . 
Dr . Benjamin Chan , an epidemiologist for the state 's Department Health and Human Services , announced 529 new Covid 19 cases and two additional coronavirus related deaths . 
That brings the statewide total to 15,749 cases and 504 deaths , according New Hampshire ’s Covid 19 dashboard .
