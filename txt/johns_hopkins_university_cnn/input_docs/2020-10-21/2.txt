" Halloween is happening in New York City , and Halloween will be safe in New York City , " Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday . 
He laid out some safety guidelines for the holiday : Trick or treating should be done all outdoors , not inside apartment buildings . 
Treats should be placed in a bin rather than handed out . 
People should step back six feet after ringing door bells and use sanitizer . 
The mayor also stressed a mask in a costume " is not the same as the kind of mask we use to protect ourselves and each other . " 
Here are the latest numbers on coronavirus in New York City : 1.56 % of people tested positive citywide , keeping the number under the 5 % threshold , de Blasio said . 
The seven day rolling average is 1.68 % . 
In addition , 77 people were hospitalized . 
New York City is also reporting a seven day average of 493 new reported cases , with a threshold of 550 cases . 
Five schools are on a 14 day shut down , though one is coming out of the shutdown Thursday . 
One note : These numbers were released by the city 's public health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
