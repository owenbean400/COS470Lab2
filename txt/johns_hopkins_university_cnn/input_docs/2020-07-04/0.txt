US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial on Friday to celebrate an early Fourth of July at a gathering of about 7,500 people during the global coronavirus pandemic . 
No social distancing was planned for the event -- despite record high new coronavirus cases in the country . 
And the event is taking place amid environmental concerns over the use of fireworks in the dry land and as the US engages in a reckoning over its own monuments and racist history . 
" We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home , but those who want to come and join us , we 'll be giving out free face masks if they choose to wear one . 
But we wo not be social distancing , " Republican Gov . 
Kristi Noem said during a Monday appearance on Fox News . 
There may be health screening for ticketed guests in one area , according to recreation.gov . 
A recording on the park 's main telephone line Monday said : " There are no social distancing requirements in place at this time . " 
The 7,500 tickets for Friday 's event are lower than the typical visitor flow during the busy summer season . 
On normal days , up to 32,000 visitors come to Mount Rushmore during a 10 hour period . 
The park never closed during the pandemic , but visitation has been down to about 20,000 people , said Maureen Mc Gee Ballinger , Mount Rushmore 's chief of interpretation and education . 
Coronavirus cases in South Dakota remain stable , according to data from Johns Hopkins University , with 6,893 confirmed cases and 97 deaths as of Thursday . 
But it remains to be seen how many attendees will travel from other states , 36 of which are experiencing a rise in new cases .
