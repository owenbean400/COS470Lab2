Almost half the US is reporting increased numbers of new Covid 19 cases as health experts warn of a potential coronavirus surge in the fall and winter . 
As of Sunday , the number of new coronavirus cases has increased by at least 10 % or more compared to the week before in 21 states , most of them in the West , according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Cases are rising in Alabama , Alaska , Colorado , Idaho , Maine , Michigan , Minnesota , Montana , Nevada , New Jersey , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Texas , Utah , Washington state , Wisconsin and Wyoming . 
Eighteen states were holding steady . 
Only 11 -- Arizona , Louisiana , Tennessee , Georgia , Florida , Virginia , Maryland , Connecticut , Rhode Island , Vermont and New Hampshire -- saw decreases of new cases of more than 10 % compared to the week prior . 
The US could see an explosion of Covid 19 cases in the fall and winter as people exercise less caution and spend more time indoors , where there is a greater likelihood of transmission , according to Dr . Chris Murray , director of the University of Washington 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) . 
Murray says the IHME model shows a " huge surge " expected to take off in October " and accelerate in November and December . " 
The IHME model indicates that the country is currently seeing about 765 daily deaths from Covid 19 , but that number could jump to 3,000 daily deaths by late December .
