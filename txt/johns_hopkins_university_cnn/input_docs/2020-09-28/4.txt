As cases spike in parts of New York City , Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo warned that Covid 19 " remains a force to be reckoned with throughout the country . " 
Experts have cautioned the US could see an explosion of coronavirus cases in the fall and winter as people exercise less caution and spend more time indoors . 
Already the US has reported more than 7.1 million cases and 204,756 deaths since the pandemic began , and 21 states are reporting more new cases in the last seven days compared with the week before , according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Once the epicenter of the pandemic in the US , New York had boasted a test positivity rate — the percentage of tests being performed that come back positive for the virus — of less than 1 % for more than a month . 
That rate broke 1 % on Saturday as Cuomo reminded New Yorkers " we cannot drop our guard . " 
Though the rate of positive tests is still low relative to other states , neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn are seeing cases " continue to grow at an alarming rate , " according to a news release from the city 's Department of Health . 
But New York is still among the states with the lowest positivity rate in the US . 
The World Health Organization advised that the rates of positivity in testing should remain at 5 % or lower for at least 14 days before businesses reopen . 
Currently , 22 states and the District of Columbia meet that recommendation , with Vermont holding the lowest rate at 0.53 % positive . 
Twenty eight states and Puerto Rico have positivity rates higher than 5 % . 
The territory has a 100 % positivity rate . 
Among US states , the rate is highest , 24.64 % , in South Dakota , according to Johns Hopkins University .
