Rio de Janeiro ’s world famous carnival parade has been postponed for 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The head of the League of Samba Schools , the group that organizes the two day parade , announced the decision during a Rio de Janeiro news conference Thursday . 
Castanheira said no new date had been set for the parade , which was scheduled to take place in late February . 
The pre lent holiday usually attracts millions of Brazilian and foreign tourists to Rio de Janeiro . 
In 2020 , more than 2 million people descended upon the city , bringing more than 700 million dollars in revenue , according to state tourism agency Riotur . 
Riotur acting president Fabricio Villa Flor told CNN Brasil Friday that he ’s going to set up a meeting with the samba parade organizers to determine a new date . 
" We are going to discuss the possibility of a new design ( for the parade ) , but it ’s difficult given the large gathering of people that occurs during carnival , " Villa Flor said . 
Brazil has the world ’s third worst coronavirus outbreak after the US and India , with more than 4.6 million cases , according to the latest Johns Hopkins University data .
