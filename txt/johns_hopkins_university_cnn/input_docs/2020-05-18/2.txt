El Salvador 's President Nayib Bukele addressed the nation Sunday night regarding his decision to extend the country 's coronavirus related state of emergency through executive order . 
The decision was met by fierce backlash from the Legislative Assembly , which was not consulted prior to the announcement . 
In order to calm the conflict between the President and the legislative and judicial powers , Bukele used the address to call for dialogue on all sides . 
Lawmakers , from both left leaning and right leaning parties , have come out in opposition to Bukele and have scheduled an extraordinary plenary session later today to vote on a new emergency law , which will include plans to gradually reactivate the economy . 
El Salvador 's Attorney General 's Office also formally opened an " unconstitutionality decree " with the Supreme Court , saying Bukele evaded the powers of the Legislative Assembly . 
The country has officially recorded more than 1,300 coronavirus cases , including at least 30 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
