Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , said he 's optimistic that the US will have a vaccine by the end of this year or the beginning of 2021 . 
" I 'm one of those who 's optimistic we will have one or more vaccines that turn out to be safe and effective by sometime around the end of this year , maybe a little bit into January , " he said . 
The politicization of the vaccine development process has been a distraction , one that has polarized many people , Collins noted during a Johns Hopkins University and University of Washington virtual symposium on vaccine development . 
" Putting all that aside and dealing with the fact that we have this huge problem of vaccine hesitancy that needs to be dealt with , I am still guardedly optimistic that come 2021 , we 're going to be on a path – over many months , let 's not talk about this being a quick solution , but on a path – where we can eventually put Covid 19 in the rear view mirror , although we will be changed by it , and I think he will be around us globally for quite a long time to come , " said Collins .
