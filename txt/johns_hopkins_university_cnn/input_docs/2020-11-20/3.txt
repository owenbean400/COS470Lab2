There are " encouraging signs " the number of coronavirus cases in the United Kingdom are starting to flatten , the country â€™s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said . 
But he warned it wo not be a normal Christmas . 
The four nations of the UK have all tightened restrictions in recent weeks as a second wave of infections took hold . 
Asked about plans to ease restrictions for Christmas , Hancock said the government was hoping to come up with a uniform set of rules across the UK . 
" It of course wo not be like a normal Christmas , there will have to be rules in place . 
But we hope that they 'll allow for a bit more of that normal Christmas that people really look forward to , " he said . 
The UK has recorded more than 1.4 million virus cases and 53,870 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
