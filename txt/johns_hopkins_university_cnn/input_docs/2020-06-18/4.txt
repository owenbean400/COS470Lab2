At least eight health workers have been " arbitrarily detained " in Egypt since March for " expressing their health related concerns " on social media , according to the rights advocacy group . 
Medical workers face charges such as " spreading false news " and " terrorism , " Amnesty International added . 
The Egyptian Doctors ’ Syndicate said Wednesday that at least 73 medical workers had died in the country due to coronavirus .
