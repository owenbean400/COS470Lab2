Portugal 's government has asked the country 's president to declare a state of emergency because of a spike in cases in the country . 
Costa said the state of emergency would " eliminate judicial doubt " about some of the government 's decisions to restrict the right of movement and the right to gather , which are essential rights under the Portuguese constitution . 
The move would also allow the government to order private hospitals and centers to assist with the care of Covid 19 patients . 
Portugal 's president will meet the leaders of other political parties before making a decision . 
Costa 's statement came after he announced strict new measures to contain the rising number of cases in Portugal on Saturday . 
Portugal has recorded more than 144,000 Covid 19 cases over the course of the pandemic , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Meanwhile cases are surging across Europe , leaving authorities scrambling to contain the second wave . 
In Switzerland , officials have recorded more than 20,000 new infections in the past 72 hours . 
There were 21,926 new Covid 19 cases reported on Monday , according to Switzerland â€™s Federal Office of Public Health . 
The country has recorded 176,177 cases in total . 
Swiss health authorities also reported 93 deaths over the weekend , taking the country 's coronavirus death toll to 2,130 . 
In Germany , the number of coronavirus patients in ICUs has tripled in the last two weeks , according to health minister Jens Spahn . 
And in the UK , Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to make a statement to MPs on Monday , warning that virus deaths in the winter could be twice as high as during the first wave of the outbreak , according to the PA media news agency . 
PA reports that Johnson will say there is no alternative but to impose a new lockdown in England .
