Production of Corona beer has been temporarily suspended in Mexico because of the coronavirus pandemic , said Grupo Modelo , the company that makes the popular beverage . 
In a statement on Twitter , the company said it was halting the production and marketing of its beer because the Mexican government has shuttered non essential businesses . 
The Anheuser Busch Inbev owned company also makes Modelo and Pacifico beers . 
This week , the Mexican government announced the suspension of non essential activities in the public and private sectors until April 30 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus . 
The country has more than 1,500 cases and 50 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Grupo Modelo is ready to enact a plan to " guarantee the supply of beer " if the Mexican government decides to include breweries as essential , according to a statement .
