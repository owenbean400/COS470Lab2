Sen . 
Bill Cassidy , a Republican from Louisiana , wants to create a registry to track who has recovered from the coronavirus . 
He said a registry would be set up similar to the one that is used to document vaccinations . 
Once a patient has recovered , their name would be added to the registry . 
They could then return to work and help treat people with coronavirus without worrying about getting sick . 
He said this information would also help protect the rest of the population who do not have the virus . 
" If we say 95 % of people are immune , even if a person is spewing virus it would mean the 95 % of people are immune , " he said . 
Cassidy said there is some uncertainty around whether the presence of antibodies actually means a person wo not get the virus again . 
" I can see there 's uncertainty here , but if we wait for absolute certainty our economy 's going to be in the tank , " he said . 
" So there 's going to be a tradeoff on the absolute certainty on the medical aspect and opening up education and society for society to continue to flourish . " 
So far , 9,920 people have recovered from coronavirus in the US , according to Johns Hopkins University .
