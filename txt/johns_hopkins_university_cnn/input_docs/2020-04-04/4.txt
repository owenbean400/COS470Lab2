A good Samaritan decided to use the $ 900 he 'd been saving to do something nice for nurses on the front lines in Detroit , Michigan . 
Allen Marshall spent Wednesday and Thursday at an Exxon station near the Detroit Medical Center with a sign that said : " FREE GAS FOR NURSES . " 
Michigan is one of the hardest hit US states in the coronavirus pandemic , according to Johns Hopkins University , with 10,791 cases and 417 deaths . 
Imran Al Samet works at the Exxon station and told CNN that Marshall had bought gas for between 50 and 80 people . 
Marshall told The Detroit Free Press that he 'd been saving the money to buy a knife sharpening tool . 
His wife is an essential worker at Blue Cross Blue Shield , the paper reported , so he did the giveaway after he dropped her off at work . 
" Oh my goodness , that is so nice of him , " one nurse , who was not identified , told WDIV . 
" That 's so good . 
God bless him . "
