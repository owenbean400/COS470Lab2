New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said today during his daily press briefing the city has done aggressive outreach in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn , which saw an outbreak of more than 200 Covid 19 cases last week . 
The mayor said there has been a large outreach including door knocks , robocalls , actual phone calls and testing — 5,200 tests since July 29 . 
He did not provide updated case numbers . 
Individual households with specific problems are working with the city ’s test and trace team to separate within the households and prevent further spread within the community . 
The mayor said these particular households have 90 % compliance . 
However , de Blasio added , several hundred gathered in illegal spaces in the same neighborhood recently including two illegal raves which were broken up by the sheriff , according to the mayor who said people will be held accountable . 
Here are some of the latest coronavirus numbers from NYC : 57 people were admitted to hospitals for suspected cases of coronavirus , which is under the threshold of 200 . 264 people are in the public hospitals intensive care units , which is under the threshold of 375 . 
One percent have tested positive , which is well under the threshold at 15 % . 
One thing to note : These numbers were released by the city ’s public health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
