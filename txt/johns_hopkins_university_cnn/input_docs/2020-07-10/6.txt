Arkansas Gov . 
Asa Hutchinson said today that 751 new Covid 19 cases were reported in the state , with 149 of those from correctional facilities . 
The total number of Covid 19 cases in the state now stands at 26,803 . 
Hot Springs County has shown the highest return on positive cases over the past two days , Hutchinson said in a news conference Friday afternoon . 
A majority of the new cases being reported in the county are from the Ouachita River Correctional Unit , according to Dr . Nate Smith , director of Arkansas Department of Health . 
Many of the newer positive cases were from people who previously tested negative but later developed symptoms and were retested , Smith said . 
More data : The state has conducted more than 5,200 tests over the past 24 hours . 
The average time to get test results back from a commercial lab is 2.5 days , up from a low of 1.6 in April . 
" That 's something that concerns us because we need quick results that helps us to manage the outbreak , to control it , to isolate people that need to be isolated , " Hutchinson said . 
" We want to watch that and , hopefully , with national support , we can get more resources in our commercial labs so we can get a quicker response time . 
That will help us in states like Arkansas . " 
The governor said while he 's not concerned with having enough testing materials , he is concerned with the increased number of tests the labs outside of the state are doing , which results in delayed reporting . 
To note : These numbers were released by Arkansas Department of Health , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
