So many people in Sweden have been exposed to the coronavirus that the country will likely be in a better place to withstand a second wave of infections , said state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell . 
Sweden has taken a relatively relaxed approach to coronavirus related restrictions when compared with other European countries . 
Tegnell estimated an immunity level of between 15 % to 20 % had been reached in the Stockholm population , which he said would " slow down the spread ( of a second wave ) . " 
But he cautioned that it would not be enough to achieve herd immunity , and that there 's still a lot unknown about immunity to the disease . 
Sweden has reported 16,755 cases of the coronavirus , including 2,021 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Asked whether the death toll would have been lower if Sweden had implemented tighter restrictions , Tegnell replied , " that â€™s a very difficult question to answer at this stage . 
At least 50 % of our death toll is within the elderly homes and we have a hard time understanding how a lockdown would stop the introduction of the disease into the elderly homes . "
