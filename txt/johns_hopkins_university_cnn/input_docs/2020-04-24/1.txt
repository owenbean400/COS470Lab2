The country also recorded a fourth consecutive day of single digit new cases , suggesting a potential slowdown of the outbreak . 
The country has now reported 10,708 cases , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
According to the KCDC , fewer than 2,000 of those are active cases , with the majority of total infected patients having recovered . 
The country 's government has been among the most ambitious when it comes to providing the public with free and easy testing options . 
Experts have attributed South Korea 's decline in new cases to its early testing efforts , a successful example of what is now commonly referred to as " flattening the curve . "
