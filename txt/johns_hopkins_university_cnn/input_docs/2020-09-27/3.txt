The US could see an explosion of Covid 19 cases as fall and winter set in , one expert says , joining a chorus of health officials who have warned about the challenges of the coming months . 
Two things will likely help drive that expected winter surge , according to Dr . Chris Murray , director of the University of Washington 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) : " First , as case counts have come down in some states , we tend to see that people become less careful , they tend to have more contact , " he said . 
" But then the most important effect is the seasonality of the virus , that people go indoors , transmission happens more , " he added . 
The IHME model indicates that the country is currently seeing about 765 daily deaths from Covid 19 , but that number could jump to 3,000 daily deaths by late December . 
More than 204,000 Americans have already died from the virus since the start of the pandemic and more than 7 million have been infected , according to Johns Hopkins University .
