As Florida restaurants and bars enjoyed their first full day of operation without Covid 19 restrictions in months , the mayor of Miami warned that the governor 's decision to fully reopen such establishments and to limit local governments ' ability to enforce their own restrictions could have devastating consequences . 
" I think it 's going to have a huge impact , " Mayor Francis Suarez told CNN on Saturday about Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis ' decision to allow restaurants , bars and other businesses to open at full capacity and to suspend fines for all outstanding penalties issued to those who did not follow Covid 19 restrictions -- such as not wearing a mask in public . 
" You know , I just do not know how many people are actually going to do it now . " 
De Santis signed an executive order on Friday evening allowing restaurants and bars to immediately begin operating at 100 % capacity . 
He cited the economic hardships of not operating businesses at full capacity , according to the order . 
Suarez said mandating mask wearing in public and slowly reopening has helped to keep the coronavirus case count down in Miami . 
There have been nearly 700,000 cases of coronavirus in Florida and the virus has killed more than 14,000 people in the state , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Nationwide , more than 7 million people have been infected and 204,497 have died . 
Suarez said he 's concerned that the changes in the state are coming as flu season ramps up and schools prepare for in person learning to begin in mid October . 
" We 'll see in the next couple of weeks whether he 's right about his perspective . 
But if he 's wrong about his perspective ... it 's going to be very , very , very difficult for him and it 's going to be a very difficult time , because it 's in the middle of flu season , " Suarez said .
