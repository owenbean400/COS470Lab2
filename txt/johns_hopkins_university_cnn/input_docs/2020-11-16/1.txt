Washington state on Sunday announced new coronavirus restrictions , months after suffering the country 's first major outbreaks . 
What the restrictions mean : Indoor social gatherings with people from outside the home are prohibited , unless participants quarantine for 14 days prior , or quarantine for seven days before the gathering and receive a negative Covid 19 test result no more than 48 hours prior . 
Outdoor gatherings will be limited to five people . 
Restaurants and bars will be limited to outdoors with capacity limits and to go service , Inslee said . 
In store retail stores , including grocery stores , are limited to 25 % capacity . 
Religious services will also be limited to 25 % of indoor capacity or 200 people , whichever is less , Inslee said . 
Performances by choirs , bands and ensembles are also prohibited . 
The order allows for solo performances , but Inslee said it 's " too risky " for indoor choirs . 
Additionally , indoor service at gyms will be prohibited , along with bowling alleys , museums and movie theaters , among others businesses . 
The new restrictions will not impact childcare and K 12 schools , Inslee said . 
School districts that are currently holding in person learning do not need to close , unless local officials make that determination . 
Rising cases : The new restrictions are a reflection of the drastic rise in cases seen not only in Washington state but across the country . 
And they further underscore the threat of the ongoing fall surge many states are struggling to control . 
As of Sunday night , the state had more than 130,000 cases , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
More than 2,500 people have died .
