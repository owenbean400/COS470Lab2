Ukraine may move its plans to ease lockdown forward , citing positive trends in the rate of new coronavirus cases , its President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday . 
In a news conference marking his first year in office , Zelensky said the country might allow some measures to gradually lift lockdown -- including restrictions on public transportation -- to be introduced earlier than anticipated . 
" We understand that today there are good statistics , " he said , according to a transcript released by the presidential administration . 
" Thanks to our doctors , and this allows some stages to be â€¦ brought closer to the present . " 
Zelensky added that the government would discuss the possibility of resuming public and suburban transport from Friday , the readout stated . 
" We ca not provide transport between the regions yet , because we have only six oblasts [ regions ] ready for it , " he said . 
" We see normal statistics where the number of patients is decreasing only in six oblasts . " 
Ukraine has 19,230 recorded cases of coronavirus with 564 deaths , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University .
