Shocking photos show seven bodies in the open back of a pick up truck in Philadelphia , which were transported from a local hospital to the medical examiner ’s office Sunday . 
The Philadelphia Department of Health confirms the incident and the number of bodies in the truck . 
" The transportation of the bodies in that manner is a breach of protocol , " said James Garrow , spokesman for the Department of Public Health . 
More than 10,000 coronavirus cases , including at least 394 deaths , have been recorded in Philadelphia , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The cause of death of the bodies in the photos is unknown . 
The bodies were being transported from Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia to an overflow storage area , according to a spokesman from the hospital . 
The cause of death of the deceased is not known at this time . 
The photos , taken by the Philadelphia Inquirer , show bodies stacked in the flatbed of a pick up truck outside of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner 's Office overflow storage area . 
In one of the pictures , individuals wearing masks are moving a body to the edge of the flatbed where a gurney waits to transport the body . 
DOH spokesman Garrow confirmed that these pictures are , to the best of his knowledge , of the incident . 
The spokesman did not name the funeral home that Einstein says is responsible for the transportation of the bodies , but confirmed they did question Einstein employees as well as their contacts from the funeral home and the Medical Examiner ’s office .
