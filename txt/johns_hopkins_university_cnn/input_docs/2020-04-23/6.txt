German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Germany risks squandering the gains it has made in slowing down the spread of Covid 19 if the country opens up too quickly . 
The German federal and state governments recently agreed to a flurry of measures to loosen some of the physical distancing restrictions implemented to combat Covid 19 , including allowing smaller shops to reopen . 
After the loosening of some restrictions , many people flocked into shopping areas and pedestrian zones this week , leading top German virologists to warn against complacency . 
Merkel echoed those calls in her speech in parliament . 
Germany has reported more than 150,000 coronavirus infections , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The death toll has risen to 5,094 , the country â€™s center for disease control , the Robert Koch Institute said on Thursday .
