Vice President Mike Pence , on a swing of states with sharp rises in Covid 19 cases , has been changing his tone on the virus , declaring in Arizona and Florida that the country " will flatten the curve . " 
In recent remarks , Pence has said the curve has already been flattened . 
" We will slow the spread , " Pence said , alongside Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis and Dr . Deborah Birx on Thursday . 
" We will flatten the curve . 
And we will save lives and we will bring Florida ’s economy back bigger and better than ever before . " 
He made a similar statement in Arizona on Wednesday . 
As recently as two weeks ago , Pence said he was " proud to report " that " we slowed the spread . 
We flattened the curve . 
We cared for the most vulnerable , and we saved lives , " in remarks at a steel plant in Michigan . 
Even at the time , that was false . 
Case counts were on the increase or flat in most states , according to data provided by Johns Hopkins which tracks cases across the US . 
Speaking to reporters Thursday , Pence said the federal government is " considering " and will be " processing in very short order " a request for additional medical personnel to deal with coronavirus cases in Florida . 
But Pence still stressed the need to " keep opening back up our economy , " even as cases surge nationwide . 
" Even in these challenging times , " Pence said , " we ’re continuing to see America ’s economy coming back , Americans going back to work . " 
He also thanked the De Santis for his " efforts to open up Florida again , " before touting jobs numbers .
