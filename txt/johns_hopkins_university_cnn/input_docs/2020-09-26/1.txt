The US could see an explosion of Covid 19 cases as fall and winter set in , one expert says , joining a chorus of health officials who have warned about the challenges of the coming months . 
Two things will likely help drive that expected winter surge , according to Dr . Chris Murray , director of the University of Washington 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) . 
" First , as case counts have come down in some states , we tend to see that people become less careful , they tend to have more contact , " he said . 
" But then the most important effect is the seasonality of the virus , that people go indoors , transmission happens more . " 
According to the IHME model , the country is seeing about 765 daily deaths from Covid 19 , but that number could jump to 3,000 daily deaths by late December . 
More than 203,000 Americans have already died from the virus since the start of the pandemic and more than 7 million have been infected , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
At least 24 states are now reporting a rise in new cases compared to the previous week , mostly across the US heartland and Midwest , according to data from Johns Hopkins . 
Murray 's warning is one that 's been given by several other health officials in recent months . 
Over the summer , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director warned the fall and winter could be " one of the most difficult times that we experienced in American public health . " 
And this week , leading infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci urged American cities and counties to prepare for " the challenge " of fall and winter .
