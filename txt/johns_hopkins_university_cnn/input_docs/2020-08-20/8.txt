" Learning pods " may help families pool resources while keeping kids safe , but not every family has the means to take part , one expert said Thursday . 
Some parents are even sharing resources to hire tutors , but it â€™s something not many families can do , Anderson told a briefing sponsored by Johns Hopkins . 
She urged parents to carefully consider plans for their children this upcoming school year . 
" They need to really think about how they 're going to balance the academic needs but also some of the social emotional learning needs to students , so that they can make sure that it 's fair and balanced for everyone , " Anderson said . 
Anderson also noted concerns that some people may have trouble getting the supplies and equipment their kids need for online learning . 
" Despite the redoubling of efforts in districts to try to get devices to children , there 's still a backlog in the number of devices and hotspots that are available to some of our students , so we need to make sure that we are being more consistent and bringing everyone up to the same level if we 're going to deliver online content this fall , " she said .
