President Trump and first lady Melania Trump head to Mount Rushmore National Memorial on Friday to celebrate an early Fourth of July at a gathering of an estimated 7,500 people during a global pandemic . 
No social distancing is planned for the event despite the record high new coronavirus cases in the United States . 
And the event takes place amid environmental concerns over the use of fireworks in the dry land and as the country engages in a reckoning over its own monuments and racist history . 
" We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home , but those who want to come and join us , we 'll be giving out free face masks if they choose to wear one . 
But we wo not be social distancing , " Republican Gov . 
Kristi Noem said during a Monday appearance on Fox News . 
There may be health screening for ticketed guests in one area , according to recreation.gov . 
A recording on the park 's main telephone line Monday said : " There are no social distancing requirements in place at this time . " 
The 7,500 tickets for Friday 's event are lower than the typical visitor flow during the busy summer season . 
On normal days , 28,000 to 32,000 visitors come to Mount Rushmore during a 10 hour period . 
Amid the pandemic , the park never closed but visitation has been down to around 20,000 people , said Maureen Mc Gee Ballinger , Mount Rushmore 's chief of interpretation and education . 
Coronavirus cases in South Dakota currently remain stable , according to data from Johns Hopkins University , with 6,893 confirmed cases and 97 deaths as of Thursday -- but it remains to be seen how many attendees will travel from other states . 
Thirty six states are currently experiencing a rise in new cases .
