UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he 's concerned by a recent rise is Covid 19 cases in the country , adding that it has been most noticeable among " more affluent , younger people . " 
Hancock said the rise was " concerning because we 've seen a rise in cases in France , in Spain , in some other countries across Europe . 
And nobody wants to see a second wave here , " he told LBC radio . 
" It just reinforces the point that people must follow the social distancing rules – they 're so important . " 
The United Kingdom recorded 2,988 new Covid 19 cases in a 24 hour period -- the highest daily number since May -- according to government figures published on Sunday . 
" The rise in the number of cases we 've seen over the last few days is largely amongst younger people … under 25 's – especially between 17 and 21 ( years old ) , " Hancock said . 
He said even though younger people are at lower risk of dying from Covid 19 , there is a risk that they could infect other people . 
Asked whether the latest increase is following earlier trends of being worse in economically deprived and Black and ethnic minority communities , Hancock said it was more " broadly spread . " 
" Actually , it 's amongst more affluent , younger people especially that we 've seen the rise , " he said . 
The UK has recorded 349,500 cases of coronavirus , with at least 41,640 deaths , according to figures from Johns Hopkins University .
