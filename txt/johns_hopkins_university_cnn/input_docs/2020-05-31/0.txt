Venezuela will begin a partial reopening of nine economic sectors on June 1 , which will see them open for five days and then observe quarantine for the next ten , the country 's President Nicolas Maduro announced on Saturday . 
Border towns will not be part of the measure and the Venezuelan border will remain shut for the foreseeable future , Maduro said . 
During the ten days of quarantine , the food provision and health care sectors will be able to perform essential activities , according to the official Venezuelan News Agency . 
Venezuela has so far reported 1,459 cases of the novel coronavirus and 14 deaths , according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University . 
However , a recent report said that the real number is " almost certainly much higher , " citing the limited availability of reliable testing , poor transparency , and the " persecution of medical professionals and journalists who report on this issue . " 
The report also said that overcrowded prisons , packed living arrangements , malnutrition , limited access to water in homes and hospitals , and frequent migration across Venezuela ’s borders increased the risk of spreading the virus . 
The report was published by Human Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins University ’s Centers for Public Health and Human Rights and for Humanitarian Health .
