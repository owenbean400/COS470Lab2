Once again , misleading comparisons between the flu and Covid 19 caught widespread attention across the internet . 
That 's not true . 
Covid 19 is more lethal than the seasonal flu . 
Coronavirus The novel coronavirus has killed more than 210,700 people in the US in eight months , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
That 's an average of more than 867 Covid 19 deaths a day in the US since the first known death on February 6 . 
The flu The flu killed an estimated 22,000 people in the US during the last flu season , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
While the " exact timing and duration of flu seasons can vary , " the CDC says , most cases happen between October and May . If 22,000 people died between October 1 and May 31 , that would be an average of about 91 flu deaths a day over the span of eight months . 
And in just eight months , Covid 19 has killed more people than the flu did during the last five flu seasons combined . 
As for Trump 's claim that the flu kills " sometimes over 100,000 " people a year , CDC data from 1976 to 2007 and from 2010 until now show that 's not even close .
