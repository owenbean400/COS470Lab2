Trials by jury will be allowed to resume in Georgia , according to a release from the Supreme Court of Georgia . 
The state halted all jury trials five months ago due to the pandemic . 
" We have put into place rigorous safety protocols for grand jury proceedings and jury trials because we understand that the public must have confidence to come and serve on juries . 
It is paramount to all our judges that our citizens realize that their safety has been thoroughly considered , " Chief Justice Harold D . Melton said in a news release from the court . 
The chief justice intends to issue the order Saturday that will allow courts to resume jury trials , according to the release . 
The order will require courts to follow safety guidelines . 
While the court will allow trials to resume , they will not actually start right away since potential jurors will need to be summoned . 
In September , the Georgia Supreme Court allowed local courts to resume grand jury proceedings as longs as they could be " done safely and in compliance with public health guidance based on local conditions , " the chief justice said at the time . 
Georgia is home to more than 10 million people , according to the US Census . 
More than 7,000 have died and nearly 325,000 have been infected with Covid 19 , according to Johns Hopkins University .
