Citing the potential impact that the Thanksgiving holiday might have on the number of future Covid 19 cases , Vermont issued updated guidance to residents . 
Speaking on behalf of the Vermont Department of Health , Dr . Mark Levine said " my request to Vermonters who may have participated in travel or multi household gatherings is simply this : please quarantine yourselves at home and please get tested now and in seven days . " 
Citing rising case numbers , Levine pleaded with Vermonters to avoid any nonessential travel and any gatherings , particularly those between households . 
Despite lower levels of reported holiday and pre holiday air travel , various surveys conducted prior to Thanksgiving had estimated between a quarter and a third of all Americans planned to dine with people outside of their immediate household . 
" Such surveys probably underestimate reality , as people do not always want to freely admit doing what they have been told not to do , " acknowledged Levine . 
Nonetheless , Levine noted that Vermont was among the top three regions in the country with the fewest respondents planning on dining with others , the others being Washington state and the District of Columbia . 
Vermont 's numbers : The state has reported 4,005 cases of coronavirus and 67 deaths since the pandemic started . 
Note : These numbers were released by Vermont ’s public health agency and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
