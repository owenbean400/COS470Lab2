Singapore reported 344 new Covid 19 cases on Monday -- all but six of which were located in foreign worker dormitories . 
The government said in a statement that 99 % of those cases are linked to known clusters . 
Singapore initially appeared to have the pandemic under control , but a dramatic spike in cases among the city 's foreign workers -- who live in small , cramped spaces where it is easy for the virus to spread -- forced authorities in the city state to take drastic measures . 
Singapore is home to about 1.4 million migrant workers who come largely from South and Southeast Asia . 
As housekeepers , domestic helpers , construction workers and manual laborers , these migrants are essential to keeping Singapore functioning -- but are also some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable people in the city . 
The rate of infection among migrant workers appears to have slowed in recent days , and more appear to be recovering . 
The numbers : Singapore has confirmed 31,960 Covid 19 cases and 23 virus related deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The government said Tuesday that 862 more patients were discharged from medical facilities , and that 15,738 have recovered . 
Eight Covid 19 patients are in critical condition in ICUs , while upwards of 607 that are still in hospital are either stable or improving . 
The government said 15,592 patients who either have mild symptoms or are clinically well but still testing positive are being isolated .
