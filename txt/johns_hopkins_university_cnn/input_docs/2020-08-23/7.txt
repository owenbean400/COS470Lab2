The University of Kentucky began a second phase of Covid 19 testing Sunday , testing 5,500 students who belong to fraternities and sororities , according to a letter from the university ’s president . 
The university previously mandated Covid 19 testing for all students on campus , offering testing between August 3 and 22 . 
The second phase of testing comes following a roughly 3 % positivity rate for Covid 19 among fraternities and sororities in initial testing , approximately triple the roughly 1 % positivity rate for the general student population . 
Of the 49 students currently in isolation following a positive Covid test , 30 come from two fraternity houses , university spokesman Jay Blanton said in a news release . 
In a letter written to the campus community and provided to CNN , University President Eli Capilouto cautioned against blaming the students for the higher positivity rate . 
" Retesting has always been a part of our restart plan , " Capilouto wrote . 
" We will begin that process with the students for whom the data indicate retesting is most appropriate . " 
Capilouto said that 21,000 students had been tested in the initial phase . 
The university lists its enrollment as " more than 30,000 students . " 
According to the most recent data from Kentucky Public Health , the state has had a total of 43,529 Covid 19 cases since the pandemic began .
