At least 245 people with Covid 19 have died in the past 24 hours in the United Kingdom , the country 's Health department reported . 
This brings the official government total number of deaths in the UK to 41,128 . 
In addition , 170,379 Covid 19 tests were carried out on June 9 , with another 1,003 positive test results returning . 
In total , 290,143 people have tested positive in the UK . 
However , according to statistic bodies from all the nations within the UK , the Covid 19 death toll is higher . 
The total number of deaths with Covid 19 listed on a death certificate is at 50,413 , according to data from the Office of National Statistics of England and Wales , combined with data from statistics bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland . 
One thing to note : The ONS figure exceeds Johns Hopkins University ’s estimate because JHU ’s number comes from the UK Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) . 
That figure does not include all deaths that occurred outside hospitals and does not include cases that were diagnosed post mortem . 
Additionally , the ONS only reports deaths a week after they occur , which allows them to capture a more comprehensive picture .
