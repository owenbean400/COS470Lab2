Poland has shut down 12 coal mines after the country ’s health minister said most of its coronavirus cases had been identified at these " hotspots . " 
The mining region of Silesia has now had more than 10,000 confirmed cases , according to Health Ministry figures compiled by a volunteer data analyst . 
The total number of cases in Poland is at least 27,668 , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
At least two coal mines have more than 1,000 confirmed cases , according to figures supplied by coal companies to Polish business daily Gazeta Prawna . 
The government said miners would receive 100 % of their pay — unlike many other workers in the country , after businesses had to close from mid March under lockdown restrictions . 
Health Ministry spokesman Wojciech Andrusiewicz was quoted by Polsat News saying that 98 % of the cases in Silesia ’s coal mines were symptom free , and the high numbers were the result of a large number of tests being conducted . 
" No one before us has screened such an amount of symptom free cases , " the spokesman said , according to Polstat . 
Poland has a relatively low number of deaths per million residents , following early implementation of social distancing and lockdown measures , but in the last week of May the national R ( reproduction ) number , showing the spread of the virus , was 1.25 . 
In the Silesian Voivodeship ( province ) it was 2 . 
On May 27 , Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced an easing of coronavirus related restrictions . 
Starting on May 30 , Polish people were no longer required to cover their faces in public spaces . 
Social distancing guidelines recommending that people maintain a two meter distance from others are still in place . 
However , from June 6 events such as weddings were permitted to have up to 150 participants . 
Theaters , swimming pools and gyms are now allowed to open at 50 % capacity .
