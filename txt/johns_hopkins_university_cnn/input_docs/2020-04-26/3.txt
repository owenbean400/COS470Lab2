Spain 's children are finally allowed to leave their homes for the first time in over six weeks after the government announced a relaxation of the strictest confinement measures in Europe . 
In the capital Madrid , parents were seen by CNN venturing out with their children in tow on Sunday morning . 
Kids up to the age of 14 years old will now be able to play outside for one hour a day while accompanied by an adult , according to a decree by Spain ’s Official State Gazette ( BOE ) . 
The guidelines also stressed that children should be in groups no larger than three alongside one adult , and should not venture further than one kilometer ( 0.62 miles ) from their home . 
They are also allowed to bring their toys . 
This comes as the daily coronavirus death rate has dropped in the country , which also has the world ’s second highest number of coronavirus cases ( 223,759 ) , after the United States , according to Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) . 
Gradual easing : In a speech on Saturday evening , Spain Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced he will present his plan for the " de escalation phase " in his country next Tuesday . 
Sánchez told Spaniards that the country has had a small and modest victory , but there is a still a long way to go before they win the battle against coronavirus . 
The PM also announced that if Spain continues to show improvement , citizens will be allowed to go outside to play sports and walk with family members in early May . 
The country 's health minister will oversee the arrangements and guidance , he said . 
The process would be gradual , " asymmetrical " and coordinated , Sánchez emphasized .
