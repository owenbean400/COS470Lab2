Lancashire , in northwest England , will be placed under stringent restrictions after moving to the country 's highest Covid 19 alert level . 
The UK government had clashed with local leaders who wanted to avoid the measure , but the council officials agreed to the restrictions Friday . 
Under the government restrictions , pubs and bars not serving food will close and indoor social gatherings with people from different households are banned . 
The rules will be imposed from 12:01am Saturday . 
Officials also recommend against travelling in and out of the region , where cases have surged in recent days . 
Lancashire is the second region in England to be placed under Tier 3 rules after Liverpool earlier this week . 
The decision comes as talks between leaders in the separate Greater Manchester area and the UK government stalled . 
The government wants Manchester and surrounding areas to move to the highest alert level , but local leaders have rejected the request , fearing catastrophic economic damage . 
Britain is in the midst of a second Covid 19 wave . 
The country has reported a total of 676,455 cases , according to Johns Hopkins University .
