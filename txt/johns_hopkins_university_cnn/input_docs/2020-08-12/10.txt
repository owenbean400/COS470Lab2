Kentucky Gov . 
Andy Beshear today announced 1,163 new positive cases of Covid 19 , the single highest number of new positive cases the state has recorded since the start of the pandemic . 
The governor said the number includes both figures that would have been expected today , as well as those that had been delayed by a glitch in the system earlier in the week . 
He said the " original plan was to try to allocate those over the last couple of days where we thought they would have come in , and what we learned is it would not make a difference , either we 're going to have this number today or I think yesterday was going to be over 1,000 as well . " 
Remember : These numbers were released by the state ’s public health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
