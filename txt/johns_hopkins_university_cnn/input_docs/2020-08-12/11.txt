California has added 11,645 new coronavirus cases to its tally today , but more than half of those are the result of a backlog created by a data reporting error , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom announced in a news conference . 
These new cases bring California ’s total to 586,056 total infections . 
Newsom noted the 14 day hospitalization rates are down just over 19 % , and the two week rate for intensive care unit cases is down 16 % . 
These rates are " another indication that we are turning a corner on this pandemic , " Newsom said . 
The positivity rate of the virus continues to drop and currently stands at 6.2 % . 
This is down from just over 7 % for most of July . 
Some context : Data reporting errors that have plagued the state ’s recording system have been resolved , according to Newsom , with a parallel system in place for the short term and a long term replacement being created for the future . 
Note : These numbers were released by California Department of Public Health , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
