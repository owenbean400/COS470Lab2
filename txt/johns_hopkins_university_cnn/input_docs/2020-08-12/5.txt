Jordan will close its main land border crossing with Syria after a spike in local transmission of Covid 19 cases were introduced through its northern neighbor , according to the government . 
The decision to close the Jaber border crossing into Syria for a week starting on Thursday was made by the interior minister based on recommendations from a government committee overseeing borders and airport affairs , the Jordanian prime ministry said in a statement . 
Razzaz said the government will be reviewing measures at the all crossings including those with Iraq and Saudi Arabia . 
Land border crossings , which have been open to commercial traffic , are a vital trade lifeline for Jordan . 
" We have to reconsider our measures at the border crossings because they have become a source of transmission of the pandemic locally , " the prime minister said . 
At least 25 new locally transmitted cases were recorded in the 24 hour period since Tuesday morning , according to the prime minister . 
The Jordanian health minister , Dr . Saad Jaber , has been tasked with coordinating with relevant authorities on taking necessary health measures including quarantining workers at the Jaber border crossing , the government said in a statement . 
Some background : Jordan had one of the strictest lockdowns regimes in the world starting in March . 
The measures have kept the number of infections and deaths low compared to other countries . 
While restrictions have been eased domestically , all commercial air travel with the exception of repatriation flights remain suspended . 
Last week , Jordan postponed plans to resume flights to several countries deemed to be low risk for Covid 19 due to what it called " instability of the epidemiological situation worldwide " and " the sharp increase in Covid 19 cases . " 
According to Johns Hopkins University , Jordan has 1,283 confirmed cases and 11 deaths .
