A total of 10,015 people have died of Covid 19 in the US state of Massachusetts since March , according to state Department of Public Health data . 
Twenty one new deaths were reported by the state on Thursday , bringing the death toll past 10,000 . 
Cases have spiked dramatically in Massachusetts . 
Governor Charlie Baker said earlier this week that Covid 19 infections have increased by more than 300 % and hospitalizations by 200 % since Labor Day . 
The state is preparing for this surge by increasing hospital capacity and building field hospitals " where and when the needs are , " Baker said . 
These numbers were released by the Massachusetts ’s health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
