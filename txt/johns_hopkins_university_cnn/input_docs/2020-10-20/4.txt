Blood from the most severely ill Covid 19 patients may be the best for use in convalescent plasma therapy , according to a new study from Johns Hopkins University . 
Doctors have been using plasma , the liquid part of the blood that contains antibodies capable of fighting the virus , from recovered coronavirus patients to help treat Covid 19 . 
The researchers looked at samples of plasma from 126 Covid 19 survivors and found a wide variability in antibody levels and their ability to neutralize the coronavirus , the Johns Hopkins team wrote in their report , which was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation . 
Age and gender could be important , too . 
Older men who were hospitalized with Covid 19 and recovered are " strong candidates " for plasma donation , the analysis suggests . 
The sicker a person is with the virus , the stronger the antibody response , studies have shown . 
As clinical trials of convalescent plasma therapy are still ongoing , the researchers said doctors have had few guidelines on how to pick the best Covid 19 survivors with the strongest antibody responses to use in the treatment . 
Several other studies have also found that survivors whose disease was severe enough to warrant hospitalization have more antibodies to the coronavirus â€™ spike protein , a surface protein which enables the virus to attach and invade human cells .
