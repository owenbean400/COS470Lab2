The state of Tennessee will launch a surge testing effort on Nov . 23 ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday , health officials said during their weekly Covid 19 briefing . 
Dr . Lisa Piercey , commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health , said the idea is to extend hours at testing facilities and turn results around in 48 hours , so residents know their status going into the holiday . 
Gov . 
Bill Lee urged residents to think about how they carry on in their everyday lives . 
Lee said that Thanksgiving will not be the same for his family this year . 
Usually the extended family would usually gather at his mother ’s farm , but this year he encouraged Tennesseans to make this a " season of common sense " urging that personal responsibility is important . 
The state reported an increase of at least 1,841 new cases and 72 new deaths on Tuesday . 
Currently there are approximately 1,929 people hospitalized in the state . 
Note : These numbers were released by the Tennessee Department of Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
