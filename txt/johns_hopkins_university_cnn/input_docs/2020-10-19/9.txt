The city of Chicago , Illinois , is now in the second surge of Covid 19 , Mayor Lori Lightfoot said today during a press conference . 
" This is the second surge that Dr . Fauci and Dr . Arwady has been warning us about since March , " Lightfoot said . 
" We are now in it . " 
Contact tracing revealed two out of three Chicagoans who tested positive for Covid 19 contracted the virus from someone they know , according to Dr . Allison Arwady , the Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner . 
Over the past two weeks , the city is averaging about 500 new cases each day , Lightfoot said , adding that rising numbers is coinciding with " worrying increase of hospitalizations . " 
Additionally , the positivity rate over the past seven days stands at 5.4 % , with at least 88,412 total cases reported in the city since the pandemic began , according the Department of Public Health 's dashboard . 
The mayor said that if there is not a " dramatic turnaround , " the city will have to revert to phase three restrictions , which allows gatherings of 10 people or fewer and for bars and restaurants to be open only for delivery , pickup and drive through .
