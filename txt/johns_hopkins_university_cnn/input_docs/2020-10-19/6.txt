27 states are showing upward trends . 
21 states are showing steady trends .

Instead of seeing restrictions as a roadblock to an open economy , Fauci told CBS News Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Jonathan La Pook during the interview the fatigued American public should see public health measures as a way to safely keep it open . 
Americans can help get the virus under control , experts say , by heeding guidelines touted by officials for months : avoiding crowded settings , keeping a distance , keeping small gatherings outdoors and wearing a mask .
