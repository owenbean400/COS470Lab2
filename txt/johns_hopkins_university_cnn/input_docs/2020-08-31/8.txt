Movie theaters and indoor performances venues in New Jersey can reopen with restrictions on capacity starting Friday , Gov .

Following the governor ’s announcement , New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli emphasized the importance of ventilation for all indoor businesses . 
" Please — do not go out to eat if you are not feeling well , " she added . 
Asked if he would reinstate indoor dining restrictions if Covid 19 trends worsened , Murphy said he would , but with the supporting data . 
" I certainly hope not to , and it would be a sustained increase , " he said . 
" It would not be ( due to ) one day or even a couple of days ( of increased infections ) , " Murphy said , adding that he would want to have " some qualitative sense around the data as to whether or not it was coming from the indoor dining steps that we 've taken as opposed to some out of control party in somebody 's basement . "

The state 's positivity rate is currently at 1.41 % , she said .
