In South Africa , spreading false information about the coronavirus is now a crime , punishable by up to six months in prison , a fine , or both . 
The move is one of several new measures announced by the government late Wednesday , in an effort to halt the spread of the virus and curb misleading rumors on social media . 
Other measures include legally enforcing testing , treatment and quarantine or isolation of suspected cases . 
Earlier this week , a family in Gauteng province refused to be isolated after testing positive and had to be brought in by police after a court order . 
Visits to prisons have been suspended , and gatherings of more than 100 people are now prohibited by law . 
Gatherings of more than 50 people will also be banned if alcohol is present . 
South Africa has 116 cases of the coronavirus , according to Johns Hopkins University -- most of them imported from overseas .
