Although the ideal Covid 19 vaccine would completely prevent infection , a shot that reduces severe illness and mortality is still a success , Naor Bar Zeev , deputy director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins University , said Wednesday . 
Herd immunity , which is when enough of a population is immune to an infectious disease that the spread from person to person is unlikely , is not on the cards for the next few years , Bar Zeev said , as the number of doses available of vaccine will be insufficient to produce it . 
" What we want to do is reduce severe disease among the people at highest risk , " he said . 
" So a vaccine that does that but allows infection to carry on , you know causing a mild cold , fantastic , bring it on , that â€™s wonderful . " 
He also pointed out that herd immunity would require more than just an effective vaccine . 
It also requires community participation and coverage . 
" If 50 % of Americans do not want to be vaccinated , for example , because of hesitancy or safety concerns , then even a 100 % effective vaccine wo not achieve herd immunity , " he said .
