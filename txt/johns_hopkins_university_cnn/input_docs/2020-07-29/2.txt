The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until August 31 , its Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at a news conference on Tuesday . 
The lockdown will largely be a " general " one , meaning essential services will run and industrial activity will be allowed . 
But in nine days in August , the east Indian state will go into a " complete " lockdown , with everyone required to stay indoors . 
West Bengal has 60,830 cases of coronavirus including 1,411 deaths and 39,917 recoveries , according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , as of Wednesday . 
" We need to break the chain ... 
If we can block the virus even to a certain extent we should take whatever steps we can , " Banerjee said . 
" A lot of people think that the numbers are too high , but earlier we had one lab for tests , now we have 56 , " she said . 
Banerjee added that the state 's health infrastructure had improved significantly in the last eight to nine years . 
India has more than 1.5 million coronavirus cases , the third highest tally in the world according to Johns Hopkins University .
