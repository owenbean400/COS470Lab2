Washington Gov . 
Jay Inslee signed an order Wednesday night paving the way for the state to release hundreds of prisoners within the next week . 
The inmates will be released due to health concerns caused by the coronavirus . 
The decision was prompted by a state Supreme Court order for Washington to address hazardous health conditions after more than a half dozen prisoners at a minimum security facility in Monroe tested positive for Covid 19 . 
What the order says : Under Inslee â€™s order , all inmates serving time for non violent and non sexual offenses who were scheduled to be set free by June 29 of this year are eligible for early release . 
The order does not say exactly how many inmates will be freed , but a court document filed Monday said the state ultimately expected to release between 600 and 950 prisoners early . 
Inslee said in a news conference Wednesday that the state is legally required to minimize prisoners ' chances of getting the coronavirus while incarcerated . 
The Department of Corrections has been ordered to " make reasonable efforts " to notify victims of crime about the release at least 48 hours in advance -- but that is not a requirement . 
Washington state has reported at least 10,942 coronavirus cases , including 552 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
