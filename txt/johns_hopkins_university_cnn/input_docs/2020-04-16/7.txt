The plant remains closed , Tyson Foods said . 
In Iowa , the drastic jump in Covid 19 cases in Louisa County has come largely from the Tyson meat packing plant there . 
Of Iowa ’s 189 new positive cases statewide , 86 are tied to the Columbus Junction Tyson plant . 
Iowa has reported a total of at least 1,995 coronavirus cases , including 53 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
