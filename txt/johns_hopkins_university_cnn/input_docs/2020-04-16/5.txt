A Hawaii National Guard unit that was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan for a year returns home Wednesday night local time . 
But they will not get their usual reunion ceremony due to coronavirus concerns . 
Brig . Gen . Moses Kaoiwi , Jr . announced Wednesday that only two family members of each soldier can be present when the 1st Battalion , 47th Field Artillery returns . 
" This will be the most physically distant reunion ceremony in our history , " Kaoiwi said . 
" It is not ideal , but it is necessary . " 
The soldiers â€™ loved ones who attend the event will not be allowed to get out of their cars , Kaoiwi announced . 
It comes as the Guard is tripling the number of members working on the Covid 19 response . 
As of Thursday , 1,200 Guardsmen will be on active duty for the state emergency . 
Hawaii has reported at least 524 coronavirus cases , including nine deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
