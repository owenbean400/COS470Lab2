More than 10,000 people have died after contracting the novel coronavirus , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University . 
The grim milestone comes nearly three months after the virus was first identified in Wuhan , the capital of China 's Hubei province . 
Since then , the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica and infected nearly 250,000 people worldwide , by JHU 's estimates . 
The university is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources . 
The situation in Europe and the United States is getting increasingly dire . 
Italy 's death toll surpassed that of mainland China yesterday , and according to Johns Hopkins , the country has now recorded more than 41,000 cases . 
Infections in the US surpassed 10,000 on Thursday , up from fewer than 100 at the beginning of the month . 
There may be even more , as not all patients can be tested because the US is currently dealing with a severe shortage of testing equipment . 
Progress at pandemic ground zero : Authorities in mainland China appear to be making notable progress in stopping the virus from spreading domestically -- no new local infections have been reported for two days in a row and 71,150 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital , according to the country 's National Health Commission .
