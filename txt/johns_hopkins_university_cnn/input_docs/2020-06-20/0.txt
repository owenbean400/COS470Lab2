The Brazilian health ministry said the country ’s record spike in newly reported coronavirus cases was due in part to " instability " in how a few populous states reported their data . 
On Friday , Brazil reported 54,711 fresh cases -- higher than the largest single day increase in the United States , which reported 48,529 new cases on April 25 , according to a CNN tally based on Johns Hopkins University data . 
The ministry said the large number of cases reported Friday was partly due to " instability in the routine of exporting data related , principally , to the states of Bahia , Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo on Thursday June 18 . " 
The state of São Paulo -- Brazil ’s most populous state and the epicenter of the country 's Covid 19 outbreak -- reported 1,111 new coronavirus cases on Thursday and 19,030 on Friday . 
The health ministry note on Friday said " it is worth noting that the conclusion of the epidemiological week on Saturday 6/20 will allow for a more precise evaluation of the variation in new cases this week in relation to last week . " 
The spike came as Brazil became only the second country worldwide to surpass 1 million reported cases , after the US .
