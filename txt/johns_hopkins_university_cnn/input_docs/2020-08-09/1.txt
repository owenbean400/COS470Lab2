The US inched closer to 5 million cases of Covid 19 on Saturday as experts warned the country is still not doing enough to contain the spread of the coronavirus . 
" We need to take ownership of this and implement a federal plan by which we bring every state to containment by October , " said Dr . Peter Hotez , a professor and Dean of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine , adding that some states have been able to do that already . 
" But other parts of the country have a lot of work to do , " Hotez told CNN Saturday . 
On Saturday , the California Department of Health reported 7,371 new cases and the Florida Department of Health reported more than 8,400 cases . 
Health officials in Texas said the state 's seven day Covid 19 test positivity rate had risen to 19.41 % â€” the highest seven day average since the pandemic began . 
" The point is , " Hotez said , " it 's all doable if we have leadership at the White House that tells us we need to do this . " 
The US had more than 4.9 million confirmed cases as of Saturday evening , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
