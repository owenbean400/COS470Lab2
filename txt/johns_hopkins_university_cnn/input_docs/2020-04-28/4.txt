Dr . Chris Murray , director of the University of Washington ’s Institute for Help Metrics and Evaluation , told CNN Tonight that they ’ve adjusted their scientific model to increase the predicted death toll from the novel coronavirus to 74,000 . 
The model had previously forecast 60,000 deaths from Covid 19 . 
Murray said this data would also impact their recommendations on when social distancing could be relaxed on a state by state basis . 
He said their recommendations would shift out past the mid May to early June dates they had previously suggested . 
Murray said he thinks that states are opening too early . 
" If you ’re focused on trying to protect people ’s health , then the answer is absolutely . 
It ’s a safer strategy to get the number of infections in the community down to a really low level and then testing and contact tracing and isolation can work , " Murray said . 
More than 56,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the US , according to Johns Hopkins University .
