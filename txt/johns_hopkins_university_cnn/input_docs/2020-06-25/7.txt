At home testing could help with diagnosis and control of Covid 19 and help with preparedness for possible future pandemics , according to a new report published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security on Thursday . 
Home tests for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , are a good model for home tests for influenza and , eventually , coronavirus , the report suggests . 
Home tests could solve problems with access to testing , as well , the report says . 
Plus , when people test at home , they do not have to worry about catching or spreading the virus by going somewhere to get tested . 
" Had at home testing been widely available early in the COVID 19 pandemic , it would have allowed people to be tested while maintaining social distancing in the process , thus potentially contributing to reduced spread of the virus , " the report reads . 
A successful program for developing and approving home tests could be expanded to cover other infections , too , and improve knowledge of the spread and extent of viruses and bacteria . 
The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and other agencies should prioritize funding , development and review of these products , the Johns Hopkins team said .
