Ecuador 's vice president warned on Wednesday that public hospitals in the country 's capital , Quito , have reached capacity from the coronavirus pandemic . 
Speaking at a news conference , Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner said that hospitals in Quito are feeling the strain after seeing an increase of Covid 19 patients . 
Sonnenholzner said that Ecuador plans to increase availability of intensive care units and hospital beds to help mitigate the strain . 
Sonnenholzner also said they have learned from the city of Guayaquil , where overwhelmed hospitals prevented many people impacted by the virus from receiving treatment in March and April . 
The vice president said Ecuador 's changes will bring a higher possibility that a patient will get the medical care they need . 
Quito is now second after Guayaquil with the most number of confirmed Covid 19 cases , according to the country â€™s health ministry . 
On June 3 the capital entered a " yellow light " phase , considered as mid level risk , which allows some mobility restrictions to be lifted and the reopening of some businesses . 
Ecuador has reported 51,643 coronavirus cases , and 4,274 deaths from the virus , according to Johns Hopkins University .
