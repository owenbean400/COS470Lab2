A law extending France 's state of emergency went into effect today , a day after lockdowns began lifting across the country . 
The state of emergency law gives the government the power to enforce measures to avoid a second Covid 19 peak . 
France has been in a state of emergency since March 17 and the new law extends this through July 10 . 
The law gives the state the power to enforce measures like restricting travel to within 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) from home , making masks mandatory on public transport , and banning gatherings of more than 10 people . 
The bill passed through parliament this weekend and was reviewed by the Constitutional Court on Monday . 
The court removed some provisions , such as allowing the government to mandate quarantine for overseas travelers without a judge â€™s order . 
It also reinforced privacy protections around the personal data that would be collected in a tracing system that has yet to be developed . 
France has reported 177,547 total Covid 19 cases and 26,646 related deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Lockdown lifted : The country eased lockdown measures on Monday for the first time in more than 50 days . 
In Paris , traffic returned to the Champs Elysees , shops reopened , and people gathered with friends on the banks of the River Seine .
