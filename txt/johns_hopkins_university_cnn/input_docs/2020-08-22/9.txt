Incoming students planning to attend Northeastern University in Boston , Massachusetts , this fall will need to find another school if they do not agree to follow the university 's social gathering guidelines , according to a letter published Saturday on the school 's website . 
New students who say they plan to either host or attend parties will have their offers of admission rescinded , according to the letter from Madeleine Estabrook , the university 's senior vice chancellor for student affairs . 
The schools also will take action against current students who partake in social gatherings . 
The letter comes after the university says it was made aware of " several students expressing on social media their intent to gather in large groups and to engage in parties . " 
Estabrook wrote those students have been contacted directly by her office . 
As of Saturday , Massachusetts has had 115,850 confirmed cases of Covid 19 since the start of the outbreak , according to the state 's official tally .
