South Korea is extending Seoul 's strict social distancing measures nationwide as the country battles a fresh coronavirus spike . 
The announcement , by Health Minister Park Neung hoo , comes as an outbreak linked to the Sarang Jeil church continues to spread . 
The country recorded 332 new infections on Friday , with more than 75 % of the 315 locally transmitted cases found in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area . 
Seoul was placed under heightened social distancing measures on August 16 . 
Clubs , karaoke bars and internet cafes were closed , and sports events could only be held without spectators . 
Indoor gatherings were limited to 50 people , while a maximum of 100 people were allowed to gather outdoors . 
Park said those measures would be rolled out to the entire country -- although provinces with few cases could follow them as a recommendation rather than a mandate . 
South Korea has reported a total of 17,002 cases , including 309 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
