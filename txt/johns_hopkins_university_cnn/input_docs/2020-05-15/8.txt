People in the Philippines who have evacuated their homes to shelter from Typhoon Vongfong still need to follow social distancing in evacuation centers , according to an article in the state run Philippine News Agency . 
Typhoon Vongfong , the first named storm of the 2020 season in the Western Pacific , made landfall in the Philippines around noon local time yesterday -- forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people in a country under coronavirus lockdown . 
At least 200,000 people live in coastal areas near the affected area on the island of Samar in the Eastern Visayas region . 
To make sure people can still adhere to social distancing , emergency evacuation centers are cutting their capacity by half . 
Families inside will need to huddle together to maintain safe distances from other households , and local officials will enforce these guidelines inside the centers , according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque . 
The storm is now a minimal typhoon with winds of 120 kph ( 75 mph ) . 
It will move through the Luzon region over the next 24 to 48 hours . 
The Philippines has officially recorded nearly 12,000 coronavirus cases , including at least 790 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
