An influential model of the coronavirus pandemic predicts 385,611 coronavirus deaths in the United States by February 1 . 
The US has reported at least 223,000 Covid 19 deaths over the past eight months , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The model estimates that the country could see more than 100,000 additional deaths over the next three months . 
The new model is slightly fewer than last week â€™s forecast for the same time frame -- but the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine says case counts and deaths are up across the US . 
Last week , the IHME projected 389,087 coronavirus deaths in the US by February 1 . 
The current projections assume states will reimpose social distancing mandates when daily death rates worsen . 
The model projects 100,000 more deaths if all mandates were eased -- an unlikely scenario -- and 322,000 deaths if everyone started wearing masks .
