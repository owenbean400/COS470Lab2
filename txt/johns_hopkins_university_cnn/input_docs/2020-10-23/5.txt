Nightclubs where dancing is permitted will be limited to a capacity of 50 people in Sweden , Prime Minister Stefan Lofven announced Thursday . 
The tightening of nightclub restrictions -- still lenient compared with other European countries where nightlife has all but ceased -- comes as the country sees a spike in coronavirus infections . 
Sweden reported 1,614 new cases in the past 24 hours . 
The record was set on Tuesday with 3,180 new cases , according to Johns Hopkins University data . 
Venues that do not allow for dancing but serve food and beverages for seated customers at a safe distance do not have to limit numbers . 
Meanwhile rules on sporting and other events have been relaxed to allow up to 300 spectators where they can be seated at a safe distance . 
Currently , 50 spectators are allowed . 
The changes will come into effect on November 1 .
