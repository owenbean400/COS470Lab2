Dr . William Moss , an infectious disease pediatrician at Johns Hopkins University , encouraged anyone who has already tested positive for Covid 19 to get vaccinated once a vaccine becomes available . 
" This too is a very important question , and it also is sometimes framed as , you know , if someone had Covid 19 , should they get the vaccine , and the general recommendations now are yes , " Moss said during a John Hopkins webinar on Covid 19 vaccine distribution on Monday . 
Moss said there have been different levels of immune responses , depending on the severity of the disease in the individual . 
" People who have asymptomatic or very mild infections tend not to have as strong an antibody response as people who have been sicker . 
We certainly do not want that , " he said . 
Moss added there is some potential that someone who has already tested positive for Covid 19 can produce a stronger antibody response once vaccinated . 
However , this is not the case for all vaccines , he said .
