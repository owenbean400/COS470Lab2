A record 101,487 Covid 19 patients were in US hospitals on Sunday , according to the Covid Tracking Project , underscoring the immense pressure on the nation 's hospitals and health care workers . 
" Our hospitals are already at the brink , " said CNN medical analyst Dr . Leana Wen , a former Baltimore City health commissioner . 
" And they are just at the brink of becoming so overwhelmed that patients are going to get less than ideal care . " 
Already stretched thin , experts and health care workers fear things will only get worse , with a potential surge of infections fueled by Thanksgiving travel and gatherings . 
Just one week after the holiday , the US has yet to feel the full effects . 
But Wen said we will see an " exponential rise " in cases in the next few weeks , and she urged Americans do their part to combat the spread of the virus and relieve the strain on hospitals . 
December has brought the highest hospitalization numbers in the US since the pandemic began as the virus continues to spread like wildfire . 
It took almost 100 days for the US to reach 1 million coronavirus infections after the first cases were confirmed on January 20 . 
But in the first five days of the month , from Tuesday to Saturday , 1,000,882 cases were reported in the US , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
More than 14.7 million confirmed cases had been reported in the US as of Sunday night , and more than 282,200 people have died .
