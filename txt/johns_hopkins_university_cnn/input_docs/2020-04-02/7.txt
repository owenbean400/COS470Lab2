Kenya 's President Uhuru Kenyatta apologized Wednesday for violence and harsh tactics used by police last week to enforce a nationwide coronavirus curfew . 
Police have been accused of using batons and tear gas to disperse crowds in the city of Mombasa to enforce the curfew . 
" I know especially when we introduced the curfew , maybe in the initial stages , there were some challenges , " Kenyatta said in a televised speech . 
" And I want to apologize to all Kenyans maybe for some excesses that were conducted or happened , " he said . 
" But I want to assure you , that if we work together , if we all understand that this problem needs all of us , and if we all pull in the same direction , we will overcome . " 
According to the latest figures by Johns Hopkins University , there have been 81 confirmed coronavirus cases in Kenya and one death .
