Every day , Filipina nurse April Abrias walks six miles to monitor 30 patients who are suspected to have the novel coronavirus in a rural province north of the Philippine capital , Manila . 
The 29 year old midwife does not have a surgical mask to cover her face -- instead , she wears a cloth mask that provides insufficient protection from the virus , which has killed more than 47,000 people worldwide , according to figures from Johns Hopkins University . 
At least 17 frontline coronavirus medics have already died in the Philippines , and more than 600 have been in quarantine , according to CNN Philippines .

One of her patients lives in a fruit and vegetable market , which as an essential service is not subject to the same lockdown rules that have silenced busy streets across the island of Luzon since March 17 . 
Abrias said the patient had a fever and body aches , so she told him to self quarantine in his shop and avoid interacting with others .
