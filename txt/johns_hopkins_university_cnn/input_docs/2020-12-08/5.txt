Arizona has posted a record setting number of new Covid 19 cases today â€” 6,973 new cases , according to the state 's data dashboard . 
Today 's case count replaces the old record high of 5,442 cases that was set on Dec . 3 . 
Arizona did report a massive 10,322 new Covid 19 cases on Dec . 1 , but the state 's health department said " this large number of newly reported cases is a result of the extended four day weekend . "
