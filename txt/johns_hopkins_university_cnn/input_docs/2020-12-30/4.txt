California recorded 432 new fatalities , the highest reported in a single day so far . 
In Southern California , Los Angeles County officials described the grim situation there in a tweet Wednesday , and said one person dies from Covid 19 every 10 minutes .

The number of people who have died from the virus in the Golden State is nearly 25,000 . 
Gov .

California added 30,921 cases Wednesday , bringing the state ’s total to more than 2.2 million Covid 19 infections . 
More than 746,000 of those are in Los Angeles County , the nation ’s most populous .

Hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain at an all time high . 
ICU capacity is down to 0 % statewide , with the brunt of the impact in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley .
