The University of Washington now projects there will be 230,822 US deaths from Covid 19 by November , based on the current scenario . 
On July 22 , the university â€™s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) forecasted 219,864 total deaths from the virus by November . 
The latest update reflects an increase of about 11,000 deaths due to an increase in infections and the refusal by some people to wear masks , to practice social distancing , and to perform other measures to mitigate the transmission of the virus . 
If the US universally adopted wearing masks , the number of deaths by November would drop to nearly 198,831 , the model projected . 
The use of masks is up but not as high as it should be across the nations . 
However , there has been a rise in mask wearing across states and locations with increased cases and deaths , the IHME said . 
Some context : So far , according to Johns Hopkins University , more than 4.47 million Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus infections and at least 151,674 have died . 
" We would like for Americans to keep their guard up to reduce the transmission of the virus . 
We do not have an effective drug and vaccines are on their way , so prevention is key . " 
Mokdad told CNN .
