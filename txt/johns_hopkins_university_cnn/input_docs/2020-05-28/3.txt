Public health experts have regularly praised South Korea 's response to the global pandemic , which emphasized widespread testing and contact tracing in order to stop the virus spread . 
To date , 11,344 Covid 19 cases and 269 virus related deaths have been confirmed , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University .
