The University of Washington has slightly lowered its projection of how many people are likely to die from coronavirus in the United States by October 1 . 
The university â€™s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) now forecasts 175,168 total deaths by October 1 , based on the current scenario . 
But if almost everyone wears a face mask , that number would fall to just over 150,000 , the IHME projected . 
Last week , the IHME forecast 179,106 deaths by October 1 if nothing changed but said that would drop to 146,000 if 95 % of Americans started wearing masks in public . 
The current model shows daily deaths leveling out starting this week -- at 630 or so deaths a day -- and staying fairly constant if states continue to ease their restrictions on economic activity . 
It shows daily death rates dropping fast to just 71 deaths a day with universal mask requirements , however . 
So far , according to Johns Hopkins University , more than 2.5 million Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus infections and at least 126,000 have died .
