Now is " no time to pop the champagne bottles " despite the fact that construction has stopped on temporary field hospitals , New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo warned . 
New York state identified and received federal government approval for eight facilities for use as temporary field hospitals , CNN previously reported . 
However , as of Tuesday , not all are needed or in use at this time , according to a state government administration official . 
If the need for hospital beds or facilities spikes then " we ’re ready to re engage with our federal partners , " the official said . 
But while new construction has stopped on temporary field hospitals , Cuomo said he is not ready to stop those projects completely . 
" We stopped any new construction when we saw the rates starting to stabilize but I ’m not ready to close anything down yet , either , " Cuomo said Tuesday night . 
" Now you have some health experts , CDC today starts to warn about an outbreak in the fall , I do not even want to think about that yet . " 
New York state has recorded more than 258,000 coronavirus cases , including at least 19,114 deaths , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University .
