Indonesia has banned all citizens from traveling to their hometowns for Eid al Fitr celebrations in an effort to contain the spread of novel coronavirus , the country â€™s President Joko Widodo said Tuesday . 
Millions of people normally go back to their hometowns to see their families every year in a homecoming tradition known as " mudik , " the report said . 
Jokowi did not provide specifics on how the ban will be enforced .

Indonesia has recorded more than 7,000 coronavirus cases and at least 616 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
