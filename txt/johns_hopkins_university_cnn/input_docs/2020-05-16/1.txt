UNICEF is building a 210 bed isolation and treatment center in Cox 's Bazar , home to the world 's biggest refugee camp , after two people there tested positive for the novel coronavirus . 
Nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees live in the camp to escape violence and persecution in neighboring Myanmar . 
One of the confirmed cases was a Rohingya refugee , while the other was a Bangladeshi citizen who lives in the area surrounding the camps , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement . 
Bangladesh has more than 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus , with 298 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Government response : The Bangladeshi government suspended most of the services within the densely populated camps in late March , including educational programs and other advocacy work . 
Health officials have now begun to treat both patients while isolating and testing other refugees in the camps , the agency said . 
Covid in the camps is " a nightmare " : " The first positive case of Covid 19 in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh is the realization of a nightmare scenario , " said Daniel P . Sullivan , a senior advocate for human rights with the US based organization Refugees International .
