France is slowly reopening today after almost two months of strict lockdown throughout the country . 
Most shops will reopen Monday as planned , in what Prime Minister Edouard Philippe previously said would be a " very gradual process . " 
Some areas will face stricter measures than others , with Philippe saying the country would be " divided in two . " 
France will be split into red and green zones , with lockdown measures stricter in red areas . 
Primary school students across the whole country will return to school on Monday , with classes limited to 15 students . 
The French government has warned that strict restrictions could be reinstated if people do not respect social distancing rules . 
There are widespread concerns that opening society too quickly could spark a second wave of coronavirus cases throughout the country . 
177,094 cases have been recorded across France , according to a Johns Hopkins University tally . 
Elsewhere , a bill extending the country 's state of emergency was redirected to France 's Constitutional Court for review . 
The redirection means the law is effectively not in place Monday . 
The halted emergency law limits non essential travel in France to 100 kilometers and limits access to Paris ' public transport system to people with official documentation . 
The constitutional council is expected to issue a judgment tonight on the delayed law . 
The council will consider the bill " in order to ensure better legal guarantees around the implementation of the lockdown measures , " according to a joint press release issued on Monday by the official residence of French President Emmanuel Macron , and the office of France 's prime minister .
