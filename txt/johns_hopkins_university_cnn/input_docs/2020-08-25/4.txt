Coronavirus in California continues to spread , but the numbers show stabilization of transmission , Health Secretary Mark Ghaly said in a briefing . 
The positivity rates are 5.7 % over the past week , and 6.3 % over 14 days . 
Both numbers are down from two weeks ago , a month ago , and two months ago , Ghaly noted . 
Hospitalizations and those in intensive care units are down close to 20 % . 
California reported at least 673,095 cases and approximately 12,257 Covid related deaths , according to the state 's Department of Public Health . 
While sharing the promising data , Ghaly warned , " This sneaky virus that we call Covid 19 does not take a rest . 
It will find every opportunity to transmit from person to person because that ’s what germs do . 
It ’s no surprise . " 
New guidelines for different business sectors are expected to be announced later this week in an effort to safely reopen more businesses in areas that have a handle on the virus . 
One wildcard in the effort to quell the virus are the massive wildfires tormenting the state . 
" It ’s hard to tell , " Ghaly said , " whether the actions or mixing of people due to wildfires have had an impact on Covid transmission . " 
About 136,000 people have been evacuated due to the threat of wildfire and more than 3,600 are being housed at evacuation shelters . 
Safeguards are in place and have largely been followed , Ghaly said . 
But he added that he would not be surprised to see increased transmission in those areas . 
NOTE : These numbers were released by California Department of Public Health and the Los Angeles Department of Public Health , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
