Less than a month ago , Singapore was being hailed as one of the countries that had got its coronavirus response right . 
Encouragingly for the rest of the world , the city state seemed to have suppressed cases without imposing the restrictive lockdown measures endured by millions elsewhere . 
And then the second wave hit , hard . 
Since March 17 , Singapore 's number of confirmed coronavirus cases grew from 266 to over 5,900 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
So what went wrong ? 
Migrant workers : The answer appears to lie in overlooked clusters of cases among migrant workers living in cramped dormitories and an underestimation of the speed at which those infections could spread through a city where lockdown measures had not been put in place . 
Life as normal : Because Singapore was testing widely and isolating all those who were potentially contagious , it was able to remain relatively open and continue functioning as usual . 
This attitude was only viable if infections from overseas were kept out , and new potential cases were detected and dealt with quickly . 
Rapid spread : Once this measure failed , the speed at which the virus could pass from person to person was greater than it would be in a place with heavy lockdown and social distancing measures .
