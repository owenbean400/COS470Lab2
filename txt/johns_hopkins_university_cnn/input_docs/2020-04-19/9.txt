Singapore reported 942 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday -- the highest daily jump so far , according to a statement from the city state 's Ministry of Health . 
Most of the cases involve migrant workers living in dormitories , according to the ministry , which said that only 14 of the 942 new cases were Singapore citizens or permanent residents . 
After initial success in mitigating the spread of the virus , Singapore has seen a recent spike in cases , including an outbreak among foreign workers who typically live in cramped dormitories . 
The government responded with what it called a " circuit breaker " in early April , banning all social gatherings and closing schools and most workplaces . 
Singapore recently announced that it would move uninfected foreign workers in essential services into alternative living arrangements such as military camps , vacant government apartments and floating hotels . 
" The numbers in the migrant worker dorms are still going up , " Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote on his Facebook page on Saturday . 
Singapore has so far recorded a total of 6,588 cases of coronavirus with 11 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
