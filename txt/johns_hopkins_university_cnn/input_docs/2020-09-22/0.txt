As most US states head in the wrong direction with coronavirus , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has retracted key information about how the virus spreads . 
The US is on the brink of 200,000 coronavirus deaths , with the number of new cases rising in 28 states , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
" And it 's happening because we 're forcing schools to reopen in areas of high transmission . 
We 're forcing colleges to reopen , and we do not have the leadership nationally , telling people to wear masks and to social distance and do all the things we need to do . " 
Dr . Jeanne Marrazzo , director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , said she agrees this fall " could be apocalyptic " after recent spikes . 
" Why are we going back up ? 
I think there are a few reasons , " Marrazzo said . 
" One is that there is general fatigue . 
People are really tired of this , " she said . 
" And then the second thing is ... the completely contradictory messages that we 're getting -- not just the misinformation , but also the confusion about how things are spread . " 
CDC reversal : She cited a recent update from the CDC that said you can get Covid 19 just by inhaling tiny particles from an infected person 's breath that linger or travel in the air . 
Many doctors have known that for months -- hence their pleas for the public to wear masks . 
" The updated guidance would have been fine if it came out last May , " Hotez said . 
" We knew all of these things months ago . " But by Monday afternoon , the CDC 's update was removed .
