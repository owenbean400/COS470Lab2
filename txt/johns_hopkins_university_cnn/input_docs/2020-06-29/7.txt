Rhode Island will impose a mandatory 14 day quarantine starting Tuesday for people coming from a state with a 5 % or greater positivity rate , Gov . 
Gina Raimondo announced on Monday . 
If a traveler can attest to having a negative Covid 19 test within the past 72 hours , then a quarantine will not be required , she added . 
That would be done on an " honor system . " 
She said the state will enforce the rule through widespread signage and working closely with the local tourism industry to make sure individuals are made aware of the rule . 
The state will not be stopping people with out of state license plates to enforce the rule . 
It is not clear what the penalties will be for violating the quarantine . 
The quarantine rule currently applies to 23 states as of Monday , and Rhode Island will keep a list of states impacted by the rule updated weekly based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University , Raimondo said .
