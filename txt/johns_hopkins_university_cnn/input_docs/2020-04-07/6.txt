German officials warned today that the country should expect to see a rise in coronavirus deaths because of outbreaks in care homes and assisted living facilities . 
There will likely be no letting up of new cases in the coming days , warned the president of the Robert Koch Institute , a federal government research agency . 
There were 3,834 new cases and 173 deaths yesterday , the institute said . 
That brings the national total to 103,375 cases and 1,810 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
These figures do not reflect the number of active cases , as many patients have since recovered and been discharged from hospital ; rather , it represents the total number of infections since the pandemic began . 
Germany has enough intensive care unit beds : Lothar Wieler , head of the Robert Koch Institute , said the country has sufficient ICU capacity for the time being . 
" I am happy about each bed and each ventilator , " he said . 
However , he cautioned that capacity could run out in the future .
