Alarming Covid 19 case increases in Los Angeles County could lead to a shortage of both regular hospital beds and intensive care beds within the next two to four weeks if the current trajectory holds . 
Health Services Director Dr . Christina Ghaly presented the grim outlook for Los Angeles County , which is mid surge with 4,311 new cases announced Wednesday . 
Ghaly estimates that one in every five residents has had Covid 19 and about one in 145 are currently infectious . 
Nearly 60 % of those who are infected are not currently experiencing pronounced symptoms . 
Average daily cases climbed 113 % during the first two weeks of November , and hospitalizations have increased 70 % over the past two weeks . 
" What is stretched most thin within both public and private hospitals across Los Angeles County is the availability of staff , " Ghaly said . 
The county will be able to find flex space within hospitals , using pre - and post operative space , unused wings , or the emergency department to hold patients , but finding trained staff will be more difficult . 
Los Angeles County residents should be prepared to potentially have nonessential surgeries or procedures canceled so that hospitals can make room for additional patients , Ghaly advised . 
" I cannot stress enough how concerning this is , as we know these numbers represent actions that were taken several weeks ago , " said Health Officer Dr . Muntu Davis . 
" Simply put , we need to turn this around immediately , but it will not be easy . " 
Despite his concern , Davis has yet to strengthen the health officer orders for the county of about 10 million . 
Noting that a state order is already in place limiting movement , he said his staff is still working to answer questions and give businesses more time to prepare for further restrictions . 
Note : These numbers were released by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
