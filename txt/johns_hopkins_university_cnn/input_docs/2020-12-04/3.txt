California has shattered its own Covid 19 records in Covid 19 cases , hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions . 
The state added 22,018 new Covid 19 cases Friday , a new record for California 's daily infection figure . 
The total number of confirmed cases is at least 1,286,557 since the start of the pandemic . 
Hospitalizations are also at the highest level seen yet , with more than 9,940 admitted patients . 
More than 2,200 of those are in intensive care units . 
ICU capacity is the single threshold that will trigger California ’s new stay at home order by region . 
If and when each of the five regions dip below 15 % ICU capacity , the stay home order will be enacted . 
None of the areas currently meets that threshold . 
The positivity rate in California stands at about 7.5 % with an average of about 210,000 tests being conducted each day . 
To note : These numbers were released by the California Department of Public Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
