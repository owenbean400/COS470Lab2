The US topped 5 million cases of coronavirus early Sunday â€” and as experts have highlighted before , the true number of infections could be many times higher . 
The number means the country holds about a quarter of global cases of the virus and also tops the list with the most reported deaths in the world . 
As of 9:00 a.m . ET , the US had at least 5,045,564 , according to the Johns Hopkins University tally . 
To put the number in perspective , that means the United States has had more Covid 19 cases than Ireland has people . 
The number of cases is also slightly higher than the entire population of Alabama . 
To put the speed in which the number is growing in perspective : It took the country 99 days to reach 1 million . 
43 days to hit 2 million . 
28 days for 3 million and 15 days to surpass 4 million on July 23 . 
The number has jumped to 5 million in 17 days . 
" This is such a sobering number , " said Dr . William Schaffner , a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University . 
The pandemic shows no sign of slowing , and deaths continue to climb , with more than 1,000 deaths reported each day over the past five days , according to data from Johns Hopkins University 's Covid Tracker .
