Cuba reported 93 new cases of Covid 19 on Monday , a record increase in new daily cases since the pandemic began , said the island ’s top epidemiologist Dr . Alfredo Durán Garcia . 
Cuba had claimed to have brought the spread of the virus under control in July and had begun easing some restrictions . 
But the spike in new cases put a halt to plans to reopen the economy of the communist run island . 
On Friday , Cuban officials suspended public transportation and access to the beach and ordered restaurants , bars and pools to shut down in Havana and a neighboring province , the two places that have seen the largest surge in new cases . 
Cuba has 2,953 confirmed Covid 19 cases and 88 coronavirus related deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
