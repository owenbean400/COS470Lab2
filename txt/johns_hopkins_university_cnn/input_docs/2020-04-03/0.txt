Only one month ago , on March 3 , there were about 92,000 cases of the novel coronavirus worldwide , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Of those , just over 80,000 were in mainland China , which was then slowly beginning to bring its local epidemic under control . 
Since then , the number of cases around the world has skyrocketed . 
One month later , on April 3 , there are more than 1 million infections globally . 
Nowhere is this more clear than in the United States . 
On March 3 , the country had recorded 118 cases , according to Johns Hopkins . 
It now has more than 245,000 . 
Just over a month ago , on March 1 , Kings County in Washington state announced the first death from the coronavirus in the United States . 
As of today , there are nearly 6,000 deaths in the US . 
Some US government estimates show a worst case scenario with a death toll for the country that runs into the hundreds of thousands . 
It still is not clear when we will see a peak of the pandemic . 
While some countries are seeing a drop in the rate of new daily infections , such as South Korea , others are experiencing a second wave . 
Speaking at a CNN town hall on Thursday , top US infectious diseases expert Dr . Anthony Fauci said that it could be some time before widespread lockdowns and stay at home orders have an effect on death tolls and infection counts .
