White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr . Anthony Fauci says reporting an additional 40,000 coronavirus cases each day is " unacceptable " -- and that rate of infection needs to come down before winter . 
Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , noted that some parts of the United States are doing well because they are following simple public health measures -- and said other areas should use them as a models . 
" Universal wearing of masks , physical distancing , avoiding crowds , doing things outdoor more than indoors , if possible , and washing your hands . 
That sounds like it 's very simplistic , but we know when we do that consistently , we prevent surges , and we turn them around , " he said . 
At least 33,778 new Covid 19 cases have been reported in the US on Tuesday , as of 9 p.m . ET , according to Johns Hopkins University .
