Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will lift some restrictions on movement and service despite thousands of new cases of the coronavirus being reported in the country daily . 
Speaking in an Easter Sunday news conference , Sánchez warned the Spanish people against complacency as the rate of infections and deaths from coronavirus continues to slow . 
Sánchez said that the lifting of restrictions , some of which will begin on Monday , would be progressive and measured . 
Spain has been one of the countries most heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic , with at least 166,831 infections and 17,209 fatalities as of Sunday , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Markers would be established to measure the infection rate and the capacity of Spain ’s health system , and those markers will determine which restrictions to lift . 
Above all , he said , the progress in combating the virus would not be put at risk . 
Sanchez said he took responsibility for insufficient supplies of protective equipment such as masks -- but the whole world had been unprepared . 
" Spain has begun to guarantee systematic provision of these materials , " and was taking " indescribable " steps to protect health care personnel . 
In the face of growing criticism from other parties of the government ’s handling of the virus , Sánchez also called for a united political response -- in Spain and in Europe . 
He proposed " a great bargain " between political parties in Spain to begin the recovery -- a display of unity to match that of the Spanish people .
