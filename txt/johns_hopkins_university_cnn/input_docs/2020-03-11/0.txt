Dr . Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University 's Center for Health Security , said he does not worry much about the possibility of getting coronavirus through handling money . 
" So this is a respiratory virus , so it spreads through coughs and sneezes and the droplets that go out of your body . 
They go about six feet and fall to the ground . 
It can land on surfaces , it can remain viable on the surfaces , but that 's not the main way that this is transmitting , " he explained . 
" I do not really , myself , worry about money or coins as a major way that this is transmitting , " he added . 
He urged people to wash their hands frequently , including after handling money , but reiterated " it 's not the main way " the virus spreads .
