As the United States approaches 200,000 coronavirus deaths , Dr . Tom Frieden , a former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director , said Wednesday that the number of reported deaths are a " reflection of a failing national response . " 
The former CDC director said he 's concerned that Americans will get " hardened " to the number of coronavirus deaths . 
As of Wednesday afternoon , the US has reported at least 196,465 coronavirus deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
According to Johns Hopkins , 1,293 deaths were reported Tuesday , which is the highest one day total since Aug . 19 . 
" If you look at Germany , one fifth are death rate , " Frieden said . 
" If you look at South Korea , 80 times fewer deaths than we 've had . 
These are lives that have been lost and jobs that have been lost because we have not had an organized , consistent , coherent federal response . "
