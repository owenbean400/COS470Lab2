New York City schools will remain open Monday , as the city ’s seven day test positivity rate continues to remain under 3 % . 
The 7 day average test positivity rate is 2.57 % , Bill Neidhardt , a spokesperson for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , said in a statement Sunday morning . 
More context : If the test positivity rate reached or exceeded 3 % , city schools could be closed and students would move to all - remote learning , the mayor has previously said . 
" Today , schools currently remain open , based on today ’s 7 day test positivity rate . 
Again , we expect the daily test positivity to backfill and increase as more tests results are entered into the system , but do not expect that increase to push today ’s 7 day average to 3 % , " Neidhardt said in an email . 
The mayor shared his gratitude on Twitter , saying in part , " Thankfully , schools will remain open on Monday , but we have to keep fighting back with everything we ’ve got . " 
In addition to the test positivity rate , at least 937 positive cases of Covid 19 have been reported Sunday and 117 people have been admitted to hospitals across the city , the email said . 
Remember : These numbers were released by the city ’s health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN ’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
