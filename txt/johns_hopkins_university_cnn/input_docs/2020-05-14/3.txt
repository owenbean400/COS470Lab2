Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Thursday that nearly 600,000 people in the country have lost their jobs as a result of the financial impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic , a number he called " shocking , although not unanticipated . " 
Morrison said that although the rate of infections is decreasing in Australia , the country should prepare for further economic hardship . 
Nearly 7,000 people in Australia have been infected by the virus , killing 98 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Last week , Morrison announced a three step plan to reopen the country if infections continue to trend downward .
