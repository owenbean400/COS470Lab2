Thirteen workers in an Italian retirement home have taken an unusual decision and decided to self quarantine with the 60 elderly people they assist . 
The number of coronavirus cases in Italy has reached 86,498 , according to a tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University . 
That puts the European country ahead of China , where 81,946 infections have been confirmed . 
" We decided to self isolate ourselves because the Covid 19 situation here in Italy was getting worse , " Ermanno Struzzeri , Vice President of the Onlus foundation San Riccardo Pampuri which runs the senior citizen care service on the outskirts of Milan told CNN . 
" None of our guests are positive , thankfully . " 
" Our guests are very calm , they realize the situation , they appreciate what we have decided to do , " Struzzeri said . 
The workers started their quarantine on March 19 , but told CNN they do not know how long it will last . 
" Families have not been able to come to the home for a while so little has changed for them , " Struzzeri explained . 
" We have a great relationship with our guests but in this situation there is more work , our work has become constant , but for them little has changed , " Struzzeri said .
