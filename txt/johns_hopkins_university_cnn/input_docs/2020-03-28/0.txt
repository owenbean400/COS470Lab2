Across the United States , prized chickens are laying life saving eggs at secret farms . 
Few people know where the chickens are kept -- their locations are undisclosed as a matter of national security .

With each egg producing one vaccine , that means the US might have used 140 million eggs this flu season alone . 
To prepare for annual flu seasons , as well as possible pandemics , the US government has invested tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 15 years to ensure there are enough eggs for vaccines . 
But now the world faces a new crisis : the novel coronavirus , which has infected more than 423,000 people globally and killed more than 19,000 since the virus emerged last December , according to Johns Hopkins University .

As scientists race to find a cure , the huge US stockpile of eggs wo not be of any help .
