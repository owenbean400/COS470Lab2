London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the United Kingdom is still some way off being able to ease the restrictions introduced to stop the spread of coronavirus . 
Khan said there is still spare capacity in the city â€™s intensive care units , but added that " too many people are losing their lives . " 
Junior health minister agrees : Edward Argar told BBC Radio that the restrictions will be reviewed " when the scientific advice is such that we appear to have gone over the peak and when it is safe to do so . " 
He also urged people to stay home over the Easter weekend . 
The lockdown restrictions were introduced by the UK government nearly three weeks ago . They were initially due to be reviewed on Monday . 
There are at least 55,949 confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK , including 6,171 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
