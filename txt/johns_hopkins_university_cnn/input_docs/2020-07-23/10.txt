South Africa has crossed the threshold of 400,000 confirmed Covid 19 cases . 
The country also has 6,000 confirmed Covid 19 deaths , President Cyril Ramaphosa said Thursday evening in a televised address to the nation . 
The country ’s 408,052 confirmed cases is the fifth highest globally , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University . 
During the address , Ramaphosa also announced that all public schools will close for the next four weeks as the country experiences a peak in infection rates , extending the current academic year beyond 2020 . 
Schools were previously closed during the country ’s initial lockdown . 
Ramaphosa announced that certain grades will return sooner than others . 
" It is important that schools do not become sites of transmission as our infections are rising fast , " Ramaphosa said . 
Ramaphosa said his government would be focused on investigating and punishing corruption in the country ’s Covid 10 response as several scandals of alleged procurement fraud in government and price gouging by companies have surfaced in recent weeks . 
" The consequences for those who break the law or bypass regulations must be severe , " Ramaphosa said . 
" The people of South Africa require nothing less than full accountability from those who have been elected and appointed to serve them . "
