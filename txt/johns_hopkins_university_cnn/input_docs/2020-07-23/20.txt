The President of Bolivia 's Supreme Electoral Court , Salvador Romero , announced on Thursday that the new date for the country 's presidential election will be moved to October 18 with a possible second round on November 29 , so that proper coronavirus safety measures can be implemented . 
Bolivia 's National Scientific Committee had sent a letter to Romero on Monday , recommending not to carry out the elections in September due to the high number of coronavirus infections . 
The election was scheduled to take place on September 6 , after being delayed again from its initial date in May . 
The country 's former long term leader Evo Morales , who resigned after the 2019 election over allegations of ballot fraud , quickly criticized the announcement . 
" The postponement of the election date will only cause more suffering to the Bolivian people because it prolongs the agony of the government in a sea of incapacities and ambitions that prevented them , in eight months , from taking measures to manage the current human and economic catastrophe , " Morales , who is currently in Argentina , said in a series of tweets . 
Morales also accused the interim government of trying to " gain more time " ahead of the election . 
Interim President Jeanine Áñez , who has vowed to hold new elections soon , is running against the candidate of the Movement for Socialism party , Luis Arce , backed by Morales . 
Also running are two former presidents , Jorge Quiroga , and Carlos Mesa . 
Why this matters : Bolivia is one of the hardest hit countries by the virus in Latin America . 
Infections have continued to rise rapidly in recent weeks . 
The country has so far reported more than 64,100 coronavirus cases and over 2,300 deaths , according to the latest numbers by Johns Hopkins University .
