New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy announced a $ 6 million lease emergency assistance grant program to assist small businesses with up to $ 10,000 in direct help to pay their rents . 
The grants , a New Jersey Redevelopment Authority ( NJRA ) initiative , will help small businesses in 64 communities covered by the authority . 
The grants will be paid for through federal CARES act funding , Murphy said . 
" We cannot get to where we need to be and where we know we will be without the women and men who own and operate the small businesses that make a municipality a community and turn a street into a gathering place for that community , " he added . 
Speaking at the news conference , Leslie Anderson , president and CEO of the NJRA , emphasized that this is a grant and not a loan , meaning businesses are not obligated to pay it back . 
Anderson also said that businesses cannot exceed 5,000 square feet in order to be eligible for the grant , a requirement the authority is enforcing in order to ensure only small businesses benefit from the grant . 
Murphy also reported during the news conference that over the last four months , 1.4 million New Jersey residents have filed claims for unemployment , " including 26,000 over the prior week . " 
This is the second straight week the state has seen a " significant decline " in unemployment filings , said Murphy . 
The latest numbers : There are 344 new Covid 19 cases and 23 deaths in the state , said Murphy . 
The positivity rate is 2.88 % . 
Note : These numbers were released by the county public health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
