India reported 83,337 new Covid 19 cases on Thursday , the highest daily increase announced by the country â€™s Health Ministry . 
Johns Hopkins University previously reported that India recorded 85,687 new cases on August 27 . 
The discrepancy between the figures is unclear . 
The Indian government maintains that its case numbers for August 27 were 77,266 and this is the first time it has recorded a 24 hour total greater than 80,000 . 
The Indian Health Ministry tweeted Thursday that it saw " an unprecedented surge in testing , " adding that more than 1,170,000 tests had been done in the past 24 hours . 
The total number of cases identified in India stands at 3,853,406 , including at least 67,376 deaths . 
Only the United States and Brazil have recorded more cases and deaths than India . 
Recovered patients : Nearly 77 % of the confirmed cases have recovered as the Health Ministry reported 2,970,492 recoveries . 
In India , not all patients require a test to be considered recovered . 
Patients with mild and moderate symptoms are considered no longer active after 10 days of symptom onset if they meet certain conditions , and a test to confirm that they no longer have the virus is not required . 
However , severe cases can only be discharged after one negative coronavirus test . 
Surging cases : In recent days , Delhi and Maharashtra state have seen case numbers increase significantly . 
According to the respective local health authorities , Maharashtra recorded more than 15,765 new cases on Wednesday , and the union territory of Delhi , which includes the national capital region of New Delhi , recorded 2,509 new cases .
