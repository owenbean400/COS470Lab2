Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said Friday he plans to reopen California in a methodical way , avoiding " fits and starts , " as the state enters the fall and winter seasons . 
" We are now reopening . 
We 're doing it much more methodically , and we 're doing it much more stubbornly , but in a way that I believe will ultimately aid our economic recovery , " Newsom said in an interview with the Milken Institute , a nonpartisan think tank founded by ex banker Michael Milken . 
Newsom said he believes California â€™s economy will benefit from not reopening in " fits and starts " as transmission rates rise over winter . 
He noted that as the state slowly modified its original stay at home order , many Californians viewed it as a green light to revert to pre pandemic lifestyles . 
" As a consequence , we started seeing mixing , " Newsom said . 
" We started seeing behavior that actually led to -- not a second wave , but a continuation of the first wave that we were able to temper . " 
The governor has implemented a tiered reopening system for California , allowing counties to reopen in phases determined by their level of coronavirus spread . 
The state had reported 869,766 coronavirus cases and 16,855 deaths as of Friday , according to Johns Hopkins University .
