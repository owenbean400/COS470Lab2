Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott is waiving regulations on physicians in training ( PIT ) permit holders to increase health care capacity to fight coronavirus in the state . 
With restrictions waived , PIT permit holders will be able to work at any Texas hospital or facility associated with the Graduate Medical Education ( GME ) training program . 
They will also be able to practice in areas outside their GME training program with physician oversight . 
For example , under these temporary waivers , residents in a surgical residency program can assist in an Emergency Department if a surge of patients is experienced . 
These waivers will increase the availability of medically trained individuals to help assist the coronavirus response . 
Texas has 12,398 confirmed coronavirus cases and 248 deaths , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University .
