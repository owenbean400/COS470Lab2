Illinois Governor J.B . Pritzker and his staff tested negative for Covid 19 , after being exposed to someone who tested positive in a meeting on Monday , according to a statement released by the governor 's office on Saturday . 
The statement says , per the CDC , that the group will not be required to quarantine for 14 days , since they are not considered " close contacts because they met with the individual prior to 48 hours before symptom onset . " 
This was the second time the group tested negative , after undergoing a test on Wednesday . 
The Illinois Department of Public Health ( IDPH ) reported 12,438 new confirmed and probable cases of coronavirus and 76 deaths on Saturday , making this third consecutive day of record high coronavirus case numbers and the second day that Illinois has reported over 10,000 daily coronavirus cases . 
Illinois underwent " resurgence mitigations " earlier this week , after test positivity rates soared in all regions of the state . 
All indoor restaurant and bar service has been banned , and all meetings , gatherings or social events are limited to 25 % capacity or a total of 25 guests , whichever is fewer . 
These numbers were released by the Illinois public health agency , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project CNN is tracking cases of Covid 19 across the US here :
