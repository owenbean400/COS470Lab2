This week , as voters cast ballots and waited to see who would clinch the White House , the Covid 19 largely fell out of view . 
But the coronavirus continued to spread , in some places at a higher rate than ever before . 
The US broke one record after another . 
On Wednesday , the US recorded more than 100,000 new cases in a single day for the first time , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
The country shattered that record a day later , recording 121,888 new Covid 19 cases on Thursday . 
On Friday , the US broke the record yet again , reporting more than 126,000 new cases . 
The records set this week are a stark reminder of the fall surge going on throughout the country , which experts warn will be the worst yet . 
On each of four days in a row this week -- Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday and Friday -- more than 1,000 people died nationwide . 
Among them was a Missouri election judge supervisor who worked at a polling site on Election Day after testing positive , and ignored instructions to quarantine for 14 days . 
Here 's what happened this week in America 's fight against Covid 19 .
