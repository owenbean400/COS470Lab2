New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was asked a slightly more unusual question about the nationwide lockdown at a news conference today . 
The " bubble " refers to the idea that New Zealanders should stay within their own bubbles , composed of people in their household -- and not go out or enter neighbors ' and friends ' bubbles during the lockdown . 
" But as you can imagine , at this time , of course they 're going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies . 
So I say to the children of New Zealand , if the Easter Bunny does not make it to your household , we have to understand that it 's a bit difficult at the moment perhaps for the Bunny to get everywhere . " 
Ardern suggested that if the Easter Bunny ca not make it to children 's homes this year , they could instead draw Easter eggs and tape them to the front windows of their homes , so neighborhood children can have their own social distancing Easter egg hunt . 
New Zealand has been under lockdown since March 25 . 
The country has reported 1,106 coronavirus cases , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
