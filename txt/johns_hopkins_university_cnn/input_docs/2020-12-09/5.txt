Alabama 's Health Officer Scott Harris said the state is " in some pretty dark days " with the surge in Covid 19 cases . 
Harris said there is optimism with the rollout of the vaccine which Alabama is expecting to receive its first doses by early next week . 
The state is expected to receive approximately 41,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the first shipment , which Harris cautions will not be enough for the first priority group .
