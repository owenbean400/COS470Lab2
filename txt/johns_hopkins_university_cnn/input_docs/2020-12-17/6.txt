As the US authorizes Covid 19 vaccines for emergency use , the task at hand is to encourage people that getting vaccinated against Covid 19 " is something you want to do for yourself , for your family , for the future of our nation , " Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , said Thursday . 
There has been so much misinformation circulating about vaccines that even health care workers are hesitant to get vaccinated , Collins told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . 
Collins warned that if the US does not reach 70 to 80 % immunization , " we could lose even more lives and that would be the worst possible kind of tragedy . " 
He urged Americans to take the raging coronavirus pandemic seriously . 
" Let me plead with Americans , " Collins said , as the number of Covid 19 deaths topped 4,000 on Wednesday and hospitalizations and case numbers continued shattering records . 
" Whatever you have come to , as far as the conclusion about your own ability to turn this around , set it aside , " he urged , " and let me talk to you for a minute here . " 
" We know that these masks that we are all being asked to wear , they 're not political statements , they are life saving medical devices , " Collins said . 
" We have another couple of dark months ahead of us , " Collins said . 
" If we do not do something at this point to try to stop this dreadful upward curve of hospitalizations and cases and deaths . 
More than 310,000 Americans have died of Covid 19 and more than 17.1 million have been infected , according to Johns Hopkins University .
