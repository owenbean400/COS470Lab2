Singapore recorded 528 new coronavirus cases as of noon local time today , according to the country 's Ministry of Health . 
That brings the total to 15,641 cases in the Southeast Asian city state , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Among today 's new cases , the vast majority are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories , while six are Singaporean citizens or permanent residents . 
The country 's cases spiked dramatically at the start of April , and authorities traced the increase to clusters of cases in the dormitories . 
About 200,000 migrant workers live in 43 dormitories , where cramped conditions and shared facilities make it easy for a highly infectious virus to spread . 
The dormitories are now all under lockdown , with nobody in or out . 
Authorities have taken residents showing symptoms to quarantine , stepped up testing , and are monitoring residents still inside the dorms .
