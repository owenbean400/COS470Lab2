The UK government retroactively revised its death toll on Wednesday , increasing the figure to reflect a new counting method . 
Public Health England announced on Tuesday it would begin to report deaths in all settings -- meaning in hospitals , care homes and the wider community -- in its daily figures . 
The death toll in the country now stands at 26,166 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Previously the UK only reported hospital deaths . 
" We must not gamble away the sacrifices and the progress that we have made . 
We must continue to follow the scientific evidence , and we must continue to take the right decisions at the right moment in time , " Raab said . 
" We are working on all of the potential options for a second phase , there is light at the end of the tunnel , whether you â€™re an NHS worker on the front line , working tirelessly shift after shift , or a parent at home with young children . "
