The UK might need to reduce the number of jurors needed for court cases so trials can resume with appropriate social distancing , said Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett . 
" It is going to be necessary to look at more radical measures , " he told the BBC , referring to the possibility that social distancing will last for some time . 
All new jury trials were suspended last month in response to the coronavirus outbreak . 
Some existing cases that do not require a jury have been able to continue through video and phone conferencing . 
The UK has recorded at least 166,441 cases of the coronavirus and 26,166 deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
