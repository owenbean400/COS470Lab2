The only way to combat coronavirus is to bring down new infections and conduct contact tracing , Germany 's four top medical research societies said in a rare joint statement . 
Trying to achieve " herd immunity " is bound to fail , said the statement by the Leibniz Association , Helmholtz Association , the Fraunhofer Society , and the Max Planck Society . 
The statement said scientists from all four societies pooled their analysis of data and came up with a common recommendation . 
The researchers say a two pronged approach is the most effective : " In the first phase , new infections are reduced until effective contact tracing becomes possible . 
In the second phase , there can be an adaptive strategy based on low numbers of infections . " 
For Germany , the researchers warn that while the reproduction of the coronavirus has been slowed down , " the situation is not stable , even a small increase in the reproduction number would lead us back into a phase of exponential growth . " 
The numbers : Germany has reported more than 163,000 coronavirus cases and at least 6,600 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
