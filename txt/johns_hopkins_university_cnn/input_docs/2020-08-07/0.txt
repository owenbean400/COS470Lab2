Researchers behind an influential model at the University of Washington are now projecting that the US death toll could reach nearly 300,000 by December 1 -- but that can be changed if consistent mask wearing occurs . 
" America ’s Covid 19 death toll is expected to reach nearly 300,000 by December 1 ; however , consistent mask wearing beginning today could save about 70,000 lives , according to new data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) at the University of Washington ’s School of Medicine , " a statement said . 
According to Johns Hopkins University , nearly 160,000 people have died in the United States since the pandemic began . 
" The US forecast totals 295,011 deaths by December , " the IHME statement said . 
The model does not have to come true , said IHME director Dr . Christopher Murray : " The public ’s behavior had a direct correlation to the transmission of the virus and , in turn , the numbers of deaths . " 
In its previous forecast , published July 7 , IHME projected there would be 230,822 US deaths from Covid 19 by November . 
" Since July 15 , several states have added mask mandates . 
IHME ’s statistical analysis suggests that mandates with no penalties increase mask wearing by 8 percentage points . 
But mandates with penalties increase mask wearing by 15 percentage points , " the statement said . 
This new model assumes that 50 % of school districts will have online school in the fall . 
When schools make their final decisions , this will impact the forecast and IHME " will incorporate them into our future revisions of forecasts . "
