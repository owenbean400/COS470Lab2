Mike De Wine announced 87 Covid 19 deaths reported in the last 24 hours , the highest number of deaths reported in one day since early May . He clarified that while the deaths were reported in the last 24 hours , it does not mean the deaths occurred in that time frame .

There have been at least 4,506 total deaths reported in the state . 
The governor said that in a recent conversation with university presidents in Ohio about the return to campus , many said that the major issue they are facing is large student gatherings without masks . 
De Wine encouraged students to wear their masks in any social situation and to remain outdoors whenever possible . 
On the economy : De Wine also announced the launch of a new work program meant to help those lost their jobs during the pandemic find new positions .
