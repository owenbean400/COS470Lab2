The United States reported 47,913 new cases of Covid 19 and 1,029 new related deaths on Saturday , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
This brings the national total up to 5,361,165 cases and 169,481 deaths . 
The totals include cases from all 50 states , the District of Columbia and other US territories , as well as repatriated cases . 
Dr . Robert Redfield , Director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , warned this week that if Americans fail to follow coronavirus prevention guidelines such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds , we could be in store for " the worst fall , from a public health perspective , we 've ever had . " 
The grim figures come as schools and universities across the country are reopening , yet experts like US â€™s top infectious diseases expert , Dr . Anthony Fauci , have warned against a rushed reopening as cases soar in the country . 
" To think that you can ignore the biologic and get the economy back , it 's not gonna happen , " Fauci told actor Matthew Mc Conaughey in an interview on Instagram on Thursday . 
" It 's just not gonna happen . 
You gotta do both . 
You gotta get control of the biologic as you carefully open the country . "
