According to data from Johns Hopkins University , from Sept . 30 through Oct . 10 , Montana reported 5,046 coronavirus cases . 
The state recorded its first coronavirus case on March 13 and on Aug . 10 reported having 5,017 cases across the state . 
It took 150 days , or four months and 28 days , for the state to reach more than 5,000 coronavirus cases at the start of the pandemic .
