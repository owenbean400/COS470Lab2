For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit Cuba , Havana residents will be subjected to a nightly curfew and not be allowed to travel to other provinces in the country , Havana Governor Reinaldo Garcia Zapata announced Thursday . 
Cuba â€™s ruling Communist Party has struggled to control a second wave of Covid 19 in Havana , just weeks after declaring the country was closing in on the tail end of the pandemic . 
The curfew from 7 p.m . until 5 a.m . will begin on September 1 and last for at least 15 days , Zapata said . 
Zapata said penalties for people not wearing a mask would be increased and the consumption of alcohol in public would be banned . 
Cuba , with a population of 11 million , has so far registered 3,806 coronavirus cases and 92 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University data .
