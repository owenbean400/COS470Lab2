Peru 's high coronavirus death rate -- the second highest in the world according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- is due to the country 's transparency with the statistics , a senior Peruvian official said . 
Peru has recorded 88 deaths per 100,000 citizens , according to the university 's Coronavirus Resource Center , marginally ahead of Belgium and behind only the microstate of San Marino in northern Italy . 
Martos said a study is underway into people who had died and been diagnosed with coronavirus " even when they may have died from other causes or other diseases . " 
As of Wednesday , the Peruvian Ministry of Health had confirmed a total of 613,378 coronavirus cases , including 28,124 deaths .
