Drivers jammed into Michigan 's capital and surrounded the state Capitol in a protest against Michigan Gov . 
Gretchen Whitmer 's stay at home order that featured neither face masks nor social distancing , but rather the honking of horns that could be heard inside . 
The collision between a public health battle and a political one , which played out for more than five hours on Wednesday , underscores the boiling tensions of a restless nation struggling with the wisdom of reopening the economy before the deadly pandemic subsides . 
Whitmer could hardly ignore the scene , considering the honking horns , raucous jeers and blaring music became background noise for her video conference call with health care workers . 
" Right outside my office right now , people have come to town who are not wearing masks , they are not observing the six foot distance , " Whitmer said . 
" Give me some advice . 
How can I magnify what you 're seeing and what you 're experiencing ? " 
CNN 's Jeff Zeleny reported on the gathering in Michigan , which he called a " protest by parade . " 
Zeleny acknowledged the economic pain Michigan is feeling with one quarter of the state 's eligible workforce seeking some type of unemployment help . 
Yet in the end , the protest " seemed oddly discordant on a day that the state 's death toll hovered around 2,000 people , " he said . 
Michigan currently has 29,263 coronavirus cases and 2,093 deaths , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University .
