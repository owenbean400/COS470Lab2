There are public health measures officials in Florida can implement to reduce risk of transmission of Covid 19 and avoid a shutdown , said Dr . Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute . 
A " shutdown is the most extreme version of what you need to do , " Jha said Friday on CNN ’s New Day . 
" What many of us in the public health community have been advocating is that let 's do everything to prevent the shutdown . " 
A mask mandate , no large gatherings , and ramping up testing , tracing and isolation , are efforts that can curtail the virus , according to Jha .
