Dr . Sanjay Gupta implored people to continue wearing masks because Covid 19 can be spread by asymptomatic people " even if they 're not showing symptoms . " 
The virus is " still very contagious , " Gupta said Thursday evening during CNN 's global coronavirus town hall . 
To put the number of deaths in perspective , Gupta said " essentially two jumbo jets of people every 24 hours " die from the virus . 
Some context on infections : Just as much of the US was improving , 10 states are seeing their highest seven day average of new coronavirus cases per day since the pandemic started months ago , according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University . 
The data includes new cases reported by Johns Hopkins through Tuesday . 
The states seeing record high averages are Alabama , Arizona , California , Florida , Nevada , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina and Texas . 
Texas also reported a record high number of daily Covid 19 hospitalizations on Monday , with 2,326 . 
Los Angeles County , which accounts for almost half of California 's cases , on Wednesday reported another single day high of new cases , though officials said the spike was due to lagging test reports .
