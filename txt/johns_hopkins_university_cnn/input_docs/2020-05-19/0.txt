El Salvador 's Supreme Court on Monday suspended the anti coronavirus state of emergency declared by President Nayib Bukele , saying the decree 's extension was unlawful . 
Bukele signed a presidential decree extending anti coronavirus measures on Saturday , a day before the restrictions were set to expire , without seeking Congress approval . 
Critics and lawmakers accused the President of overstepping his authority . 
On Monday , the Supreme Court ruled that the power to extend anti coronavirus measures resides with the Congress , and ordered the presidential decree to be suspended with immediate effect . 
The Supreme Court urged the President and Congress to " act together " in order to present a new emergency decree as soon as possible , according to the text of the resolution . 
Bukele reacted to the resolution in a tweet Monday , accusing the court of breaking constitutional order . 
El Salvador first implemented anti coronavirus measures on March 14 , one of the first countries in Central America to impose a lockdown . 
The country has confirmed 1,413 cases and 30 deaths from the virus , according to Johns Hopkins University .
