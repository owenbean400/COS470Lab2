Millions of people in India and Bangladesh are in the path of a super cyclone that is due to make landfall in less than 36 hours , bringing damaging winds and heavy rain to a region already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic . 
Super Cyclone Amphan became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal on Monday night , after intensifying with sustained wind speeds of up to 270 kph ( 165 mph ) , according to data from the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center . 
Double disaster : The storm comes as both India and Bangladesh struggle to bring local coronavirus outbreaks under control . 
India passed more than 100,000 confirmed infections on Monday , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
Meanwhile , Bangladesh 's infection count is rapidly rising -- the country has recorded 23,870 confirmed infections , according to Johns Hopkins . 
Complicated challenge : Tackling both disasters at once will be challenging for the two governments , especially if they attempt to maintain social distancing in packed evacuation centers and emergency shelters . 
Pradhan said that in the state of West Bengal there is normally room in cyclone shelters for 500,000 people but because of social distancing rules due to the epidemic , that number had been reduced to just 200,000 . 
He added that the areas under threat from the cyclone were comparatively less developed , with many villagers in temporary homes with thatched or tin roofs . 
" That is going to be in the line of fire , " he said . 
Refugee risks : Cyclone Amphan could also bring heavy rains to the world 's largest refugee camp in Cox 's Bazar in Bangladesh , where almost 1 million Rohingya refugees live after fleeing violence in Myanmar 's Rakhine state . 
The first known Covid 19 cases were confirmed in the camp last week and with the storm now imminent , the two disasters could make for a devastating combination .
