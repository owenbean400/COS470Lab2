Coronavirus deaths should start dropping around parts of the United States by next week , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr . Robert Redfield said Thursday , because people are doing more to control the virus by social distancing , staying out of crowds , wearing masks and washing hands . 
But Redfield said not every region is improving . 
" There ’s a warning sign … Middle America right now is getting stuck , " he said . 
" We do not need to have a third wave in the heartland . " 
States have to stick with the interventions meant to slow the spread of the virus , Redfield said . 
According to Johns Hopkins University , more than 5.5 million people in the US have been diagnosed with coronavirus and more than 174,000 have died , although Redfield has said testing has likely caught only about one in 10 cases .
