When Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo of New York held up a letter and N 95 mask sent to him by a retired Kansas farmer , he called it humanity at its best . 
" If you could , would you please give this mask to a nurse or doctor in your state ? " read the March letter from Dennis Ruhnke . 
Now , Ruhnke has been given an honorary degree from his state . 
Kelly and Kansas State University President Richard Myers presented Ruhnke with a bachelor 's degree during a ceremony on Tuesday . 
Ruhnke was two credits shy of earning his degree in 1971 when his father died , according to Kelly 's post . 
He decided to leave school to look after his mother and the family farm . 
The N 95 mask was one of five left over from Ruhnke 's farming days , he said in the letter . 
He and his wife , who are both in their 70s , sent the unused mask to Cuomo amid a medical supply shortage . 
New York has been the hardest hit state during the coronavirus pandemic , with more than 321,000 reported cases and at least 25,124 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
