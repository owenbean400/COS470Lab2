On Sunday , two countries accounted for half of all new cases added worldwide , World Health Director Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Monday . 
Tedros did not name the countries , but according to a Johns Hopkins university tally of cases , the United States , India and Brazil accounted for more than 112,000 cases on Sunday . 
" Let me be blunt : Too many countries are headed in the wrong direction , " Tedros said . 
" The virus remains public enemy number one , " Tedros said . 
" But the actions of many governments and people do not reflect of this . 
" Here 's a look at the total number of confirmed cases by country : Tedros added that " mixed messages from leaders are undermining the most critical ingredients of any response : trust . " 
" If governments do not clearly communicate with their citizens and roll out a comprehensive strategy focused on suppressing transmission and saving lives . 
If populations do not follow the basic principles of physical distancing , hand washing , wearing masks , " Tedros warned , " there is only one way this is going to go . 
It 's going to get worse and worse and worse . " 
" But , it does not have to be this way , " he said . 
" It 's never too late to bring the virus under control , even if there has been explosive transmission , " Tedros said . 
" WHO is committed to working with all countries . "
