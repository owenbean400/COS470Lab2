Oregon Gov . 
Kate Brown announced new requirements for face coverings and limits on social gatherings in a statement . 
Starting on July 15 , Oregon â€™s face covering requirement will be expanded to apply to " outdoor public spaces when six feet of distance cannot be maintained , " according to the statement . 
In addition , the new restrictions prohibit indoor gatherings of more than 10 people , the statement added . 
The move comes in response to " the alarming rise in Covid 19 " cases in the state . 
" We need to do absolutely everything we can to reduce transmission in ways that do not require us to close down businesses again , " Brown said in the statement . 
" Either people will adhere to this requirement and be a positive force for stopping Covid 19 , or I will be forced to take more restrictive measures . " 
Although the state has seen a rise in cases , it has not been as steep or dramatic as states like Florida or Arizona . 
A CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University has Oregon showing a steady trend of new cases .
