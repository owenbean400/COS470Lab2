The latest forecast of an influential coronavirus model projects 394,693 total US coronavirus deaths by February 1 . 
That â€™s about 181,000 additional lives lost beyond the current US death toll of 213,860 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
The model , from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine , projects that daily deaths in the US will peak at about 2,300 in mid January . 
For comparison , Friday 's US death toll was 990 , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
The new projections are based off of current conditions . 
If US social distancing mandates are eased , the model projects 502,852 coronavirus related deaths by February 1 . 
Masks make a difference . 
If 95 % of people in the US wore masks , the model projects that 79,000 fewer lives would be lost by February 1 , and daily deaths would peak at less than 1,400 . 
Greater context : Globally , the model predicts that 2,488,346 people will die from coronavirus by February 1 . 
The model shows that if 95 % of people around the world wore masks , more than three quarters of a million lives would be saved by that date .
