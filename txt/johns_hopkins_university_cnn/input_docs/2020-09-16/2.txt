The final Covid 19 case count on Tuesday for the US has been corrected by Johns Hopkins University to 39,617 cases and 1,293 deaths . 
Earlier numbers should not be used . 
With this fix , Tuesday ’s death count is still the highest one day total since Aug . 19 . 
Yesterday ’s new case numbers are now in line with recent averages . 
The US is currently averaging 38,037 new Covid 19 cases a day , which is up 5 % from the previous week . 
The university explained that the discrepancy was the result of both a data dump in Alabama ’s numbers and a misreading on its part , which led to a double count on a single day . 
States often have data dumps when they change how to report cases/deaths , and the university normally redistributes those cases to the proper days . 
The data dump and the dashboard error have both been fixed , the university told CNN .
