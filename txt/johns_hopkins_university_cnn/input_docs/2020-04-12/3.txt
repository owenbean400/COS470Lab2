This Easter Sunday , the Rev . 
Tim Kesicki , the head of the Jesuit order in North America , will officiate a Mass around his family 's dining room table . 
The service will include just Kesicki , his sister and parents at their home in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . 
But it wo not necessarily be a quiet Mass . 
" During the homily , it is not uncommon for my mom to offer comments , " Kesicki said , laughing . 
" It 's very welcome , of course . " 
Kesicki , who lives in Washington , DC , has celebrated Mass with his family before , a perk of being an ordained Catholic priest . 
But for many Christians , Easter this year will be dramatically different : a home bound , shelter in place holy day . 
No Easter parades , no egg hunts at church , no church at all . 
As there 's been all Lent , there 's a solemness in the air . 
It does not escape many Christians that they 're celebrating Jesus ' resurrection at a time of rampant sickness and death . 
More than 1.7 million people around the world have been infected by the novel coronavirus , and over 100,000 have died , according Johns Hopkins University . 
The collateral damage can seem nearly as stunning . 
More than 16 million Americans were out of jobs in just the last three weeks . 
The pandemic has emptied St . Peter 's Square of pilgrims , silenced the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and shuttered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem , the site of the first Easter two millennia ago . Sanctuaries across the world , normally filled with Easter lilies and families wearing spring pastels and holiday hats , sit vacant this Sunday .
