California surpassed New York as the state with the most coronavirus cases in the US . 
However , while New York reached its coronavirus peak within a month , California saw a slow build up to the surge , according to Johns Hopkins University . 
As New York was one of the first states to be hit with the surge , it did not have much time to prepare , according to Dr . Mizuho Morrison , an emergency physician in Southern California . 
However , as New York went through its surge and eventually bent the curve , she says doctors in California were learning from their New York colleagues and putting plans in place to manage its surge . 
" In emergency medicine , we actually call this time to prepare the golden hour . 
So we had that luxury , " she said . 
However , Morrison says that she is dreading the upcoming flu season , which may complicate things , especially when states and schools start reopening and people go back to work . 
" We have rapid influenza testing , but rapid Covid testing is not so robust . 
We do not have enough of it . 
We really reserve it for those patients who ’re coming to the hospital . 
As flu season begins to hit , because the symptoms and presentation is so similar , it ’s going to be difficult for us to decipher , is this Covid or is this influenza ? " 
Morrison said .
