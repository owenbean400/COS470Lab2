The UK ’s coronavirus contact tracing app -- which will alert users if they have been near someone infected with the virus -- will start being used in a limited way this week , said the country ’s Transport Secretary Grant Shapps . 
" And the idea is that we will encourage as many people as possible to take this up as possible . 
" We need for this to work – 50 , 60 % of people to be using this app . " 
He said it would be the " best possible way " for people to help the UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) , adding that the data will be confidential . 
Other countries have already launched smartphone apps to help track the spread of the virus in the community . 
Shapps also indicated there ’ll be a push to get more people walking or riding to work when coronavirus restrictions start to ease so that public transport is not overcrowded . 
" [ There is ] a very popular scheme where you can buy a bike through your employer – effectively before tax – and pay it back , " he told Sky News . 
" We ’ve seen hundreds of percent increase [ in interest ] in that scheme . " 
The UK has now recorded 183,500 cases and 28,205 deaths from the coronavirus , according to figures from Johns Hopkins University .
