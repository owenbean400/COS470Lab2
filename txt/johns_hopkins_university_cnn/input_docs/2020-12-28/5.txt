New Jersey is expected to vaccinate approximately 31,000 long term care residents and staff by the end of this week , Gov . 
Phil Murphy said in a Monday news conference . 
The state started its long term care vaccination program this morning , with CVS planning to visit 85 long term care facilities and provide more than 27,600 vaccinations , Murphy said . 
Walgreens is expected to visit 15 different care sites and provide approximately 4,100 vaccinations , he continued . 
Murphy later clarified that the " mega sites " will be open only to those in the current phase of vaccine distribution . 
It is likely that these sites will mostly serve health care workers , he said . 
What the numbers look like : New Jersey reported 2,745 new Covid 19 cases and 21 additional deaths , with a positivity rate of 10.98 % . 
There are currently 3,684 people hospitalized with 715 patients in intensive care , Murphy said . 
As of today , 220,425 doses of vaccines have been delivered overall with 46,217 doses administered , according to Department of Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli . 
These numbers might change as they get updated reports from over the weekend , she said . 
Murphy also addressed an event of 200 people shut down over the weekend , saying that while he did not have all the details it sounded " incredibly irresponsible . " 
He said that it will likely be difficult for contact tracers to get in touch with everyone related to the event . 
Note : These numbers were released by the state of New Jersey , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project .
