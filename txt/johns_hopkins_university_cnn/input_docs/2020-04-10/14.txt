Infectious disease expert Dr . Anthony Fauci commended the steps Americans are taking to socially distance but warned that the country as a whole should not " be pulling back . " 
Dr . Deborah Birx , an HIV researcher and the White House coronavirus response coordinator , struck a similar tone . 
She commended the Washington and Baltimore areas for their adherence to social distancing guidelines , while cautioning that the US has " not reached the peak " of coronavirus infections . 
" I know last week , we asked a lot of people in the Washington and Baltimore area to consolidate , not go out frequently to grocery stores or pharmacies . 
You can see that 's having a huge impact , so it 's really about the encouraging signs that we see . 
But as encouraging as they are , we have not reached the peak , and so every day , we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that . 
So in the end , that will take us across the peak and down the other side , " Birx said . 
The US has more than 475,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 18,000 deaths , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University .
