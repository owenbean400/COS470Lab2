Hungary 's restrictions on movement have slowed the spread of coronavirus but the " real test " has yet to come , Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday in an interview with state broadcaster Kossuth Radio . 
According to the Hungarian Government website , " [ Orban ] said he regards the containment effort as successful in as much as that they have slowed down the spread of the epidemic , and as a result , they have gained time . 
However , ' the great trial , the real test is yet to come . ' " " In the context of the epidemic , Mr Orban also said he can see that there are countries which are " already heading towards the exit " ; however , in Hungary he ' cannot yet see the light at the end of the tunnel . ' " Orban said when infections peak in Hungary , the nation will need about 8,000 intensive care beds and ventilators , adding that in " peace time " Hungary has about 2,000 ventilators . 
The populist leader was last week given powers to rule by decree after a vote in Hungary 's Parliament , a move criticized by international human rights watchdogs . 
Hungary has 1,190 confirmed cases of coronavirus , including 77 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
