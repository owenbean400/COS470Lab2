There were more than 144,000 new cases of Covid 19 reported among children in the week ending Nov . 19 â€“ marking the highest weekly increase since the pandemic began , according to an update Monday from the American Academy of Pediatrics . 
Children now account for more than 11 % of all confirmed coronavirus cases in the US . 
There has been a 28 % increase in child Covid 19 cases over two weeks . 
The AAP said 144,145 new cases among children 17 and under were reported from Nov . 5 to 19 . 
The group , which represents pediatricians , says nearly 1.2 million children have been infected in the US as of Nov . 19 . 
According to Johns Hopkins University , more than 12.2 million Americans have been infected with the novel coronavirus . 
Severe illness and death from Covid 19 are still rare among children . 
As of Nov . 19 , children represented between 1.2 % and 3.1 % of total hospitalizations , depending on the state . 
Between 0.2 % and 5.6 % of all child Covid 19 cases resulted in hospitalizations in states that reported that information , and fewer than 0.14 % of all children with Covid 19 died . 
Seventeen states reported no child deaths . 
The count is not complete , because not all states report data the same way . 
These numbers come from 49 states , New York City , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and Guam . 
A smaller subset of states report information about hospitalizations and deaths by age . 
The AAP says there is an " urgent need " to collect more data on longer term impacts on children , including the ways in which the virus may hurt children physically and emotionally long term .
