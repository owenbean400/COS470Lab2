With states like Florida , Arizona and Texas in dire condition , the virus has also been spreading farther north in recent days , causing alarm among public health officials who fear states are not doing enough to avoid catastrophic outbreaks like those in the Sun Belt . 
The surge in the Midwest has been fuelled largely by a rise in cases among young adults , who have been visiting bars , restaurants and health clubs again . 
Florida reported 191 new deaths , another one day high for the state , while Arizona recorded 104 , and Arkansas had a single day record with 20 . 
There are approximately 4.3 million confirmed infections and about 150,000 Covid 19 deaths in the US , according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University . 
Republican governors in Tennessee , Mississippi , Missouri and South Carolina have all resisted calls to close bars and gyms , or issue statewide mask requirements , though local officials have imposed some of their own restrictions . 
In Mississippi , nine of the states biggest hospitals had no open intensive care beds as of Monday , and officials are considering opening pop up facilities to provide more space . 
More than 24 % of coronavirus tests have come back positive in Mississippi over the past week , the highest rate in the nation and triple the national average . 
Mississippi Republican governor Tate Reeves has gone so far as to argue that because mask wearing has become political , a statewide mandate could actually discourage people from covering their faces . 
Instead , he is requiring masks only in the most seriously stricken counties . 
In Missouri , larger cities are growing rattled by a spike in cases after the state fully reopened . 
The state reported another single day record increase in cases , with nearly 1,800 . 
St Louis is curtailing bar hours and reducing restaurant seating capacity starting Friday , and Kansas City may follow suit .
