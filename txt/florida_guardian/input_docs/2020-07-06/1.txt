The US senator Chuck Grassley will skip Donald Trump ’s presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in August due to coronavirus concerns , a spokesman for the senator has confirmed . 
Reuters has reported that the 86 year old Iowa Republican has attended each of his party ’s conventions since he was first elected to the Senate in 1980 . 
His decision not to travel to Florida for this year ’s event underscores broader concerns about holding mass gatherings as coronavirus cases there surge . 
" I ’m not going to go because of the virus situation , " Grassley told reporters on Monday , according to a report in the Des Moines Register . 
The bulk of the Republican convention was moved from North Carolina after the state ’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper would not commit to allowing a full convention because of pandemic concerns . 
Some 330 delegates will travel to Charlotte , North Carolina , from 22 to 24 August to nominate Trump as the Republican candidate to take on Democrat Joe Biden in the 3 November election . 
The more than 2,000 remaining delegates will perform a ceremonial vote between 24 and 27 August in Jacksonville , in Florida , to confirm the nomination , according to the Republican National Committee . 
The decision to relocate to Florida was made prior to the state ’s recent spike in cases , which have grown from 667 new cases on 1 June to more than 10,000 new cases on Monday . 
The state has seen more than 200,000 total infections and 3,730 deaths as of Monday .
