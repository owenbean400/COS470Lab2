Almost two months after reopening , Universal Orlando is laying off an undisclosed number of workers . 
Universal spokesman Tom Schroder said in an email on Monday that the Florida theme park resort was " reducing its workforce to reflect current priorities and needs . " 
Universal has put the construction of a new theme park , Epic Universe , on pause because of the pandemic . 
Comcast , Universal Orlando ’s owner , reported last week that the company ’s theme parks division shrank to $ 87m in revenue from $ 1.46bn a year ago . " We are prioritizing daily operations and shorter term projects and continuing our pause on longer term projects such as Epic Universe as we allow the tourism industry to recover , " Schroder said . 
Like theme park operators around the US , Universal Orlando closed its doors in mid March as Covid 19 started spreading in the country . 
It was the first of Orlando ’s major theme park operators to reopen when it welcomed back visitors in early June . 
Sea World reopened in late June , and Walt Disney World welcomed back visitors last month . 
All of the parks have new rules meant to limit the spread of the virus . 
Guests and workers must have their temperatures checked and wear masks . 
Attendance has been limited to allow for social distancing in the parks .
