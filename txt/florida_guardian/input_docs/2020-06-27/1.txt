Florida , Arizona and Nevada are amon five US states that have recorded daily highs for coronavirus infections on Saturday , highlighting the worsening spread of the virus in several southern and western states , which is prompting some of them to roll back their reopening plans , Reuters reports . 
Florida on Saturday morning reported 9,585 new infections in the last 24 hours , a record for a second day , while Arizona recorded 3,591 new cases , matching its prior record on 23 June . 
South Carolina and Georgia reported 1,604 and 1,990 new infections , respectively , also marking new daily highs . 
The governor of Texas , Greg Abbott , said on Saturday that he regrets having reopened the state ’s economy : " If I could go back and redo anything , it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars , now seeing in the aftermath of how quickly the coronavirus spread in the bar setting , " he said . 
Nevada disclosed 1,099 new cases , double its previous record high . 
The surge in cases has been most pronounced in a handful of southern and western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively , serving as a warning to the potentially illusory nature of any perceived progress in controlling the virus . 
On Friday , as the United States recorded its largest daily case count of the pandemic , Anthony Fauci , the nation ’s top infectious disease expert , said the government ’s current strategy for finding and isolating infected people was " not working , " partly due to significant asymptomatic spread .
