US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has attacked President Donald Trump ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Biden , 77 , spoke from his home city of Wilmington , Delaware ahead of a campaign trip by Trump , 74 , to the battleground state of Florida with just 11 days left in the campaign . 
While election day is scheduled for November 3 , more than 52 million Americans have already voted , a record setting pace that points to a record turnout , according to the University of Florida ’s Elections Project . 
Biden said : " He ’s quit on America . 
He just wants us to grow numb . " 
He said if he wins the election , he will ask Congress to pass comprehensive Covid 19 response legislation and send it to him to sign into law within his first 10 days in office . 
" I ’m not going to shut down the economy . 
I ’m not going to shut down the country . 
I ’m going to shut down the virus , " he said .
