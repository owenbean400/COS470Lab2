Although most of California is still in lockdown , officials are starting to see signs of hope as new cases and hospitalisations drop , the Los Angeles Times reports . 
America â€™s most populous state still has the most cases in the country , but when adjusting for population , other states such as Florida , Arizona , Georgia and Louisiana are doing worse . 
Over the last week , an average of 93,527 tests have been conducted each day , and the statewide positivity rate has decreased to 3.7 % . 
But the crisis is far from over . 
As of 11 September , 14,269 Covid 19 deaths had been recorded in California , and on Saturday morning , total confirmed infections stood at 755,705 . 
On Friday California reported its biggest jump in deaths in five days , and over the past week , the state has averaged 3,464 new cases and 89 new deaths per day . 
As seen in many other places , race disparities persist : Latinos in the state are now 3.4 times more likely to test positive than white people .
