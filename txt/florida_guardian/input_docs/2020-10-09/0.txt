US President Donald Trump said he could have become very ill and might not have recovered from Covid 19 without experimental drugs , a far worse outlook than what his doctors were telling the American people . 
" I was asking the doctors today ... and I said , How bad was I ? ’ They said : You could have been very bad . 
You were going into a very bad phase , ’ " Trump told Rush Limbaugh during his radio show . 
" It looked like it was going to be a big deal and you know what that means , right ? 
That means bad because I ’ve lost five people , " he added , referring to acquaintances who have died . 
Trump said that after contracting the virus , he was " not in the greatest of shape . " 
He added that " I might not have recovered at all " without treatment with experimental drugs . 
His comments on the seriousness of his coronavirus contrast with generally upbeat public statements about his condition that his doctors released after his diagnosis and while he was hospitalised . 
The White House said Trump ’s being admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week was precautionary and his symptoms were mild . 
Trump is expected to hold first rally since his diagnosis on Monday in Florida .
