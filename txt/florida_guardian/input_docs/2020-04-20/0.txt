If we have enough tests to go into phase 1 , why is the governor of Maryland having to get half a million tests from South Korea ? 
Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir is asked . 
He responds : " I do not know what the governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea but there ’s excess capacity every day . " 
Trump then attacked Hogan for securing tests , saying , " He could ’ve saved a lot of money ... 
He needed to get a little knowledge , that would ’ve been helpful . " 
Regarding testing facilities in his state , Hogan just told CNN " more than half [ of those listed by the federal government ] in Maryland were federal facilities that we have desperately been trying to get help from , or military facilities " . 
From my colleague Sam Levin : Earlier in the conference , vice president , Mike Pence , praised the testing efforts in Arizona , Florida , California , Michigan , and other states . 
He also claimed the US currently has " enough testing capacity " for every state to start phase one of the White House recommendations for re opening their economies . 
In fact , a number of governors have expressed concerns that the testing capacity is not yet adequate for reopening the country . 
Most prominently this week , Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland has said his state was dealing with a shortage and negotiated to get 500,000 tests from South Korea . . @ kaitlancollins : If we have enough tests now for everyone to go into phase one , why is the governor of Maryland having to get tests from South Korea ? 
HHS OFFICIAL GIROIR : " I do not know what the governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea but there 's excess capacity every day "
