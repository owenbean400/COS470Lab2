Los Angeles County recorded an " alarming " one day spike of nearly 3,000 new Covid 19 infections on Monday , taking its total to more than 100,000 cases , public health officials said , warning that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed . 
Los Angeles and neighboring counties have become a new epicenter in the pandemic as cases and hospitalisations have surged there despite California governor Gavin Newsom â€™s strict order last week requiring masks in nearly all public spaces . 
" The alarming increases in cases , positivity rates and hospitalisations signals that we , as a community , need to take immediate action to slow the spread of Covid 19 , " Barbara Ferrer , director of public health for Los Angeles County , said in a statement announcing the sharp upswing . 
" Otherwise , we are quickly moving toward overwhelming our healthcare system and seeing even more devastating illness and death , " Ferrer said . 
The county reported a single day record of 2,903 new cases . 
California , which on Sunday ordered bars in Los Angeles and six other counties to close , is among several US states including Florida , Texas and Arizona battling a new wave of infections as the nation emerges from weeks of clamp downs on residents and businesses .
