The governor of the US state of Florida , Ron De Santis , said tests administered in his state on Friday aiming to detect Covid 19 antibodies showed a 16.1 % positive rate . 
Having antibodies indicates that a person has had the virus at some point . 
" That is a significant jump from where we were about a month and a half ago , " De Santis said during a press conference on Saturday . 
" So there ’s a bigger pool of people who have the antibody , " he said . 
" If you do not have symptoms but you think [...] you have been exposed to the virus in the past , the antibody test is probably a better test than the diagnostic test . 
[...] If you have the antibodies , that ’s information that you can take with you , " De Santis added . 
De Santis also urged citizens who have recovered from the virus to consider donating blood for scientific trials involving convalescent plasma . 
Coronavirus cases in Florida have surged in recent weeks . 
On Saturday , Florida reported a total of 337,569 virus cases and 4,895 deaths . 
Florida made headlines with a record number of deaths among residents on Thursday , but both deaths and cases began to decline over the last two days . 
De Santis has resisted calls to impose statewide mandatory wearing of masks .
