US president Donald Trump is eager to get back on the campaign trail and said on Thursday he may have to stage rallies at outdoor sites until the coronavirus pandemic settles down enough for traditional events , Reuters reports . 
" We got to get back to the rallies , " Trump told reporters during a tour of a Ford auto plant in Ypsilanti , Michigan . 
" I think it â€™s going to be sooner rather than later . " 
With little more than five months left until the election , Trump is behind Democratic rival Joe Biden in national polls and in some battleground states , such as Michigan , which he won in 2016 . 
A senior campaign official said the campaign was aiming for as early as mid June to hold a rally , with preferred locations in battleground states like Wisconsin , Florida , Pennsylvania and Michigan . 
A Trump adviser said a mid June timetable might be too optimistic , that it might have to wait until after the July 4 holiday . 
The president has been told by his advisers that he is facing a race in 2020 tougher than his improbable victory in 2016 , the adviser said . 
Trump said rallies could be held first in his adopted home state of Florida or Georgia , " whoever opens first . " 
" We might do some outdoor big ones and we also may just wait until some of the stadiums can open up , " he said . 
" The demand has been incredible to get going with the rallies . "
