Destination of stricken cruise liner remains unclear My colleagues Erin Mc Cormick and Patrick Greenfield report on the future of the Zaandam cruise ship , which had been stranded off the coast of Panama but has now been allowed to pass through the Panama canal . 
The Zaandam cruise liner might have been given permission to pass through the Panama canal but the question of where the coronavirus stricken ship will be allowed to dock remains unclear . 
Holland America Line , the boat ’s owners , have previously said they planned to try to dock in Fort Lauderdale , Florida . 
But the Broward County Commissioner told the Guardian that he did not know if the cruise liner will be allowed to dock . 
Four people have died on board so far . 
" I have not gotten anything , " said Broward county commissioner Michael Udine , who had voiced his strong concerns about the ship coming into South Florida . 
" That ’s something that would have to go through Unified Command at the port first , " referencing a group which includes the US Centers for Disease Control , the US Coast Guard and the Florida Department of Health . 
" I ’m still very concerned , " he said . 
" If this ship arrives here , it ’s going to put a lot of pressure on our local health system . " 
Panamanian officials did not confirm whether the Rotterdam , another Holland America Line that has been sent to help with the rescue operation of asymptomatic passengers , would be allowed to pass through the canal .
