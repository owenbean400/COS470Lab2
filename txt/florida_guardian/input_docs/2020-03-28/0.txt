Panama ’s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal . 
No one from the ship will be allowed to disembark in Panama , however . 
It comes after a stalemate , in which Panama ’s authorities had not given approval to let the ship pass through the canal , leaving passengers stuck on board . 
They are reportedly allowing the ship to pass for " humanitarian reasons " . 
The Zaandam cruise ship , currently in Panama , has 130 people with flu like symptoms , and four have died . 
At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus . 
This will allow the ship to try and dock in Florida .
