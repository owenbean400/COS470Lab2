A New Jersey restaurant that hosted a political gala put on by a New York Republican club was ordered temporarily closed Friday over potential violations of coronavirus guidelines . 
Photos and video posted on Twitter showed dozens of maskless partiers at the New York Young Republican Club event Thursday night in Jersey City , some of whom tweeted taunting messages to Democratic New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo . 
Associated Press reports that among the attendees was US Rep . 
Matt Gaetz , a Florida Republican , and conservative political activist James O ’Keefe . 
Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop , a Democrat , said in an emailed statement that the event at the Maritime Parc restaurant in Liberty State Park was " an egregious violation " of state coronavirus guidelines and that he was ordering the restaurant temporarily closed . 
" In Jersey City we take Covid enforcement very seriously , and this event appears to be an egregious violation of the governor ’s executive orders , including capacity limitations and mandatory mask wearing , " Fulop wrote . 
" This event blatantly disregards the protections put in place to safeguard the community from further contagion and has put Jersey City and countless others at serious risk . " 
No one answered the phone at the restaurant when Associated Press tried to ring , and Gaetz did not respond to a text message Friday . 
New Jersey Gov . 
Phil Murphy , also a Democrat , has tightened restrictions on indoor gatherings recently in response to a surge in Covid 19 cases . 
Indoor dining is restricted to 25 % of a restaurant ’s capacity , and no indoor dining is allowed between 10pm and 5am . 
Indoor gatherings are limited to 10 people , with exceptions for events such as religious ceremonies .
