A coronavirus vaccine is widely believed to be the best route to ending global lockdowns and dozens of teams around the world are racing to develop one at a cost of billions of dollars . 
But despite US President Donald Trump 's prediction that a vaccine could be available by Election Day on November 3 , researchers need to go through standard development pathways before most countries will permit distribution . 
These development stages typically take years , but scientists are combining phases as they work to find a vaccine against the SARS Co V 2 at unprecedented speed . 
Some vaccine trials , for example , are combining Phase 1 and Phase 2 in order to run initial tests on several hundred people instead of smaller groups of 10-20 . 
Others have skipped the initial animal testing phase in favour of testing on humans and animals in parallel . 
Three Covid vaccines are being tested in large scale US trials . 
The first two studies -- one led by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health and the other led by Pfizer and Bio NTech -- began in late July . 
Each study was designed to enrol 30,000 participants and officials said both have enrolled about half that total . 
Bio NTech 's CEO said Tuesday he was confident the company would have a vaccine against the coronavirus ready for regulatory approval by the middle of October . 
But Moderna and Pfizer are still not enrolling minorities in their clinical trials at the levels recommended by Dr . Anthony Fauci , the US top infectious disease doctor . 
Astra Zeneca , which has been running large scale clinical trials in Great Britain , Brazil and South Africa , launched another large scale vaccine study last week in the US , involving 30,000 volunteers . 
But the drug giant said Tuesday it had paused global trials because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers -- a standard precaution to ensure experimental vaccines do not cause serious reactions among participants .
