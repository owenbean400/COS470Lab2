Bio Ntech , the German biotech company developing a Covid 19 vaccine with US pharmaceutical company Pfizer , says it has proposed an agreement to provide 200 million doses to European Union countries , with the option for a further 100 million doses . 
Delivery would start at the end of 2020 -- subject to regulatory approval -- and production would take place in Germany and Belgium , according to Bio NTech . 
Pfizer and Bio NTech plan to seek regulatory review of their BNT162b2 vaccine candidate as early as October and , if authorization is obtained , to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and approximately 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 . 
The proposed agreement with the European Commission would represent the largest initial order for Pfizer and Bio NTech to date .
