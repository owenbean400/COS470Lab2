US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said that discussions about whether to issue an emergency use authorization for a potential Covid 19 vaccine could take " days . " 
Once the FDA 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee ( VRBPAC ) meets on Dec . 10 to discuss Pfizer and Bio NTech â€™s application for an emergency use authorization for their coronavirus vaccine , the FDA could deliberate for days on whether to issue an EUA . 
" There are several steps to the vaccine authorization process . 
First , a company must apply to the FDA . 
Then , the FDA must go through the application and send it to an outside review board called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , " Hahn said . 
" That committee meets on Dec . 10 and will send the FDA its comments and recommendations . 
Only then can the FDA make a final decision on a vaccine . "
