The United States could start distributing doses of a Covid 19 vaccine " soon after " Dec . 10 , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday . 
The US Food and Drug Administration 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet on that date in December to discuss Pfizer and Bio NTech â€™s application for an emergency use authorization for their coronavirus vaccine . 
" We believe we can distribute vaccine to all 64 jurisdictions within 24 hours of FDA authorization . 
Then we hope administration could begin as soon as the product arrives , " Azar said . 
" One of the private sector partners we 've enlisted , CVS Health , has said that they expect to be vaccinating residents of nursing homes -- one of the top priority groups -- within 48 hours after FDA authorization . "
