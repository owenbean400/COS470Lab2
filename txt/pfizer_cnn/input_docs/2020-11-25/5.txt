Younger children are likely to be recruited to coronavirus vaccine trials so that any vaccines that are eventually authorized can be used to protect kids , a top US Food and Drug Administration official said . 
Right now , children as young as 12 are testing Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine . 
If it looks safe in children that young , regulators will consider testing the vaccine in younger kids , said Dr . Peter Marks , director of the FDA ’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research . 
" I suspect that there 'll be some discussion about whether there were enough individuals in that age range to allow vaccination of younger individuals . 
There may or may not be , " Marks said during a web event with Vaccinate Your Family on Tuesday . 
With adults and teens , researchers vaccinate half the volunteers with the vaccine and half get a saline shot as placebo , and they wait to see how many people in each group get infected naturally . 
But with the younger kids , Marks said , doctors may simply look to see if the children develop antibodies , or develop T cell immunity . 
" I suspect those studies will start very , very soon . 
Because , obviously , after the adult population is vaccinated , and obviously it would be ideally simultaneously , we will start to get children vaccinated particularly children at risk . 
But ultimately we all need to be vaccinated to stop this cycle of transmission , " Marks said .
