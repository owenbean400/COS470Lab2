A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee has voted to recommend the Pfizer and Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine for people aged over 16 . 
The decision came a day after the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization ( EUA ) for the vaccine . 
The vote on Saturday moved the US a step closer to getting millions of people vaccinated . 
CDC Director Robert Redfield must accept the committee 's recommendation before the vaccine can be administered . 
He was expected to do that later on Saturday . 
After months of development , emergency use was authorized following the recommendation of the FDA 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , a Pfizer spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Friday night . 
" The authorization of our vaccine in the United States was one of our most important milestones from the beginning , " Bio NTech CEO Ugur Sahin told CNN in an exclusive interview at Bio NTech 's headquarters in Mainz , Germany .
