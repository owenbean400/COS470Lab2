It 's one of the biggest logistical challenges in modern history : How will millions of Covid 19 vaccine doses that must be kept at incredibly cold temperatures be quickly shipped across continents and oceans ? 
One company is using its experience with tuna as a guide . 
Thermo King — which revolutionized the transportation of food through advances in temperature controlled shipping before World War II — is working with pharmaceutical companies , governments and logistics firms to ensure vaccines are preserved as they travel to clinics and hospitals . 
To make this happen , they 've reworked containers typically used to transport fresh tuna to Japan , which requires similar frigid conditions . 
" We took that product and we amended it , " Francesco Incalza , president Thermo King Europe , Middle East and Africa , told CNN Business . 
Tuna must be stored at - 60 degrees Celsius , or - 76 degrees Fahrenheit , to maintain its quality and deep red hue when it reaches supermarkets and restaurants , Incalza said . 
The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer ( PFE ) and Bio NTech has to be stored at - 70 degrees Celsius , or - 94 degrees Fahrenheit , while in transit . 
So Thermo King , which is part of Ireland based Trane Technologies , made some tweaks , adding additional insulation and adjusting the refrigeration system so it could get even colder . 
Now , each 20 foot long container can carry 300,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine — the first to be approved for use by Western countries following rigorous testing — by land or sea . 
Some have already been sold and are making their way around the globe . 
Incalza said this kind of innovation would normally take years to develop .
