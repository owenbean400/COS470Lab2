Moncef Slaoui , the head of the US government 's effort to develop a vaccine against Covid 19 , Sunday congratulated Pfizer and Bio NTech for delivering a coronavirus vaccine . 
Slaoui said he hopes the US will achieve herd immunity against Covid 19 in May or June . 
" We need to have immunized about 75 or 80 percent of the US population before herd immunity can be established , " Slaoui said . 
" We hope to reach that point between the month of May and the month of June . " 
He said it is critical that Americans decide to take the vaccine , and said he is very concerned about the level of vaccine hesitancy he is witnessing . 
" We hope that now that all the data is out and available to be discussed in detail that people will keep their mind open , to listen to the data , and hopefully agree that this is a very effective and safe vaccine , and therefore take it , " Slaoui said .
