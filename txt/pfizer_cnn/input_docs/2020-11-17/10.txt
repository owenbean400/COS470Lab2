More Americans are now willing to take a vaccine for Covid 19 – even before Pfizer and Moderna made their vaccine announcements – primarily because of a jump in Democrat willingness , a new Gallup poll found . 
The poll , which was conducted between Oct . 19 and Nov . 1 , found that 58 % of Americans said they would now be willing to take a Covid 19 vaccine . 
This is up from a low of 50 % in September . 
The number of people who said that they would not get a vaccine – 42 % – is down from 50 % in September , but still shows the challenges ahead when it comes to vaccine compliance . 
The largest increase in willingness came from Democrats : 69 % , compared with 53 % in September . 
People ages 45 to 64 also had a significant increase , from 36 % in September to 49 % , although they are still the age group least likely to say they would get a vaccine . 
Women and people without college degrees also had 10 point increases in willingness – women going from 44 % to 54 % and those without college degrees from 45 % to 55 % . 
For Americans who said that they would not get a vaccine , their reasoning included the rushed development timeline ( 37 % ) , wanting to confirm the vaccine is safe ( 26 % ) , not trusting vaccines in general ( 12 % ) , and wanting to wait and see how effective a vaccine will be ( 10 % ) . 
An additional 15 % gave other reasons , which included the view that the vaccine is not necessary , and politicization of a vaccine potentially comprising its safety .
