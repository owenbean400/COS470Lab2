Drugmaker Pfizer announced on Monday it would test distribution of its coronavirus vaccine candidate in four US states : Rhode Island , Texas , New Mexico , and Tennessee . 
Pfizer said last week that preliminary data indicated its experimental vaccine is more than 90 % effective in preventing symptomatic infections in people . 
The company still has to gather more data before it can apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for the vaccine . 
Temperature testing : A key part of this testing will gauge how hard it is to deal with a product that has to be kept at temperatures well below the capacity of standard freezers . 
State and local health officials , hospital representatives and others have expressed concern about the difficulty of distributing a fragile vaccine that needs constant , ultra cold refrigeration . 
Careful records will also have to be kept , to ensure that everyone who gets the vaccine receives two doses , spaced three weeks apart . 
The four states : " To build on our coordination with the relevant U.S . agencies , Pfizer launched this pilot program to help better support the states â€™ planning , deployment , and administration of the Covid 19 vaccine candidate , " the company said in a statement . 
It did not say what , precisely , would happen in the pilot program but said it would learn from the scheme to help create plans for other states . 
The four states were selected because of their differences in size , population diversity , and their varied urban and rural settings , Pfizer said .
