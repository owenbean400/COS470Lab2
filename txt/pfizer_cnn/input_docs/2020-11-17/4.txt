While it is OK to celebrate news about vaccine efficacy , it ’s not a signal to pull back on public health measures , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said on Tuesday . 
Fauci said he had previously said that he would feel good if there was a vaccine that was 70 to 75 % effective , which , combined with public health measures , could have had an impact on the outbreak . 
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine candidates have a 90 % and 94.5 % efficacy , respectively . 
" 94.5 % for this and more than 90 % for the Pfizer candidate , to me , is a very , very important advance in our armamentarium of trying to stop this outbreak , " he said . 
However , vaccines wo not do it alone . 
" That ’s the important point , this should not be a signal to pull back on the public health measures that we must continue to implement , " said Fauci .
