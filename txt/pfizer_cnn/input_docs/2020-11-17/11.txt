Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Tuesday that he has " zero concerns " about the cold chain requirements associated with Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine . 
The vaccine needs to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius , or more than minus 100 degrees F — far colder than the standard freezers kept in doctors ’ offices , pharmacies and state labs . 
Pfizer plans to distribute the vaccine using custom made boxes created by the company ’s engineers , Bourla said in an interview hosted by The New York Times . 
Bourla said that each box can hold about 1,000 to 5,000 vaccine doses . 
He said that the boxes eliminate the need for additional refrigeration during delivery . 
" We can ship it in normal cars , trucks , airplanes , boats , whatever , " he said . 
Bourla said Pfizer will be able to ship the vaccine to most places in the US overnight . 
" Once we receive an address from the government , the next day , the product will be there , " he said . 
" Once people receive it , they can keep it for weeks in the box , or they can keep it for months in freezers . " 
Bourla said he is more concerned about the demand for the vaccine than the storage requirements . 
" The biggest challenge will be that in the beginning , the dose availability will be smaller than the demand , " he said .
