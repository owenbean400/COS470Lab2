A Covid 19 vaccine could be delivered as early as the end of the year , according to German company Bio NTech and US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer . 
" Based on current projections we expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021 , " the companies said in a press release last week . 
The two companies announced last week that their candidate vaccine was more than 90 % effective in preventing infection in volunteers , per preliminary data . 
The vaccine uses a never before approved technology called messenger RNA , or m RNA , to produce an immune response in people who are vaccinated . 
The m RNA works by tricking cells into producing bits of protein that look like pieces of the virus . 
The immune system learns to recognize and attack those bits and , in theory , would react fast to any actual infection .
