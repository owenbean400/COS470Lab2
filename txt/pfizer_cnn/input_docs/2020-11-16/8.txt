While two coronavirus vaccine candidates , Pfizer and Moderna , now show high efficacy rates , Americans should not be hoping for any authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration before the last half of December , experts agreed . 
And even when the vaccine finally becomes available , Chicago plans to first provide it to health care workers , who are at high risk of exposure , according to Dr . Allison Arwady , Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health . 
The first batch of vaccines that the city gets may not be enough to cover all of its health care workers , Arwady added . 
" We have a sense how many doses we would need , " she said Monday . 
" There are hundreds of thousands of health care workers in Chicago and we 'll probably get maybe 150,000 between the two vaccines . " 
There are plans in place to push the vaccine out as soon as it becomes available , Arwady said , adding that the city is equipped to accept and distribute any amount of vaccine that it gets . 
There 's been work done to prioritize based on population .
