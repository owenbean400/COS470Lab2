Moderna 's coronavirus vaccine candidate is " more flexible " because " it can be kept in regular freezer refrigeration , " US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Monday on Fox and Friends . 
Pfizer 's vaccine candidate has to be kept at minus 75 degrees Celsius â€” or about minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit . 
No other vaccine in the US needs to be kept that cold , and doctors ' offices and pharmacies do not have freezers that go that low . 
Moderna 's vaccine can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius , which is about minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit . 
Other vaccines , such as the one against chickenpox , need to be kept at that temperature . 
On Moderna 's vaccine , Azar said : CORRECTION : A previous version of this post misstated the temperature the Moderna vaccine can be kept . 
It 's minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit .
