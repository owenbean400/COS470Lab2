Moderna announced this morning that its coronavirus vaccine is 94.5 % effective against the virus , making it the second vaccine in the United States to have a stunningly high success rate . 
Last week , Pfizer announced that early data show its vaccine is more than 90 % effective against the disease . 
While the two vaccines appear to have very similar safety and efficacy profiles , Moderna 's vaccine has a significant practical advantage over Pfizer 's . 
Pfizer 's vaccine has to be kept at minus 75 degrees Celsius â€” or about minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit . 
No other vaccine in the US needs to be kept that cold , and doctors ' offices and pharmacies do not have freezers that go that low . 
Moderna 's vaccine can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius , which is about minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit . 
Other vaccines , such as the one against chickenpox , need to be kept at that temperature . 
That means Moderna 's vaccine can be kept in " a readily available freezer that is available in most doctors ' offices and pharmacies , " said Dr . Tal Zacks , Moderna 's chief medical officer . 
" We leverage infrastructure that already exists for other marketed vaccines . " 
Another advantage of Moderna 's vaccine is that it can be kept for 30 days in the refrigerator , the company announced Monday . 
Pfizer 's vaccine can last only five days in the refrigerator . 
CORRECTION : A previous version of this post misstated the temperature the Moderna vaccine can be kept . 
It 's minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit .
