Moderna 's coronavirus vaccine is " 94.5 % effective " in preventing infection , according to early data released by the American biotechnology company on Monday . 
The results come hot on the heels of an announcement by US based pharmaceutical company Pfizer last week that its vaccine candidate was 90 % effective . 
The early results showed the vaccine protected people from getting both mild and severe forms of Covid 19 , according to the company . 
In Moderna â€™s trial , 15,000 study participants were given a placebo , which is a shot of saline that has no effect . 
Over several months , 90 of those people developed Covid 19 . 
Another 15,000 participants were given the vaccine , and five of them developed Covid 19 . 
Among those receiving a placebo , 11 became severely ill , but none of the participants who received the vaccine became severely ill . 
The company said its vaccine did not have any significant side effects . 
A small percentage of those who received it experienced symptoms such as body aches and headaches . 
Moderna plans to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its vaccine soon after it accumulates more safety data later this month . 
Fauci said he expects the first vaccinations to begin " towards the latter part of December , rather than the early part of December . "
