A top US Food and Drug ( FDA ) official on Thursday claimed that Britain beat the US to authorizing a coronavirus vaccine because US regulators take more care . 
Dr . Peter Marks , director of the FDA ’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , told an American Medical Association webinar that the FDA is taking great care in considering emergency use authorization requests from vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna . 
Other countries trust the companies ’ data as submitted , he said . 
" There is a cost that another regulator has made this available sooner than we will and that ’s because we ’re really taking care to make sure that when people get this vaccine , we will have really vetted it for safety and if there is something there , we ’ll know about it . " 
Earlier this week , Britain authorized Pfizer ’s vaccine . 
The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee December 10 to discuss the emergency use authorization . 
" We ’re getting there as fast as we can because we understand people are losing their lives to this virus . "
