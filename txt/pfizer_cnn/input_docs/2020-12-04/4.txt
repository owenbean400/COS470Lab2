The makers of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid 19 vaccines insist they did not cut corners in the development of the shots , which normally take years . 
He said that taking out some of the business and financial caution that normally slows down development of drugs helped speed up the process in developing a Covid 19 vaccine . 
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla agreed no corners were cut in speeding up the development process . 
He cited the 30,000 person clinical trial as the " gold standard , " too . 
" That happens exactly as would happen with any other vaccine , " he told host Lester Holt . 
Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied for emergency use authorization for their vaccines from the US Food and Drug Administration . 
Pfizer ’s will be considered December 10 and Moderna ’s December 17 . 
Johnson & Johnson has a coronavirus vaccine that is still in a Phase 3 clinical trial , but company CEO Alex Gorsky said the development process is the same as it would be for any other vaccine .
