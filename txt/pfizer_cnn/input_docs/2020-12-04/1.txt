The first doses of Pfizer Bio NTech 's Covid 19 vaccine arrived in the UK on Thursday -- a day after the country approved the vaccine for distribution , according to British media . 
Pfizer and Downing Street declined to comment to CNN , citing security reasons . 
The UK â€™s Department of Health told CNN that up to 800,000 doses of the vaccine are being made available next week . 
The vaccines were carried by a fleet of unmarked trucks through the Eurotunnel from Belgium and are on their way to undisclosed storage facilities in England , Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland , according to CNN affiliate ITV News . 
The in demand vaccine will be distributed from these storage facilities early next week to 50 hospital hubs acting as vaccination points , according to the health ministry . 
First vaccine approval : The UK became the first western country to authorize use of a coronavirus vaccine . 
The country has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer jab , enough to vaccinate 20 million people -- roughly a third of the UK 's population -- as the vaccination involves two shots administered at least three weeks apart .
