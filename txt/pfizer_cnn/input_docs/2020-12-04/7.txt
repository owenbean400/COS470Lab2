Karen and Steve Coma , a North Carolina couple , said it was " public service " and " doing our part " that compelled them to volunteer in the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine trial . 
" We both — my mother , Steve 's parents — have people that are at an at risk age or state and felt it was important for us to help expedite this , " Karen said . 
Her mother , who has dementia and is in a long term care facility , just tested positive for Covid 19 yesterday . 
Her mother does not have any symptoms and is " doing fine , " Karen said . 
While they do not know if they received the actual vaccine or if they received a placebo , they have a guess . 
Steve said he had some mild muscle ache and tiredness , while Karen and their daughter — who also participated in the trial — did not experience any side effects . 
" It would not prevent me from going to work , really just sort of mild symptoms , " he said . 
Their message for anyone wary about taking a vaccine ? 
" Overcome that hesitation and get vaccinated … Break the cycle , " Steve said .
