The National Vaccine Advisory Committee ( NVAC ) voted Friday to not recommend issuing emergency use authorization for administering a Covid 19 vaccine in children . 
" NVAC will warn against issuing an EUA for Covid 19 vaccines in children , considering that children experience generally mild disease , " the committee wrote in its recommendation . 
The committee , which advises the Health and Human Services Department on the best ways to adequately provide vaccines , also voted on a series of recommendations responding to questions posed by Assistant Secretary for Health Adm . Brett Giroir regarding Covid 19 vaccine safety and surveillance . 
NVAC recommended that vaccine developers begin including pregnant women in Phase 2 of its trials . 
The US Food and Drug Administration ’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet Dec . 10 to discuss Pfizer ’s application for an EUA for its coronavirus vaccine . 
The FDA can attach restrictions to any EUA . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention then decides who receives the vaccine .
