Sanofi Pasteur and Glaxo Smith Kline said Thursday they are starting early stage trials of their experimental coronavirus vaccine , one of several being backed by the US federal government ’s Operation Warp Speed . 
The companies said they were recruiting 440 healthy adults at 11 trial sites to test out the vaccine in a randomized , double blind and placebo controlled trial . 
Researchers will watch to see if the vaccine is safe and whether it induces an immune response . 
The companies are working together using Sanofi ’s flu vaccine technology and Glaxo ’s adjuvant -- a compound that boosts the power of a vaccine . 
In July , the companies won a $ 2.1 billion commitment from the US federal government . 
The deal commits them to produce up to 100 million doses of vaccine next year , with an option for 500 million more doses . 
Several other experimental coronavirus vaccines have started human clinical trials in the US , including those made by Moderna , Pfizer , Astra Zeneca , Inovio , Novavax and Johnson & Johnson .
