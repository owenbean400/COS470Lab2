Vaccine maker Moderna started its final , phase 3 trial of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States Monday , and this is the stage that ca not be sped up , a top vaccine expert said . 
Development of a coronavirus vaccine has been extremely fast so far , Dr . Paul Offit , the director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia , told CNN . 
But the last part , the Phase 3 trial , will have to be taken more slowly , he said . 
" The proof is in the pudding . 
The Phase 3 trial ’s the pudding and now you ’re going to test hopefully 10 , 15 or 20 thousand people that will get this vaccine , 15,000 people that will get placebo and you ’ll see to what extent this is really safe and you ’ll see to what extent it ’s effective . " 
Data on whether the Moderna vaccine prevents infection should be available by the end of the year , and , if all goes well , it should be available for use by early 2021 , although the vaccination process will take months . 
" I ’m willing to wait to see the data , " Offit said . 
Mitigate risk : Offit said the Phase 3 trial helps to mitigate any sense of risk . 
" If you test it on 10,000 or 15,000 people and you find that it ’s safe , you can say it does not have an uncommon side effect problem , " he said . 
But very rare side effects wo not become obvious until after the vaccine is on the market , he said . 
Pfizer and its partner Bio NTech also said Monday they were about to start a phase 2/3 trial of their experimental coronavirus vaccine in the US .
