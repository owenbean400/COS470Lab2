Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's leading infectious disease expert , will be among the first people to see the data that will tell the country whether one of the experimental coronavirus vaccines being tested actually works to protect against the virus , the National Institutes of Health confirmed Friday . 
Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the NIH , which is sponsoring some of the vaccine trials . 
Those include the vaccines being developed by Moderna , Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson . 
Four of six vaccines are in advanced , Phase 3 clinical trials and independent advisers known as data and safety monitoring boards or DSMBs are watching the results to see how many volunteers become infected with coronavirus after receiving either the vaccine or a dummy shot . 
These DSMBs make the decision about whether to stop the trials and share the data with the trial sponsors . 
That would be both the company developing the vaccine and , in the case of those sponsored by NIAID , the US government . 
Fauci ’s role was first reported by Pro Publica . 
One vaccine being developed without the involvement of the federal government is Pfizer ’s .
