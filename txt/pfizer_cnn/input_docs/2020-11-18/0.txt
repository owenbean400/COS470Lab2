Dr . Francis Collins hopes most Americans will be immune to Covid 19 by next summer after receiving coronavirus vaccines . 
The director of the National Institutes of Health told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer he expects Pfizer and Moderna shots could be available as soon as next month for those at greatest risk . 
" If these two vaccines do get approval , emergency use authorization , there will be about 40 million doses ready to be delivered in December , " Collins said . 
People will need two doses of either vaccine . 
" So that 's 20 million people that can be immunized and we will need to make sure that is utilized for the highest risk people , " he said . 
More doses will become available every month after that , Collins said , and there are other vaccine candidates that may also win approval . 
Collins noted that Americans will need to agree to get the vaccine , once it ’s available . 
" My hope is now with more data and with a reassurance that this is being done in a highly independent , non political way that people will begin to trust that this is something that they will want to take advantage . 
I know I will , " he said .
