The German biotech company Bio NTech is working on a formula for its vaccine that would allow it to be shipped at room temperature , CEO Uğur Şahin told CNN ’s Frederik Pleitgen in an exclusive interview on Wednesday . 
Concerns were raised that it would be difficult to distribute the vaccine Bio NTech is working on with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer because it needs to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius , which is about 50 degrees colder than any vaccine currently used in the United States . 
Doctors ' offices , pharmacies and state labs do not have freezers that go nearly that low but Sahin is now saying that is a temporary issue . 
" Since the development was so fast , we were not able to work out better , more stable conditions , " he said . 
" We believe that in the second half of 2020 we will have come up with a formulation which is comparable to any other type of vaccine . "
