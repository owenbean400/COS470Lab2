The Pfizer vaccine trial has reached its safety milestone and the company is preparing to file for emergency use authorization , Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Tuesday . 
Pfizer announced on Nov . 9 that its coronavirus vaccine appears to be more than 90 % effective , based on early data . 
But the company did not yet have enough data to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration , which said it also wanted at least two months of safety data on at least half of a vaccine trial â€™s volunteers starting from when they got their second immunization . 
Bourla said they are not yet sure how durable the protection from their vaccine will be . 
The Pfizer vaccine uses a messenger RNA , or m RNA , platform to produce an immune response . 
" With the m RNA technology , you can boost as soon as you want , " said Bourla . 
People can be given an additional dose of a vaccine once immunity wears off , referred to as a boost . 
Bourla said that a boost , if needed , would likely require only one dose .
