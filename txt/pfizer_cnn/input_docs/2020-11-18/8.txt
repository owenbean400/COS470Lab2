The United States plans to have about 40 million doses of Covid 19 vaccine available to distribute by the end of the year , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a briefing on Wednesday . 
The companies Pfizer and Moderna this week both announced that their vaccine candidates were about 95 % effective in Phase 3 trials . 
Pfizer on Wednesday said final Phase 3 data confirmed the efficacy and it ’s planning to apply for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday . 
The FDA must authorize any vaccine , but doses have already been manufactured in the hope that one or more would get authorization . 
" By the end of December , we expect to have about 40 million doses of these two vaccines available for distribution pending FDA authorization — enough to vaccinate about 20 million of our most vulnerable Americans , " Azar said . 
" And production of course would continue to ramp up after that . "
