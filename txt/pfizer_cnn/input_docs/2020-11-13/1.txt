An influential Covid 19 model is projecting that 438,941 people will have died from Covid 19 by March 1 , 2021 . 
The projection is from the the team at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) at the University of Washington School of Medicine . 
They said the new figure accounts for a reduced infection fatality rate . 
This is the first time the model has made projections as far out as March 1 . 
The model predicts 36 states will see " extreme or high stress " on hospital beds by mid December through February , with extreme stress meaning 20 % of beds are filled by Covid 19 patients and high stress reflecting 10 % to 19 % are occupied by Covid 19 patients . 
This could lead to a reduction in elective surgeries , similar to what happened last spring , the IHME said . 
The death toll could hit a staggering 587,000 by March 1 , the IHME said if states relax social distancing measures and mask mandates . 
What about a vaccine : A potential coronavirus vaccine , which could be available to some populations by next month , has not yet been factored into the model . 
Dr . Chris Murray said his group plans to build the Pfizer vaccine into the model in the next couple of weeks -- as well as any other vaccines that might be ready for emergency use authorization .
