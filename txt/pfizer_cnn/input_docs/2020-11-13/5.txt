Retail drug chain Walgreens says it is " rapidly expanding " its ultra cold storage capabilities to accommodate a potential Pfizer coronavirus vaccine that needs to be stored at around minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 75 degrees Celsius ) . 
Walgreens spokesperson Kelli Teno told CNN the company felt " confident we can support the successful administration of these vaccines once available . " 
The US Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday it is partnering with large chain pharmacies and networks that represent independent pharmacies to help distribute vaccines once one gets authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
Dry ice is in short supply in some areas of the country . 
When asked whether the federal government was helping retailers get dry ice , Teno said she did not think so , adding that Wagreens had relationships with manufacturers and distributors that can provide this . 
Paul Ostrowski , Operation Warp Speed â€™s director of supply , production , and distribution , told CNN Thursday that rural areas and any parts of the country not equipped to receive the vaccine would not receive it .
