US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Friday praised the efforts of Pfizer for record time research and a vaccine " with 94 % efficacy positive data , " but acknowledged there are " unique challenges " for distributing the vaccine . 
Azar said that CVS and Walgreens will be available to assist nursing homes , skilled nursing and assisted living facilities with mass vaccination programs , if the data and science support vaccinating those populations with the Pfizer vaccine . 
When asked if the country should shut down now there is a surge in Covid 19 cases , Azar said he did not believe that was the way to go . 
" The Europeans have placed a primacy on keeping their universities , and their K through 12 schools , open ; they 've done so even as they take other aggressive measures in their countries . 
We need to be having the same type of prioritization , our kids and our safe settings , keeping those open , and then taking interventions that all of us can do that are common sense that will prevent the spread of disease in our personal lives , " said Azar .
