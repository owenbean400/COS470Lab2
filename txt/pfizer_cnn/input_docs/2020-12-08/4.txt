As cases of Covid 19 continue to rise across the United States , a poll of firefighters in the Fire Department of New York City ( FDNY ) found that nearly 55 % of respondents would not get a Covid 19 vaccine if offered by the department , their union president told CNN Monday .

Over 2,000 firefighters , or about 25 % of the department 's approximately 8,200 members , responded to the poll , according to Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro .
