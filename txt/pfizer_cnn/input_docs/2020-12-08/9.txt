Officials leading the White House 's " Operation Warp Speed " effort to mass produce a coronavirus vaccine passed up a chance to purchase more than the current total of 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine as part of a concerted effort to keep the administration 's options open to other vaccines being developed at the same time , an administration familiar with the situation said . 
The official said the decision was made as part of a plan to " diversify " the nation 's vaccine arsenal through the purchase of millions of doses from Pfizer 's rivals . 
At the time , officials at " Operation Warp Speed " had no idea the Pfizer vaccine was going to be this effective . 
" The plan was to diversify and do not put all your eggs in one basket , " the official continued . 
Now , the US simply may have to hope that the other vaccines being produced by other companies are just as effective as the Pfizer doses , the official said . 
If the other vaccines being manufactured by Pfizer 's rivals do not perform at the same level , it could have a detrimental effect on inoculating the American public , the official said , noting it may be difficult to match Pfizer 's efficacy rate . 
" It 's going to look bad , " the official continued , if the other vaccines do not perform as well as the doses from Pfizer . 
But the official said the hope is that the other vaccines will be as effective as the Pfizer doses .
