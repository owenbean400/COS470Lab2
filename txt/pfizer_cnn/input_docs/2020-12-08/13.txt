The United States will likely have a third Covid 19 vaccine in February , Moncef Slaoui , chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed , said Tuesday . 
The Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines could both be authorized for emergency use before the end of December . 
The US Food and Drug Administration 's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet on Thursday to discuss Pfizer 's application for emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine candidate . 
A similar meeting is scheduled next week for Moderna 's vaccine candidate . 
Slaoui noted that other vaccines are in development , including Johnson & Johnson ’s vaccine , which is in Phase 3 trials and requires only one dose . 
Slaoui said that a one shot vaccine is " a major advantage , " especially in the context of a pandemic . 
" That vaccine is likely to complete its efficacy trial , in terms of assessing efficacy of the vaccine , probably early in the month of January , and hopefully would file for emergency use authorization either late in January or early in February , " Slaoui said . 
He added that Astra Zeneca ’s vaccine , which uses similar technology , is also in Phase 3 trials . 
" We project that efficacy may be achieved somewhere in the end of January or early February , and maybe by late February or early March , that vaccine could become available , if approved by the FDA , " he said .
