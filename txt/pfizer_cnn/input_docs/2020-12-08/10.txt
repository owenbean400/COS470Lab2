Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that while the company saw some level of protection twelve days after the first dose of their Covid 19 vaccine , " the protection is not full . " 
Bourla added that from an epidemiology point of view , this is important because when a population starts having some type of immunity from the first dose , " that helps . " 
" But again , I say , it ’s a very big mistake if anyone tries to do it with only one dose when … with two , you almost double the protection , " he said . 
Bourla 's comments come after the United Kingdom became the world 's first nation to begin vaccinating its citizens with a fully vetted and authorized Covid 19 shot — the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine .
