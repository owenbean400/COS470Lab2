New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that while the world is 10 months into the pandemic crisis , there is finally an " end in sight " as " next week the vaccine will be here in NYC . " 
" We have one more big battle ahead , " he said , stressing that everyone just needs to get through the next few winter months . 
Remember : The US Food and Drug Administration 's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet on Thursday to discuss Pfizer 's application for emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine candidate . 
A similar meeting is scheduled next week for Moderna 's vaccine candidate . 
FDA officials say their decisions on the vaccines could come days to weeks after the meetings â€” it depends on what questions come up .
