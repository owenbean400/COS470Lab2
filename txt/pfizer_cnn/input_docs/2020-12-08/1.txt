We have heard it said multiple times : Operation Warp Speed will start moving vaccine doses within 24 hours of the Food and Drug Administration granting emergency use authorization , or EUA . 
But what happens after that ? 
OWS Chief of Plans , Operations and Analysis Deacon Maddox gave a clearer picture Monday of what they expect the process to look like beyond that first delivery of vaccine . 
According to Maddox , if the vaccine is approved Friday , they 'll ship Saturday . 
The following week they will be in constant contact with Pfizer . 
" I will put the number into Tiberius , and then we will allocate that , and then we 'll adjust the states . " 
Tiberius is OWS â€™ IT system for tracking and allocating vaccines . 
The hope is for a constant flow of vaccine as the manufacturers push it out . 
To start with , Pfizer has just over 6 million doses . 
" That 's the way that we envisioned this -- a constant flow . 
Every week , bank on it , " Maddox said .
