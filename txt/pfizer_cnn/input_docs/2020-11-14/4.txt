By the time Moderna and Pfizer apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization for their coronavirus vaccines , there will likely be even more data to show how well the vaccines work , according to two doctors involved with the process . 
On Monday , Pfizer announced that 94 participants in their Phase 3 clinical trial had become ill with Covid 19 , and the vaccine was more than 90 % effective . 
Wednesday , Moderna announced that 53 participants in its trial had become ill , and efficacy data should be available by the end of the month . 
By the time the two companies apply for emergency use authorizations from the FDA , many more participants will have become ill , giving an even clearer picture about how well the vaccine works . 
For example , by the time Pfizer sends its data to the FDA , there might be an additional 70 trial participants who will have become sick with Covid 19 , instead of just the 94 announced on Monday , according to Dr . Larry Corey , who runs the Covid 19 Prevention Network created by the National Institutes of Health . 
How it works : In the trials , half of the participants received the vaccine , and half the placebo , which is a shot of saline that does nothing . 
Months then went by while the participants were out in their communities , and some of them contracted Covid 19 . 
An independent board of experts then looks to see how many of the people who became ill received the vaccine and how many received the placebo , which tells you how effective the vaccine is . 
More data also gives more information about how the vaccine works for particular subgroups , such as the elderly or racial minorities . 
" It will ultimately help answer the question -- will this work for me ? " said Corey , a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center . 
The reason so many more participants will develop Covid 19 is because rates in the US have been skyrocketing in recent weeks , Corey said .
