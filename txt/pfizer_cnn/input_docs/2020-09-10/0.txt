Astra Zeneca should still be on track to have a set of data to submit for approval of a Covid 19 vaccine before the end of the year , despite having to pause the trial because of an illness in a volunteer , company CEO Pascal Soriot said Thursday . 
The company has been working with Britain ’s University of Oxford to develop the vaccine . 
The trial has shown promising early results , but was paused Tuesday because of an unexplained illness in one of its volunteers . 
Regulators will review the data to determine when and if the trial can proceed . 
Experts said it ’s common for vaccine trials to pause for investigators to review results . 
The World Health Organization ’s chief scientist said Thursday that it is a normal procedure that is good clinical practice . 
Soriot said the company will be ready to resume manufacturing once the trial starts up again . 
He said he believes that the late stage trials being conducted by Pfizer and Moderna could also produce results quickly and that those vaccines also have the potential to be released before the end of the year .
