The German regulatory authority , the Paul Ehrlich Institut , has approved a phase 2/3 clinical trial in Germany of a Covid 19 vaccine candidate being developed by US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German biotechnology company Bio NTech . 
The BNT162b2 m RNA based vaccine candidate is already in similar large scale trials in the United States . 
The trial involves giving the participants two doses of a 30 microgram vaccine – one on the first day and one 28 days later – with participants being followed up for up to two years after they receive the second dose . 
In August , the companies presented " promising " results in early data on safety and immune responses in their ongoing Phase 1/2 study in the United States . 
Among both younger and older adults in the trial , the companies said the vaccine " was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20 % of the participants . " 
The companies also noted in their news release that seven days after participants were given a second dose of the vaccine at 30 micrograms , the vaccine was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies in younger adults ages 18 to 55 , and in older adults ages 65 to 85 . 
Remember : The data has not yet published in a peer reviewed medical journal . 
The companies plan to seek regulatory authorization or approval for the drug as early as October if it is successful in clinical trial testing . 
They plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 . 
Many infectious disease experts say , however , that it ’s highly unlikely Pfizer will have enough data to allow for an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in October .
