The Moderna Covid 19 vaccine will be going to more sites than the Pfizer vaccine , partly due to the fact that it can be accommodated in more places , US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during an Operation Warp Speed news briefing Monday . 
" This first wave of Moderna shipments will be sent to more than 3,500 sites , a greater number than the Pfizer vaccine was sent to , in part because the Moderna vaccine can be accommodated in more sites , including harder to reach and more rural places , " Azar said . 
" As we move forward , states will continue to adjust where they want these doses shipped to meet their needs , " he added . 
Azar also spoke about recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , which made more recommendations about who should get the vaccine next . 
The committee voted 13-1 on Sunday to prioritize adults ages 75 and older and frontline essential workers to receive Covid 19 vaccines in Phase 1b of allocation . 
The committee vote also included prioritizing adults ages 65 to 75 , people ages 16 to 64 who have high risk medical conditions , and other essential workers in Phase 1c of allocation . 
" Those recommendations are there for states and other public health jurisdictions to use , " Azar said . 
" We believe that these jurisdictions and their leaders are in the best position to understand their specific needs and allocate vaccines in these early days to save the most lives possible . "
