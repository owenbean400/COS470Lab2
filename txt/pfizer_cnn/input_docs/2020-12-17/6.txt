The US Food and Drug Administration 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will hold a virtual meeting today to consider emergency use authorization of the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine . 
That meeting was set to begin at 9 a.m . ET . 
The FDA has already telegraphed that a quick emergency use authorization can be expected and this one could go through even faster than the EUA for Pfizer last week â€“ itself a speedy process . 
Here 's why : The Moderna vaccine is very similar to Pfizer 's and Bio NTech 's vaccine . 
Both use a new approach involving genetic material known as messenger RNA or m RNA . 
" Really , they do seem quite similar , " added Malkin , who has studied both the Pfizer and the Moderna data . 
" I think they are very likely to authorize it quickly . "
