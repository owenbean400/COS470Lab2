A trial is being designed to assess whether Covid 19 vaccines can prevent people from carrying the virus , Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , said Thursday . 
Both Pfizer and Moderna â€™s Covid 19 vaccines have shown to prevent some degree of illness from the virus . 
Moderna said this week that data suggests its vaccine can prevent asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection . 
" Could you still be contagious , even though the vaccine has kept you from getting sick ? " 
Collins asked . 
" We do not think that 's likely to be a big deal , but you got to have the data to find out . "
