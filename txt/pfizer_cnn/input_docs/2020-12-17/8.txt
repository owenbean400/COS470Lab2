Dr . Doran Fink , deputy director of the Clinical Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications , said medical providers should monitor patients who get the Covid 19 vaccine for an allergic reaction . 
Two Alaska health care workers had an allergic reaction minutes after getting the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine earlier this week . 
Both have recovered . 
Scientific experts have said that , while possible , allergic reactions should be rare . 
" We learned of these cases through established safety surveillance systems that worked exactly as designed , " Fink said at the VRBPAC meeting convened today to consider the authorization of Moderna ’s vaccine , which is similar to Pfizer/Bio NTech ’s . 
Fink added that the FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention are also in touch with public health authorities in the UK . 
Two health care workers with a history of vaccine allergies also had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine . 
Both are said to have recovered quickly . 
Fink said the FDA is working with Pfizer to revise the fact sheets and prescribing information that accompany the vaccine to emphasize the CDC guidelines that require medical providers to monitor people for allergic reactions , and to have medical treatment available immediately if someone does have an allergic reaction . 
Fink said they will do the same for the Moderna vaccine if it is granted an emergency use authorization .
