People administering Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine may squeeze out extra doses from the vials if there is leftover solution in them after giving the standard five doses , the US Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday . 
Pfizer vaccine is shipped as a frozen solution , which is diluted with saline before it is given to people . 
Politico first reported that some pharmacists had found they could get six and possibly even seven doses of vaccine out of the vials , which are designed to provide five doses of vaccine each . 
" FDA is aware of the issue and working with Pfizer to determine the best path forward , and will share additional updates as we have them , " an FDA spokesperson told CNN . 
US health officials say they have shipped out more than 2.9 million doses of Pfizer ’s vaccine this week . 
They are giving it to frontline health care workers and residents of long term care facilities . 
Pfizer is working to make vaccine as it is rolled out and the US government has estimated it will have about 20 million doses of Pfizer vaccine by the end of the month .
