Britain ’s authorization of Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine should give Americans more confidence in the safety of the vaccine and should speed authorization in the United States , US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday . 
" While the FDA completes its review , the approval of another independent regulatory body should give Americans additional confidence in the quality of such a vaccine , " Azar told a briefing . 
The FDA ’s vaccine advisers are scheduled to discuss Pfizer ’s application for emergency use authorization on December 10 .
