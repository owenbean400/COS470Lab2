" If everything goes well , I expect that first people could get the first vaccinations beginning next week , " Bio NTech CEO Ugur Sahin says after the UK approved its Covid 19 vaccine in collaboration with Pfizer . 
The US Food and Drug Administration is still reviewing the vaccine but Sahin says if and when the vaccine gets approved , the roll out could be " very fast . " 
" We will deliver up to 50 million doses to the different regions in 2020 . 
So that means a significant proportion of those doses would also go to the United States , " he told CNN . 
" Technically , we are prepared to start the rollout . 
It depends , of course , on the regulatory approval . " 
A big logistical challenge for the vaccine is its storage requirements that also make its transportation complicated . 
Sahin says the team is working on a " second generation formula " which could allow its transportation at room temperature and it " will be available most likely in the second half of 2021 . " 
To ensure that the vaccine actually stops the coronavirus pandemic , the vaccination rate needs to be at least 60 % to 70 % , Sahin says .
