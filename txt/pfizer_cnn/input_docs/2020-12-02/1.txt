The US federal government will pay for dry ice to help out jurisdictions that do not have the freezers needed to store Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine , a source familiar with Operation Warp Speed told CNN Tuesday . 
The Food and Drug Administration has asked its vaccine advisers to meet Dec . 10 to discuss Pfizer ’s application for emergency use authorization for its vaccine . 
The temperature problem : States , cities and territories have worried about how they could handle the delicate vaccine if it is approved and distributed . 
The vaccine must be shipped and stored at temperatures of around minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit , or minus 75 degrees Celsius . 
That requires a special freezer that most hospitals , pharmacies or clinics do not have . 
The solution : The federal government 's plans to handle this problem were shared in a call with the health care industry , the source said . 
Jurisdictions without an ultra low freezer will automatically receive a complimentary shipment of dry ice within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine suitcase . 
The dry ice will be paid for and shipped by the federal government , the source told CNN . 
The shipment will include the scoop , goggles , and cryogenic gloves needed to safely handle the dry ice . 
The government is also contracting with the company making temperature monitoring devices that will be fitted onto each suitcase to ensure the vaccines inside never thaw out and get ruined . 
The suitcase will carry a log to notate temperature . 
Each box can be used with the dry ice for five days and refreshed twice , meaning that the vaccine must be administered within a 15 day period . 
There may also be an option to refrigerate the vaccine for 20 days .
