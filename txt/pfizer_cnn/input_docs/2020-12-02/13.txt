About 100 million Americans could be vaccinated against coronavirus by February , Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed , said Wednesday . 
" All the investments we have made in scaling up and starting to stockpile manufacturing of the vaccines allow us to stay confident that we will be able to distribute 20 million vaccines , enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the US in December , " Slaoui told a news briefing . 
The United States has said if both Pfizer and Moderna win US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization in December , they could distribute 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of the month . 
Each vaccine requires two doses , so that ’s enough to fully vaccinate 20 million people . 
An FDA 's committee is scheduled to meet meet on Dec . 10 and Dec . 17 to review Pfizer 's and Moderna 's coronavirus vaccine candidates , respectively . 
FDA officials say their decisions on the vaccines could come days to weeks after the meetings — it depends on what questions come up . 
Slaoui said he expected 60 million more vaccines by the end of January . 
He said that covers many of the high priority groups , including health care workers and people at high risk of severe disease and death from Covid 19 .
