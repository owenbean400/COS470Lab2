Moderna says the US is playing a pivotal role in bringing the vaccine to the world . 
" We got a billion dollars for funding the clinical trial . 
So , basically the US government , if you think about it , has offered to the world the cost of developing Moderna 's vaccine , " Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel said at a World Economic Forum conference on vaccines on Wednesday . 
Bancel said the company is on track to provide 500 million to 1 billion doses next year , in addition to the 20 millions doses they will have available by the end of this year , despite being a company of just 1,000 people . 
" The team is working as hard as they can 24/7 , literally , to get as many products as we can out the door . 
We know that lives depend on it . 
We 're losing tens of thousands of people a day around the world , " he said . 
Moderna applied on Monday to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its Covid 19 vaccine . 
Moderna is the second company to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine . 
Pfizer applied on Nov . 20 with data showing similarly high efficacy . 
The FDA is scheduled to meet with its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on Dec . 10 to review Pfizer 's application and on Dec.17 to review Moderna 's application .
