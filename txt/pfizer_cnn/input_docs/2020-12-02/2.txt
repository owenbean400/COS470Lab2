Britain has become the first country to allow the use of Pfizer and its German partner Bio NTech 's Covid 19 vaccine after it was granted temporary authorization for emergency use , the companies announced . 
This marks the first time that citizens outside of the worldwide clinical trials will have the opportunity to be immunized against Covid 19 , according to Bio NTech CEO Ugur Sahin . 
Pfizer and Bio NTech previously said that analysis of the vaccine showed it was 95 % effective with no safety concerns . 
The vaccine will be made available across the UK starting next week , said a spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care in a statement . 
More details will be released soon , including advice for priority groups like the elderly and health care staff to receive the vaccine . 
" To aid the success of the vaccination programme it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed , " the spokesperson said . 
Sahin added that the regulatory data was the result of " a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development program . " 
The companies had previously signed an agreement to supply 40 million doses to the UK with delivery in 2020 and 2021 .
