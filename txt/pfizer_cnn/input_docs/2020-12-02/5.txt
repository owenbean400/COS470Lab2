Sean Marett , chief business and commercial officer at Bio NTech , has explained how the company will get the vaccine to the UK : The doses are currently being packed in a Pfizer facility in Belgium , very quickly . 
Thermoboxes are being packed that allow between 1000-5000 doses , which they will ship either by truck or by plane . 
The boxes are temperature controlled with a tracker to provide minute by minute updates before being delivered to a site for distribution . 
" The UK is first approval today , of course we are absolutely delighted by that , " Marett said at a Bio NTech press conference in Mainz , Germany . 
He said the company and Pfizer were committed to shipping the vaccine to the UK , even with the possibility of hold ups due to a no deal Brexit : " If there is disruption , then we will find another route . " 
Bio NTech Chief Medical Officer Ozlem Tureci said the company was expecting a US FDA decision about emergency use of its vaccine mid December , as well as a decision by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) around the same date .
