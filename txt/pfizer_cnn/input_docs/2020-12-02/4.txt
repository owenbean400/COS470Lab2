A Covid 19 vaccine produced and developed by Bio NTech and Pfizer " meets rigorous high standards for safety , " the UK 's Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) has said . 
Professor Munir Pirmohamed , chair of the COVID 19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group of the Commission on Human Medicines , said any side effects of the vaccine during trials were " very mild " and only lasted a day or so . 
He explained the vaccine will be effective seven days after the second dose has been administered . 
But some protection starts to kick in after about 12 days . 
" Good news , we have a vaccine that is safe and effective , " Professor Wei Shen Lim , chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ( JCVI ) , an independent expert advisory group , added . 
The first doses will go to those most at risk of dying from the virus , such as care home residents , and health care professionals .
