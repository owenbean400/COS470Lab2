Tens of thousands of people in the UK will begin receiving the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine starting next week , after the UK became the first western country to authorize use of a coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday , the UK ’s Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) said . 
The initial rollout of the vaccine – comprised of two doses taken three weeks apart – will prioritize care home residents and staff , people over 80 and health and care workers , DCHS said in a press release . 
Up to 800,000 doses of the vaccine , which is enough to inoculate 400,000 people , are being made available next week . 
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses , " enough to vaccinate up to a third of the population , and the majority of doses are anticipated in the first half of next year , " the statement said . 
Here 's how the distribution process will work : Pfizer will dispatch the vaccine from Belgium to the UK . 
This is followed by a post delivery quality assurance process to ensure the vaccine ’s quality and integrity has been maintained . 
Once all checks are complete the vaccine will be made available to order by authorized sites in the National Health Service ( NHS ) . 
Orders will be packed and shipped as appropriate for the required storage temperature of each vaccine . 
Generally vaccines will be delivered on a next day delivery schedule except for more remote parts of the UK where delivery may take 48 hours . 
Delivering the Pfizer Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine is complex because it needs to be stored at very cold temperatures and moved carefully , so it will only be able to be delivered from " Hospital Hubs " at first . 
Defrosting the vaccine takes a few hours and then additional time is required to prepare the vaccine for administering . 
Stage one of the phased rollout of the vaccine will begin after it has been distributed .
