A Covid 19 vaccine for specific groups will likely be available by the end of December , Marc Lipsitch , a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health , predicted Wednesday . 
Other health experts , including Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , have also said they believe a coronavirus shot could be available for the most vulnerable populations , including health care workers , the elderly and those with underlying health conditions , by the end of the year . 
There are 10 vaccines in late stage clinical trials : Lipsitch believes the vaccine that has the best chances of crossing the finish line first is the one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer with its partner Bio NTech . 
" So , the trials we ’ve been hearing about , probably the two most prominent things we ’ve been hearing a lot about are the two messenger RNA vaccines , " Lipsitch said . 
" This is a new technology that 's being used that ’s being applied by both the company Moderna and the company Pfizer , " he said . 
" Those are both well into their Phase 3 trials and it looks like probably the Pfizer one would be the first to give an early answer about preliminary estimates of how well it works . " 
Currently there are 10 Covid 19 vaccine candidates in late stage , large clinical trials around the world .
