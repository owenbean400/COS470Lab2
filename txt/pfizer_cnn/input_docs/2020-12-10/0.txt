Cleveland Clinic in Ohio built a " freezer farm " of 16 ultra cold freezers to store Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s Covid 19 vaccine . 
The freezers are on Cleveland Clinic ’s main campus , Andrea Pacetti , a Cleveland Clinic spokesperson , told CNN Wednesday . 
Pacetti said the state of Ohio has told Cleveland Clinic its first shipment will contain a limited number of doses . 
Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s vaccine can be stored in refrigerators for up to five days after being removed from ultra cold freezers and up to six hours after being diluted with saline . 
" It 's a dance as far as getting it out of the freezer all the way to getting it to somebody who will be getting it in their arm , " said Dr . Michelle Medina , associate chief of clinical operations at Cleveland Clinic . 
" It has to be a very well timed dance . "
