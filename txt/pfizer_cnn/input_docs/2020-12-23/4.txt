When asked about the Trump administration 's deal to purchase an additional 100 million doses of Covid 19 from Pfizer , Dr . Rochelle Walensky , incoming director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said this is a " good thing , " but more money will be needed to get the country vaccinated . 
" I certainly think more vaccine is better than less vaccine … but we ca not let up on the measures that we have right now , " Walensky told CNN 's John Berman Wednesday . 
Walensky said money for vaccine distribution in the coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress this week is just a " just a down payment " for what ’s actually needed . 
Remember : Congress voted Monday evening to approve a far reaching $ 900 billion Covid relief package that promises to accelerate vaccine distribution and deliver much needed aid to small businesses hit hard by the pandemic , Americans who have lost their jobs during the economic upheaval and health care workers on the front lines of the crisis .
