Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said the UK should aim to vaccinate millions in January and February as part of a " radically accelerated " program . 
Writing in the Independent newspaper , the premier for ten years between 1997 and 2007 said the government should consider giving " as many people as possible " a single dose of the Pfizer/Bio NTech and Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccines , both of which need to be administered via two shots a few weeks apart . 
" We should continue to prioritise frontline health staff and the most vulnerable , but let this not hold up vaccinating others , " he wrote."The aim should be to vaccinate as many people as possible in the coming months . " 
Pfizer 's vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart to reach 95 % efficacy . 
Astra Zeneca 's has not been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency yet , and has 70 % efficacy on average . 
" As it is now , much of the country will not be vaccinated until spring or summer . 
The economic and health damage , physical and mental , caused by such a timetable will be colossal , " he wrote . 
Blair also told Britons to prepare for " a form of health passport " , adding that it will be the " only way the world will function . " 
Downing Street declined to comment .
