Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla , who has enthusiastically promised to know by the end of this month whether the company ’s coronavirus vaccine will work , tried to distance himself and his company from politics Thursday . 
" The amplified political rhetoric around vaccine development , timing and political credit is undercutting public confidence , " Bourla said in a letter to Pfizer employees posted online Thursday . 
He said the debate this week between US President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden made the issue too overtly political . 
" Once more , I was disappointed that the prevention for a deadly disease was discussed in political terms rather than scientific facts . 
People , who are understandably confused , do not know whom or what to believe , " Bourla wrote in the letter . 
Bourla said Pfizer was racing to make a vaccine for the good of the world . 
Bourla added : " We would never succumb to political pressure . " 
" I ca not predict exactly when , or even if our vaccine will be approved by the FDA for distribution to the public . 
But I do know that the world will be safer if we stop talking about the vaccines ’ delivery in political terms and focus instead on a rigorous independent scientific evaluation and a robust independent approval process . " 
Trump has claimed a vaccine could be ready before Election Day on November 3 . 
Most vaccine manufacturers and public health experts , including Trump ’s own advisers , have said that ’s unlikely . 
But Bourla has repeatedly promised his company will know whether its vaccine protects people from coronavirus by the end of October .
