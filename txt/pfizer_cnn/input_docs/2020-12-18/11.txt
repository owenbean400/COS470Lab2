Colorado Gov . 
Jared Polis said Covid 19 numbers remain high overall and has called for continued action to prevent the spread of the virus . 
Polis announced 3,693 new cases of Covid 19 , saying the positivity rate continues to show improvement at 7.19 % but the goal is to get it below 5 % . 
During a news conference today , Polis said Colorado received its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday and is expecting its first shipment of the Moderna vaccine next week . 
Polis said with the good news of additional shipments of vaccine , there is also bad news . 
According to Polis , the number of doses Colorado will receive from Pfizer will be lower next week because of Pfizer 's announcement that the federal government needs to tell them where to ship the vaccine . 
The governor said that health officials have notified him that starting today , the Pfizer vaccine will have six doses instead of five , increasing the number of vaccines by 20 % . 
" We are comfortable moving forward with the assumption that six doses is the norm per vial and so the numbers that the state reports on Pfizer vaccine will show a different number than what the CDC says they are sending us , " Polis said .
