Researchers at Oxford University say the coronavirus vaccine they developed with Astra Zeneca works best as a two shot sequence , just as Moderna ’s and Pfizer ’s vaccines do . 
In a separate study , they found the vaccine , which is in advanced clinical trials , produces a broad immune response that doctors hope could provide strong immune protection against infection . 
In one study , the researchers checked to make sure two doses were really necessary , and if so , both had to be two full doses . 
Half dose or full dose : The study was conducted before Astra Zeneca released confusing data that indicated giving a half dose as the first shot might provide better protection . 
It was a small group of volunteers who got the half dose and Astra Zeneca has indicated the dosing was a mistake , so this study does not shed light on those findings . 
How it differs from other vaccines : The Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine is different from the Pfizer vaccine now being rolled out in the US and Britain , and the similar Moderna vaccine being considered by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
Those vaccines use genetic material known as messenger RNA . 
The Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine uses an adenovirus -- a common virus that causes cold like symptoms -- that has been genetically altered to carry a gene for a coronavirus protein that trains the immune system to recognize the invader .
