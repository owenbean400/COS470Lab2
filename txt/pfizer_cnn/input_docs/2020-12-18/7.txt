Noubar Afeyan , the co founder and chairman of drug maker Moderna , says that the technology used to make the company 's Covid 19 vaccine could change the way scientists think about therapeutics and vaccines for other diseases in the future . 
Moderna is one of the companies to pioneer m RNA technology its vaccine is based on . 
Pfizer 's Covid 19 vaccine also uses this approach . 
How it works : Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can " read " and use to make a protein . 
In the case of this vaccine , the m RNA instructs cells in the body to make the particular piece of the virus 's spike protein . 
Then the immune system sees it , recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs . 
" We wanted to do the work to enable such a molecule to become a medicine , " Afeyan said . 
" The difference is if you 're dealing with an information molecule , a code molecule , by changing the code you ought to be able to make any therapeutic or vaccine you want , that was the dream . " 
He says this technology will change people 's perception of how long it should take to make a vaccine , adding that the " Covid 19 vaccine example will forge a new path . " 
" Perhaps not to always be able to go from zero to a vaccine in less than a year , but certainly the five to ten years it used to take was somewhat predicated on older technology and also , I 'll say , the assumption that it has to take that long , which we no longer have to make , " he said . 
Some context : The FDA 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee met to discuss Moderna 's vaccine on Thursday , and is expected to authorize it for emergency use in the coming days . 
Once it does , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says the federal government has nearly 5.9 million doses ready to be shipped .
