Two members of the US Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee voted in favor of recommending an emergency use authorization for Moderna ’s Covid 19 vaccine because they said the safety data was compelling . 
" I voted yes because the data that was presented to us was very strong , the efficacy was consistent across all the age groups , " FDA advisory committee member Dr . James Hildreth , also the president and CEO of Meharry Medical College , told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer Thursday . 
" They included people with chronic conditions , which is really important , " Hildreth said . 
" They also have data on people over 65 . " 
Fellow advisory committee member , Dr . Hayley Gans agreed . 
" I think this is a very exciting moment , " said Gans , a pediatric disease specialist at Stanford Health Care . 
" The data that was presented to us was striking in its efficacy , " Gans said . 
" This was a fairly large study and the safety was mostly in the mild , moderate , and that really compelled us to make this positive vote , " she said . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to meet on Saturday to recommend who should get the shot and distribution of the vaccine could begin Monday , similar to the way the process worked for the Pfizer vaccine last week .
