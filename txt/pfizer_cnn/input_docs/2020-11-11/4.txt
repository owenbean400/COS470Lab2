Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla filed to sell millions of dollars of his company 's stock Monday -- the day the pharmaceutical giant announced positive data about its coronavirus vaccine . 
The company 's shares soared after Pfizer and German lab Bio NTech said early data suggests the vaccine could be more than 90 % effective . 
The transaction was part of a regularly scheduled plan set up by Bourla to periodically sell some of his Pfizer shares . 
Bourla sold 132,508 Pfizer shares at a price of $ 41.94 , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . 
That works out to proceeds of nearly $ 5.6 million . 
A Pfizer spokeswoman said in an email to CNN Business that the sale took place because Pfizer shares hit a predetermined price as part of a plan authorized by Bourla on August 19 . 
When asked if Pfizer and Bourla thought to cancel the stock sale due to the perception that Bourla might be cashing in on good news , the spokeswoman said that " these are predetermined plans managed through a third party stock administrator . " 
Many executives sell stock at predetermined intervals to diversify their portfolios . 
But they can delay the sales to avoid appearances of capitalizing on one off events that can boost company 's shares . 
Bourla told CNN 's Sanjay Gupta that he learned of the trial 's results Sunday , a day before they were made public . 
Shares of Pfizer surged nearly 8 % Monday and were flat Tuesday . 
Bio NTech 's stock has rallied even more sharply , rising 15 % Monday and another 8 % Tuesday . 
Pfizer 's stock fell 1 % Wednesday .
