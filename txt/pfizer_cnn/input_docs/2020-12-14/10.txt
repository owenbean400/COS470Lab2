Beaumont Health 's Dr . Nicholas Gilpin will be the first person at his Michigan hospital to get the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon . 
" I 'm an infectious disease doctor , and I 'm taking care of a lot of Covid patients , so I have sort of a front line caregiver role , " he told CNN . 
" I 'm fortunate to be looked at by our health care providers as a leader . 
I think , as a leader , my job is to be a good ambassador for the vaccine and show our front line staff that it is safe , and it is effective . " 
He added : While Gilpin says he will be on a mission to advocate for the vaccine , he does not expect a lot to change in the short term .
