Pulmonary and critical care specialist Dr . Stella Ogake received her Covid 19 vaccine at the OSU Wexner Medical Center in Ohio this morning . 
" When I saw the truck coming out of the Pfizer manufacturing plant yesterday , I was so emotional just thinking about all the work that we had to put in to get here , " she added . 
Getting the vaccine alleviates her fear of getting the virus or taking it home to her family , she said , adding she wants this moment for other Americans too . 
" Just seeing patients in the hospital and seeing what they go through , my biggest fear is getting it myself or taking it home to my son or my husband , or my other family members . 
And for them to get as sick as the people I take care of , that 's definitely my biggest fear , " she said Monday . 
Right after taking the vaccine , she said she was feeling good and it was not painful .
