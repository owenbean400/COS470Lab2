Canada ’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of the Pfizer vaccine arriving in Canada on Sunday evening . 
" The first batch of doses of Pfizer Bio NTech ’s Covid 19 vaccine have arrived in Canada , " the tweet said , along with a photo of an airplane sitting on the runway . 
The vaccines come as the country struggles to get its infections under control . 
Several provinces -- including Quebec and Ontario , Canada 's two biggest -- said last week they were facing a rise in numbers , despite new restrictions and lockdowns . 
" I know we ’re all tired , but we need to make an effort , " said Dr . Mylène Drouin , Montreal ’s public health director , during a news conference Thursday .
