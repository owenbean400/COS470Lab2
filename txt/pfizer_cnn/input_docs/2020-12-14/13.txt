Chicago will receive and store vaccines at undisclosed locations . 
" Officials here have said that 's for security reasons , " CNN 's Omar Jimenez reported . 
" Though when it gets time for that first dose to happen , we do expect , based on conversations we 've had with health officials , that there will be some sort of access to show what that process is like . " 
What 's also different for Chicago is that the city will be the single entity to receive shipments of the Covid 19 vaccine from Pfizer and it will distribute the batches to hospitals in the area . 
Since not all hospitals have the capacity to store the vaccine at the - 70 Celsius temperature that the vaccine requires , the city department will store some for them . 
Officials expect more than 20,000 doses for the city in the first round .
