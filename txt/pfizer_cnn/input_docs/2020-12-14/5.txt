The United States is currently negotiating an additional order of 100 million doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine , Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta . 
This is Bourla 's first interview since his company 's vaccine was authorized for emergency use in the United States . 
" We can provide them -- the additional 100 million doses -- but right now , most of that we can provide in the third quarter . 
The US government wants them in the second quarter , " Bourla said . 
" We are working very collaboratively with them to make sure that we can find ways to produce more or allocate the doses in their second quarter as well , but we have not signed this agreement yet . " 
Bourla said he was " not at all " concerned the quality of the vaccine will diminish as manufacturing ramps up , because the firms have strict " high standards of quality . " 
" The 1.3 billion that we believe we will provide , they will definitely meet the highest standards of quality , " Bourla said of doses expected in 2021 . 
" Already we know how to do it and although it looks like a giant step , for us it 's what we do every day . 
So right now , I feel quite comfortable that we will be able to do it smoothly . "
