Kentucky Gov . 
Andy Beshear greeted a UPS truck delivering the first shipment of Pfizer 's vaccine to the University of Louisville Hospital this morning . 
During a news conference , a visibly emotional Beshear said the vaccine is " nothing short of a modern , medical miracle " as he watched five health care workers receive the vaccine . 
Dr . Jason Smith , the hospital 's chief medical officer , was among the first people in Kentucky to receive the vaccine . 
Beshear announced more than 12,500 initial doses of the two stage Pfizer vaccine are being distributed to 11 regional hospitals that will receive them within the next three days . 
According to the governor , more than 25,000 doses are going to CVS and Walgreens , which has a federal contract to vaccinate residents at long term care facilities . 
" We have to focus on our long term care residents first for the moral side , they make up 66 % of the deaths here in the Commonwealth . 
Just think about it , our goal is in the next two months to vaccinate all of them , meaning we can deal this virus a deadly blow while we are pushing towards victory , " added Beshear . 
He said he hopes the first allotment of the Moderna vaccine will be shipped this week and available to hospitals by early next week .
