Delaware received doses of the Pfizer Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine , Gov . 
John Carney announced on Facebook . 
The governor went to say that the " the vaccine ’s arrival does not mean we are in the clear . " 
" In fact , now more than ever , we need to step up our efforts to keep each other safe . 
That means wear a mask , wash your hands , and do not gather with your friends and family outside of your household . 
We know that ’s hard , particularly at this time of year , but we are almost through this . 
We just need to stand firm in our resolve to beat the virus , " Carney said .
