When asked when he would get vaccinated , Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said he does not want to be an example of someone " cutting the line , " but said " the sooner I can , I will . " 
" I 'm 59 years old , in good health , I 'm not working in the front line . 
So , my type is not recommended to get vaccinated , " Bourla told CNBC 's Meg Tirrell on Monday . 
However , Bourla stated that they are still considering the possibility for him to get vaccinated sooner than anticipated to demonstrate the safety of the vaccine to the public , and to encourage people to get vaccinated . 
" On the other hand , our company ran a lot of polls to see what would take people to believe it , and one of the highest ranking , even higher than if Joe Biden takes it , even higher than if the other President takes it , it is if the CEO of the company takes it , " Bourla said . 
" So , with that in mind , I 'm trying to find a way that I would get vaccinated despite that it 's not my time , just to demonstrate the confidence of the company . " 
Additionally , Bourla said that if he does end up taking the vaccine earlier , it will not give other Pfizer executives access to the vaccine .
