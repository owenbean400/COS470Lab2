The state of Alaska received its first shipment of Covid 19 vaccine Sunday night , according to an announcement from the Department of Health and Social Services . 
The vaccine supply created by Pfizer and Bio NTech was flown to the state by UPS . 
Alaska is the first state outside the contiguous United States to confirm receiving a shipment . 
The DHSS says it will take until Wednesday before vaccines arrive in some locations that have ordered them . 
" Following receipt of the first shipments , some health care workers could begin receiving vaccinations either later that day or soon thereafter at hospitals and health care facilities , " the department said in its press release Monday . 
In addition to the health care facilities that have directly ordered a vaccine supply , the state is working with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium to get doses to Alaska â€™s substantial number of remote indigenous communities .
