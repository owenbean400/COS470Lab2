Oklahoma received its first delivery of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine today and it is now being distributed to health care workers on the front lines , Oklahoma Gov . 
Kevin Stitt announced during a press conference . 
The initial delivery to Oklahoma includes 33,000 doses and the state is expecting a total of around 166,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by end of month , Oklahoma State Commissioner of Health Dr . Lance Frye said . 
Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt , who joined this afternoon ’s press conference , cautioned against irrational exuberance over today ’s vaccine arrival , saying " just because you saw a nurse receive the vaccine on television , does not mean that you have magically received the vaccine . " 
Oklahoma City is currently averaging almost 1,000 cases a day and has been averaging about 600 Covid 19 patients in the hospital , the Mayor said . 
" What you ’re seeing today is absolutely an encouraging glimpse of our future , but for most of us , it is not our present . 
So please , resolve to maintain and even enhance your precautions , recognizing that there is an end date now , " Mayor Holt said .
