The first shipment of Pfizer vaccines are being shipped to five New York City hospitals , the New York City Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi announced in a Monday news conference . 
" Beyond the logistics , let me just take a moment to acknowledge what a remarkable and poignant milestone in our fight against Covid 19 , " he added . 
Subsequent shipments are expected at 37 hospitals on Tuesday and 2 more on Wednesday , he said . 
All of the shipments are being transported by truck or plane . 
After the initial vaccinations , the data will be reported to the city 's immunization registry within 24 hours , according to Chokshi . 
Chokshi did not immediately detail the five hospitals , though earlier in the day the first vaccines in the state were administered at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Queens .
