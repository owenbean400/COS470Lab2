Astra Zeneca has promised to supply hundreds of millions of doses of its Covid 19 vaccine to low and middle income countries , and to deliver it on a not for profit basis to those nations in perpetuity . 
The vaccine , developed at England 's Oxford University , was approved for use by UK regulators on Wednesday -- the first country to do so . 
It is significantly cheaper than other coronavirus vaccines and , crucially , it would be far easier to transport and distribute in developing countries than its rivals since it does not need to be stored at freezing temperatures . 
The Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine can be kept at refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius ( 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit ) for at least six months . 
Moderna 's vaccine has to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius ( minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit ) -- or at refrigerator temperatures for up to 30 days -- and the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine has to be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius ( minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit ) , and used within five days once refrigerated at higher temperatures . 
" Pfizer and Moderna require freezer storage , and that just is not in place in many settings , " Ghani said . 
" Cold chain " refrigeration is the standard storage used globally to deliver vaccines from central locations to local health clinics . 
Astra Zeneca 's vaccine is so far " the only one that can definitely be delivered to those systems , " Ghani added . 
The vaccines are based on different technology . 
Astra Zeneca 's offering -- like Johnson & Johnson 's vaccine and Russia 's Sputnik V -- uses an adenovirus to carry genetic fragments of coronavirus into the body .
