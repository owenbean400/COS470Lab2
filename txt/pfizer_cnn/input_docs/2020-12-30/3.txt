More than 14 million Covid 19 vaccine doses have been distributed in the United States , Gen . Gustave Perna , chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed , said Wednesday . 
Perna did not say how many of those doses have been administered . 
The vaccine distribution process , he said , has entered a good cadence . 
" This week we provided jurisdictions with the final allocations of doses available , " Perna said . 
" That means by tomorrow night , all the jurisdictions will be able to place orders for up to 20 million doses of vaccine , which has been collective over the last two weeks plus . " 
Perna said the US is working to get people their second doses soon . 
" This week we started not only pushing first dose vaccine , but we started pushing second dose vaccine for the Pfizer vaccine , " he said .
