Johnson & Johnson ’s Covid 19 vaccine may be authorized for emergency use in February and could be a " game changer " for the US , Moncef Slaoui , chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed ( OWS ) , said Wednesday . 
Slaoui said Phase 3 trial recruitment for the vaccine has been completed . 
Slaoui said OWS is working with Johnson & Johnson to accelerate the availability of its vaccine doses . 
The vaccine requires a single dose , which may make the logistics around its distribution and administration easier . 
" I think it can be quite a game changer , " Slaoui said . 
" We 're hopeful that this vaccine , which is a one shot vaccine will have equivalent efficacy to those of Moderna and Pfizer . " 
Moderna and Pfizer/Bio NTech ’s vaccines both require two doses and have more than 94 % efficacy .
