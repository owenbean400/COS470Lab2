A German company working with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has begun human trials of a potential Covid 19 vaccine that could supply millions by the end of the year , according to the two firms . 
Pfizer says it will begin testing the experimental vaccine in the United States as early as next week , and says a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in the fall , the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday . 
Mainz based Bio NTech reported that the first cohort of participants had been given doses of the potential vaccine , BNT162 , in a Phase 1/2 clinical study in Germany . 
No information on the results is currently available . 
Bio NTech said around 200 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years old would be given doses ranging from 1µg ( microgram ) to 100µg to find the optimal dose for further studies . 
" In addition , the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be investigated , " added the biotech company . 
Pfizer and Bio NTech plan to initiate trials for BNT162 in the US upon regulatory approval , expected shortly , the statement said . 
The German Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Drugs approved the trial -- the country 's first clinical trial for a vaccine against Covid 19 -- on April 22 . 
" The two companies plan to jointly conduct clinical trials for the COVID 19 vaccine candidates initially in Europe and the U.S . , across multiple research sites , " Pfizer announced in its first quarter report , published online Tuesday . 
Pfizer is not the only group with a potential Covid 19 vaccine in the works . 
Last week , scientists at Oxford University 's Jenner Institute in the United Kingdom began testing its vaccine on humans Thursday and , depending on the trial results , could be ready as early as September . 
Officials say that more than a half dozen vaccine programs are in the clinical trial phase and more than 80 are in preliminary phases .
