Biotech company Novavax -- which announced the launch of a phase 3 trial of its Covid 19 vaccine in the US on Monday -- confirmed it is also testing its vaccine against the UK strain of coronavirus that appears to transmit more easily . 
This will involve taking blood from trial participants who received the vaccine and checking to see if their antibodies neutralize the UK strain in the lab . 
Novavax joins other pharmaceutical companies , including Pfizer and Moderna , that are also testing their vaccines against this strain -- which has become widespread in the United Kingdom and has appeared in many other countries . 
The variant appears to be more transmissible , but there â€™s no indication it causes more severe disease . 
The statement noted there have been other coronavirus variants , and the company believes its vaccine will create an " immune response that covers these sequence variants and will be protective . "
