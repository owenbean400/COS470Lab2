The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday issued an updated authorization letter and healthcare provider fact sheet on appropriate dosing of the Pfizer/Bio NTech coronavirus vaccine . 
The agency said the updates are " consistent with previous FDA advice that it would be acceptable to use every full dose obtainable ( the sixth , or possibly even a seventh ) from each vial " until scientists can resolve the issue . 
Almost two weeks ago , when the first Pfizer vaccines rolled out , some providers realized there was an extra dose or two in the vaccine vials that were supposed to contain only five shots . 
The FDA said at the time it was fine to squeeze an extra shot or two out of the vials . 
What 's in the fact sheet ? 
The fact sheet for healthcare providers is a summary of the instructions for administering a Covid 19 vaccine on how to store , thaw , prepare and administer the vaccine . 
The fact sheet includes a reminder to providers enrolled in the federal Covid 19 Vaccination Program to report all administration errors , serious adverse events , cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome ( MIS ) in adults and children , and cases of coronavirus that result in hospitalizations or death following a Pfizer/Bio NTech shot . 
The instructions contain a warning against giving the Pfizer vaccine to people with a history of severe allergic reactions . 
The agency said treatment used to manage severe allergic reactions must be immediately available onsite in case of an anaphylactic reaction . 
The agency also warned against mixing the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines , specifying that an initial Pfizer shot should be followed up with another Pfizer shot three weeks later , and the same for the Moderna vaccine .
