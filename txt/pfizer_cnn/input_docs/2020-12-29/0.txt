The US needs to ramp up its Covid 19 vaccination effort , Dr . Ashish Jha , dean of the Brown University School of Public Health , said Monday . 
" You 're hearing from the manufacturers , like Pfizer , saying they 've got millions of doses sitting around waiting for those vaccine doses to be allocated , " he added . 
Jha noted that other countries , like Israel and Canada , are moving at a much faster pace on their own vaccination efforts . 
" We really do have to ramp this up , " he said .
