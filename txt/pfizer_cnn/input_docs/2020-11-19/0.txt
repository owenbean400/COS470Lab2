A final analysis of the Phase 3 trial of Pfizer 's coronavirus vaccine shows it was 95 % effective in preventing infections , even in older adults , and caused no serious safety concerns , the company said Wednesday . 
The company counted 170 cases of coronavirus infection among volunteers who took part in the trial . 
It said 162 infections were in people who got placebo , or plain saline shots , while eight cases were in participants who got the actual vaccine . 
That works out to an efficacy of 95 % , Pfizer said . 
The data show Pfizer 's initial claim of a better than 90 % efficacy -- a claim that stunned and pleased health officials and vaccine developers last week -- holds up . 
An independent group has been keeping an eye on results and side effects . 
" To date , the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine , " the companies said . 
" The only Grade 3 ( severe ) solicited adverse event greater than or equal to 2 % in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.7 % following dose 2 , " the companies said . 
Older adults tended to have fewer adverse events and those they had were milder .
