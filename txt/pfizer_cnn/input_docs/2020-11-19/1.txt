The United States may see a " graded rollout " of vaccines in the coming months , Dr . Anthony Fauci told the USA Today editorial board Wednesday . 
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines , which both require two doses , " will be going into people sometime towards the end of December 2020 and into January 2021 , " said Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
He said people can expect to have " good degree of immunity " about one week after receiving the second dose . 
Fauci said that potentially by late January or February , " some of the other candidates will be available , like the Janssen one or the Astra Zeneca one . " 
The Sanofi and Novavax vaccine candidates may be available " a couple months later , " he added .
