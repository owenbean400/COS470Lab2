Florida is trying to determine what additional shipments of the Pfizer Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine will be delivered this month , said Gov . 
Ron De Santis , since shipments for the next two weeks are " on hold right now . " 
Speaking at a news conference Tuesday , the governor said he did not know if Florida would be receiving shipments or not , saying that the root of the delay is " a production issue with Pfizer . " 
He added that it " has nothing to do with the federal government , or nothing to do specifically with Florida . " 
De Santis said the state sent vaccines to five select hospitals so that mistakes would not be exacerbated and to " get everything on target the first time . " 
The governor said hospitals beyond those initial five will start vaccinating their staff this week " without a problem . " 
The governor said he expects Covid 19 mortality will " crater " as vaccines start being administered to those most at risk for Covid 19 . 
De Santis went on to urge the state to focus on efforts mitigating the risk to more " vulnerable people , " but said imposing mandates is not an option for him .
