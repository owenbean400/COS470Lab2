For those confused or concerned about how the coronavirus vaccine actually works , here 's one medical expert 's explanation : it 's like Snapchat . 
Both Pfizer Bio NTech and Moderna use m RNA ( messenger RNA ) for their vaccines . 
The Pfizer vaccine began distribution in the United States on Monday . 
Unlike most vaccines , the m RNA vaccines do not contain a live virus , meaning they do not carry a risk of causing disease in the vaccinated person . 
The m RNA technology has been studied for about a decade . 
Scientist Katali Karikó , senior vice president of Bio NTech and a pioneer in m RNA vaccine technology , said she knew the technology would work for the new vaccines . 
She is receiving her vaccination later this week . 
" I expected that it would work because we already had the experiments , " Karikó told CNN . 
" I was confident that it would work . " 
" Now we are very excited it became a vaccine , part of this vaccine for both companies , and really we will celebrate when this human suffering is over . "
