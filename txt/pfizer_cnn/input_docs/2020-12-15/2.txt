US Surgeon General Dr . Jerome Adams said Monday he is worried about vaccine skepticism among minority communities , but is working to help overcome it . 
" Nothing has been in my heart more than this issue over the past several weeks to months , " Adams told CNN . 
" I ’ve been working with Pfizer , with Moderna , with Astra Zeneca , with Johnson & Johnson to make sure we have appropriate numbers of minorities enrolled in these vaccine trials so that people can understand that they are safe . " 
Adams said he ’s working with leaders in the minority community , including faith leaders and fraternities and sororities . 
Adams said he ’s heartened to see the numbers increasing among Americans who say they ’ll get the vaccine when it becomes available . 
That figure is close to 80 % today , a sharp rise from just 30 % four weeks ago . History behind mistrust : Adams emphasized that there are now independent review boards and regulations to protect against incidents like the Tuskegee experiment . 
Between 1932 and 1972 , Black men in the Tuskegee syphilis study were deliberately left untreated so doctors could study the " natural course " of the disease , which can damage the organs as it progresses , including the brain , other nerves , eyes and heart .
