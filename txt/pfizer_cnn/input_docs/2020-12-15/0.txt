US Surgeon General Jerome Adams called the rollout Monday of the nation ’s first Covid 19 vaccine " tremendous . " 
" Today we really did get a shot of hope , " he added . 
Adams was at George Washington University Medical Center Monday as frontline health care workers got the vaccination . 
" We ’re not talking about development . 
We 're not talking about the approval process -- actual vaccines going into arms , " Adams said . 
But he cautioned that there ’s still a long road ahead : " We 've got a long way to go , make no mistake about it , and we still need to be appropriately cautious , " Adams said . 
" We still need to understand how severe this virus is and the surge that is going in the wrong direction , but we 've got some hope finally , " he added . 
All 50 states , Washington , DC and Puerto Rico have now received their first shipments of the Pfizer vaccine , according to statements from the state departments of health , governor ’s offices and local hospitals .
