Operation Warp Speed ’s Gen . Gustave Perna told governors today that another 4.3 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine would be authorized for release this Friday , according to a source familiar with the call . 
Dr . Robert Redfield , the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , also suggested that there would be additional recommendations coming no later than Saturday on how to determine who should be in group 1b for vaccinations . 
As far as the spread in the US , Dr . Deborah Birx said there was " evidence of improvement " in the middle of the country , but warned that caseloads are rising on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts . 
Administration officials also appear to be grappling with how best to capitalize on monoclonal antibody treatments . 
Birx , Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar all encouraged governors to push the use of monoclonal antibodies early in treatment for coronavirus . 
Azar said it ’s " almost too late " to use monoclonal antibodies once a patient is already admitted to the hospital .
