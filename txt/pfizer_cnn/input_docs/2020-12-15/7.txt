German Health Minister Jens Spahn has called on the European Medicines Agency to approve the Pfizer Bio NTech coronavirus vaccine before Christmas . 
The German government is facing criticism because the Pfizer Bio NTech vaccine , developed in Germany , has already been granted emergency use authorizations in several countries -- but not in the European Union . 
" It is difficult to comprehend why the American regulatory authority , the FDA , can manage this in a much shorter time frame than the EMA . 
If there are further delays , the German government should evaluate whether a national authorization might become necessary , " the Association of German Hospitals wrote in a news release on Sunday . 
Germany is currently facing a major surge in infections , hospitalizations and deaths . 
The country has reported a total of more than 1.35 million cases and 22,600 virus related deaths , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
