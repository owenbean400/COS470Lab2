The first doses of a FDA authorized Covid 19 vaccine were injected into those at the frontlines of the pandemic on Monday , less than a year after the disease was first detected in the United States . 
All 50 states — as well as Washington , DC and Puerto Rico — received their first shipment of the Pfizer Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine , according to statements from the state departments of health , governor ’s offices , and local hospitals . 
Operation Warp Speed , a public private effort , developed the Pfizer vaccine in less than a year , an astonishing feat since most vaccines take years to develop . 
Now , the challenge is getting the vaccine to the hospitals and clinics for inoculations . 
" As we move into February , we hope to have not only the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines , but Johnson & Johnson single dose vaccine , Astra Zeneca , potentially , that will increase supply even more . " 
But it will be several months before most Americans can get a Covid 19 vaccine . 
Operation Warp Speed said roughly 145 sites would receive the vaccine on Monday with another 425 on Tuesday and the remaining 66 deliveries on Wednesday . 
Vaccine shipments began on Sunday morning when trucks departed Pfizer ’s massive manufacturing facility near Kalamazoo , Michigan .
