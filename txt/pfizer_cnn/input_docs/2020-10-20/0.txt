Moderna and Pfizer , the two frontrunners in the US race for a Covid 19 vaccine , will be making presentations to an all day meeting Thursday of a US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee , but both companies said they will not be presenting data from their Phase 3 clinical trials . 
" This is not a moment where we will be sharing data . 
This is a discussion from the FDA to discuss the requirements for efficacy , safety and manufacturing , " a spokesperson for Pfizer said in an email to CNN . 
Both companies have said they could possibly apply to the FDA for authorization to market their vaccines in the coming weeks if their Phase 3 clinical trial data turns out to be positive . 
Pfizer has said it could apply for emergency use authorization after the third week in November . 
Moderna has said the federal government could give an EUA to the company ’s experimental Covid 19 vaccine in December if the company gets positive interim results in November . 
Once the companies apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA , the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will advise the agency on whether it thinks authorization should be given . 
The Thursday meeting is scheduled from 10 a.m . to 5 p.m . , but Dr . Paul Offit , a member of the FDA ’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , said members have been asked to keep their schedules clear until 7 p.m . because it might run long . 
Offit , director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia , said " general parameters " will be discussed for how to measure vaccine safety and efficacy .
