The Covid 19 Prevention Network , a group formed by the US ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to respond to the global pandemic , will host its first event Thursday to encourage Black people to participate in vaccine trials . 
The network has already taken out a series of advertisements to encourage minority participation in the trial . 
Thursday 's event , called " COVID in Black , " is an interactive discussion where participants can communicate via Zoom and Facebook with Black doctors and experts . 
The online events are expected to be held monthly , according to Stephaun Wallace , director of external relations at the Covid 19 Prevention Network . 
Vaccine trials struggled to recruit minorities , including Black people . 
Minority participation in vaccine trials has improved in the past month , but it is still not as high as public health leaders would like . 
On Thursday the experts will share information about the current and planned clinical trials , not just to encourage Black enrolment , but also to encourage Black people to take the vaccine once it 's on the market . 
" Having conversations in communities about black folks ' engagement in medicine and medical establishments is really a part of this as well , " Wallace told CNN . 
Black enrolment remains low : Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of NIAID , has urged that at least 27 % of volunteers in vaccine clinical trials be Black , but enrolments are not reaching that level . 
Black participants made up 13 % of Moderna ’s new enrolments for the week of September 14 , according to the company . 
In Pfizer ’s US trial , 8 % of the volunteers are Black , according to the company . 
People can volunteer for coronavirus vaccine trials on the Covid 19 Prevention Network ’s website . 
Currently , 3 % of the 407,000 people who have registered on the site have been Black , according to a spokesperson for the network .
