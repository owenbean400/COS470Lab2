Moderna and Pfizer , the two major pharmaceutical companies developing coronavirus vaccines , are still not enrolling enough minorities in their clinical trials , according to their trial updates . 
The recommendation : Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN that Phase 3 clinical trials should aim to include minorities at levels that are at least double their representation in the population to better reflect the population most affected by Covid 19 . 
That would mean 37 % of the study participants would be Latino , and 27 % would be Black . 
The reality : As of this week , 16 % of Moderna ’s study subjects were Latino , and 10 % were Black . 
And as of August 31 , 11 % of Pfizer 's study subjects were Latino and 8 % were Black . 
That does not square with Fauci ’s recommendation to aim to enroll those minorities at levels at least double their numbers in the Census . 
Why this matters : Minority enrollment in the trials is important for two reasons : The vaccine might work differently in people of color than in White people , and those effects need to be studied . 
To find out if the vaccine works , a sufficient number of people need to get infected and sick with Covid 19 . 
That means researchers need to vaccinate enough high risk people – and Covid 19 has hit Blacks and Latinos particularly hard .
