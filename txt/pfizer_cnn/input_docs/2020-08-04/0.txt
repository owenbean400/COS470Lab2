The federal government may be buying up possible coronavirus vaccines ahead of time , but buying treatments such as drugs and antibodies is a different matter , a top official said Tuesday . 
Dr . Janet Woodcock , a Food and Drug Administration official who leads therapeutics development for Operation Warp Speed , said advanced purchasing of potential Covid 19 therapeutics is much different than the advanced purchase of vaccines . 
" The therapeutic landscape is much wider , " Woodcock told a media briefing , adding there are multiple different modalities of therapy . 
With vaccines " it 's very clear what you 're going to do , " Woodcock said . 
" The primary goal is to vaccinate people and protect them â€¦ with therapeutics it 's a little more complicated . " 
Woodcock said that advanced purchasing of therapeutics is going to be slower , because , " out of these vast inventories of potential candidates , we have to select the most promising ones . 
We ca not just buy advanced purchases of 600 different agents . " 
Remember : Operation Warp Speed , the federal government 's Covid 19 vaccine program , has contracts to buy hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines from several different companies , including Moderna , Astra Zeneca , Pfizer and others . 
If any are shown to work safely to protect people against coronavirus , the advanced purchases mean the vaccines could be rolled out immediately without a wait time for their manufacture .
