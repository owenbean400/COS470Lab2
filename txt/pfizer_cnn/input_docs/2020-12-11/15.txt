Pfizer and the US Food and Drug Administration are " negotiating " what information should be on the label for the company ’s coronavirus vaccine , considering two people in the UK had adverse reactions to the shots this week , according to the acting chairman of an FDA vaccine advisory committee . 
" They ’re going back and forth about what wording should be on the label – that ’s what ’s happening right now , " said Dr . Arnold Monto , acting chairman of the FDA ’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , which voted Thursday to recommend authorization of the vaccine . 
Monto also said the FDA and Pfizer are negotiating whether there should be special information on the label about 16 and 17 year olds , since relatively few people that age were included in Pfizer ’s clinical trials . 
" I think they ’re going to issue the authorization down to age 16 – that ’s pretty clear – but I do not know if they ’re going to require that the label say that the data for people that age is not as extensive , " said Monto , a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health . 
He said these and other issues are being discussed before the agency issues an emergency use authorization for the vaccine .
