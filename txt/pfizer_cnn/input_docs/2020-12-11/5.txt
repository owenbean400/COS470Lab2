" Just a little bit ago , the FDA informed Pfizer that they do intend to proceed towards an authorization for their vaccine , " US Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar told ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos on Friday . 
HHS confirmed to CNN that Azar was referencing a tweet posted on Friday morning , which links to a Friday US Food and Drug Administration news release from the FDA ’s Dr . Stephen Hahn and Dr . Peter Marks . 
Azar said that " in the next couple of days , probably , " as they work to negotiate with Pfizer and get information the doctors need to prescribe it appropriately , " we should be seeing the authorization of this first vaccine . " 
Azar said that they will work with Pfizer to get it shipped out and " so we could be seeing people get vaccinated Monday , Tuesday of next week . " 
" So , it ’s very close . 
It ’s really just the last dotting of I ’s and crossing of T ’s , " Azar added .
