The federal government plans to buy 100 million more doses of coronavirus vaccine from Moderna , the Health and Human Services Department said Friday . 
" The purchase announced today brings the total doses of m RNA 1273 owned by the federal government to 200 million . 
Moderna began manufacturing the first 100 million doses while clinical trials were getting underway , " HHS said in a statement . 
The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue emergency use authorization for Pfizer/Bio NTech ’s coronavirus vaccine at any moment , and the federal government has denied reports it turned down an opportunity to buy 100 million extra doses of Pfizer ’s vaccine last summer . 
Vaccine advisers to the FDA will meet next week to discuss an emergency use authorization for Moderna ’s vaccine . 
Both Moderna ’s and Pfizer ’s vaccines have been shown to be about 95 % effective in preventing symptomatic infections . 
Moderna ’s vaccine does not need to be kept as cold as Pfizer ’s does during shipment and storage .
