Most governors have informed Operation Warp Speed that they expect to exhaust their Pfizer vaccines within days of receiving the first shipment , according to a senior administration official . 
It â€™s unclear when the second shipment will arrive , although Warp Speed officials have said additional shipments will arrive on a weekly basis . 
Where the vaccine process stands : Vaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted Thursday to recommend the agency grant emergency use authorization to Pfizer and Bio NTech 's coronavirus vaccine . 
While the vote is an important step in the vaccine authorization and distribution process , the FDA still needs to issue an emergency use authorization , which will allow shipments to begin . 
Shots still ca not be administered until the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee recommends the vaccine . 
The final step in the process is for CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield to sign off on the committee recommendation .
