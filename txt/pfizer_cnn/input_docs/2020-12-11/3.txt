The US Food and Drug Administration is likely to recommend against giving pregnant women the upcoming Pfizer vaccine , a member of the FDA â€™s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee said Thursday . 
Dr . Paul Offit 's comments came after the committee voted to recommend the vaccine for an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) . . 
" Offit said this will also happen when the vaccine rolls out to health care workers and people in long term care facilities . 
Some of those vaccinated will invariably include pregnant women . 
The committee voted 17-4 , with one abstention , in favor of recommending the FDA grant Pfizer an EUA . 
The FDA will now decide whether to accept the recommendation but has signaled that it will issue the EUA for the vaccine .
