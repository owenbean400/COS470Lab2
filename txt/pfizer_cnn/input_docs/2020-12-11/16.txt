Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Moncef Slaoui is urging Americans to keep an " open mind " about the upcoming coronavirus vaccine . 
Slaoui said he is aware some Americans are worried about getting a new vaccine . 
As the government and Pfizer prepare to roll out a Covid 19 vaccine , there is concern about vaccine hesitancy among some Americans , including minority communities . 
Slaoui emphasized that the experts reviewing the data on the Pfizer vaccine have concluded that the shot has " exceptional efficacy " and an " excellent safety profile that is comparable to many approved vaccines . " 
More context : In terms of getting a stronger message out to hesitant Americans , Slaoui said experts had been unable to talk about the specifics of the data before the information was public . 
" Now that that is the case , we have to go out there and engage with all of the leadership at all levels in our communities to help explain the features of the vaccine , its performance , and hopefully engage with people and convince them , " Slaoui said . 
" Frankly , we could not do it effectively before because we could not be very specific . " 
The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer â€™s vaccine within days .
