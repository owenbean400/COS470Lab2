At 10 a.m . ET , the House Energy and Commerce committee will hold a hearing on a " Pathway to a Vaccine : Efforts to Develop a Safe , Effective and Accessible Covid 19 Vaccine . " 
Witnesses include officials from companies Astra Zeneca , Johnson & Johnson , Merck , Moderna and Pfizer which are developing Covid 19 vaccines . 
The World Health Organization says there are 23 vaccines already in clinical trials around the world . 
Why this matters : Results from trials involving three different coronavirus vaccines released Monday , all showed positive results , with evidence the vaccines can produce immune responses that would be expected to protect people against infection . 
They all also appeared to be safe , although it will take studies with more people to show how safe they really are and whether they can prevent infection . 
Early results of a closely watched Phase 1/2 trial published in The Lancet suggest a coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and Astra Zeneca is safe and induces an immune response . 
However , researchers stressed more study is needed to know whether the vaccine protects people against the virus .
