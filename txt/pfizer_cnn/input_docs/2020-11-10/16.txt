Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said he was concerned over the rise in Covid 19 cases heading into the holiday season , particularly in the southwest of the state . 
Northam said the state positivity rate was 6.2 % , with 1,435 new cases , while southwest Virginia was seeing 9 % of tests coming back positive . 
Northam said the state 's Department of Health was focusing a communications campaign in that region to emphasize the importance of avoiding indoor gatherings , washing hands and adhering to Virginia ’s face covering mandate . 
He announced that Virginia has signed contracts with three labs to participate in the state ’s new One Lab network -- a system that will allow the state to increase testing capacity by an extra 7,000 tests per day by the end of the year . 
Northam said the Pfizer vaccine was good news but " not a magic bullet . "
