Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said Tuesday that he hopes US President Trump is not planning to fire him . 
Trump recently suggested that he might fire Fauci after the election . 
Asked by MSNBC â€™s Andrea Mitchell whether he is concerned that the President may pressure the National Institutes of Health director to fire him , Fauci said , " I hope not . " 
He said that would not help with the common goal : " No matter who you are , regardless of what administration , we all want this pandemic to end . " 
He said he attended a " good meeting " of the White House coronavirus task force on Monday and was now " focusing like a laser beam on the job I have of ending this epidemic and really preserving the health and the welfare of the American public . " 
He said the Pfizer vaccine , along with continued public health measures , has the potential to end the pandemic . 
If the vaccine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use , Fauci said he believes doses will be available for " highest priority " people by December . 
He said he hoped that a vaccine will be given to everyone who wants and needs it " after a reasonable period of time . " 
Fauci said that " a vaccine that has this potential , this together with the continuation of the public health measures , really should get us out of this very difficult situation we 're into . " 
He said he trusted Pfizer and the FDA to make the right decision . 
Fauci said Eli Lilly 's antibody treatment was an " important first step in the development and distribution of interventions that are given early in the course of disease . " 
" We need more of those interventions that prevent people from going in the hospital , " Fauci added .
