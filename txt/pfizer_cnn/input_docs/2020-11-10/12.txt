Drug giant Pfizer sparked a stock market rally with its Monday announcement that its coronavirus vaccine is more than 90 % effective , based on early data . 
It also kicked off a battle over who deserves credit for the preliminary good news . 
US President Donald Trump 's administration was quick to applaud itself . 
Others , however , pointed to the fact that Pfizer 's senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development , Kathrin Jansen , publicly distanced the company from the Trump administration 's Operation Warp Speed vaccine initiative . 
Jansen was quoted Monday by The New York Times as saying : " We were never part of the Warp Speed . 
We have never taken any money from the US government , or from anyone . " 
The real story is more nuanced than both Pence 's tweet and Jansen 's comment made it sound . 
Facts First : Pfizer 's vaccine progress is certainly not solely attributable to the Trump administration 's Operation Warp Speed public private partnership program . 
But it was not accurate for Pfizer to suggest that it is operating entirely apart from Operation Warp Speed ; the company has a major agreement to sell at least 100 million doses to the federal government , and Pfizer acknowledged in a Monday statement to CNN that it is in fact " participating " in Operation Warp Speed through this deal . 
Also , at least some independent experts say the Trump administration deserves partial credit for Pfizer 's progress . 
But there 's more to the story .
