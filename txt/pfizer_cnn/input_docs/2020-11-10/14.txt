Britain has a " 70 to 80 % chance " of life getting back to normal by Easter if the UK does not " screw up " the distribution of a potential Covid 19 vaccine , Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University John Bell said Tuesday . 
Bell is a member of the government ’s vaccine taskforce . 
He appeared at a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday where he discussed Pfizer 's promising Covid 19 vaccine candidate . 
Pfizer said Monday that the vaccine had more than 90 % efficacy , based on early data . 
Bell said that Monday 's announcement by Pfizer was " a massive step forward " and that he 's optimistic of getting enough vaccinations done in the first quarter of 2021 . 
But he cautioned that obstacles to approving and distributing the vaccine remained . 
However , he said it signals that many of the other vaccines " that have the same immunogenicity are likely also to be efficacious so I would not be surprised if we hit the new year with two or three vaccines , all of which could be distributed . " 
" That 's why I 'm quite optimistic of getting enough vaccinations done in the first quarter of next year that by spring , things will start to look much more normal than they do now , " he added . 
The chair of parliament ’s Health Committee Jeremy Hunt tweeted that the UK could at least start feeling " more optimistic . " 
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Tuesday that the UK government does not yet know " whether or when the vaccine is approved , " but that it has asked the National Health Service ( NHS ) " to be ready from any date from the 1st of December . " 
" The logistics are complex , the uncertainties are real and the scale of the job is vast . 
But I know that NHS brilliantly assisted by the armed forces will be up to the task , " Hancock said during a Covid 19 statement in the House of Commons .
