" No corners were cut " in the development of Pfizer ’s 2 dose coronavirus vaccine , the company ’s vice president of research and development , Dr . John Burkhardt , said at a news conference in Connecticut Monday . 
Burkhardt said what ’s been unusual in the development of its Covid 19 vaccine is that the company started the manufacturing process at the same time it was developing the vaccine , something that is not usually done . 
" Normally you would not spend $ 1 billion to manufacture a product that may not work . 
You wait to see whether it works and whether it 's safe and then you do the manufacturing . 
So , we did that at risk , " he said . 
It was a decision made very early in the process to save time , Burkhardt said . 
He also credited " great volunteerism " in getting 43,000 people enrolled in the clinical trials as a time saver in the development process . 
Pfizer announced Monday that early efficacy data on its Covid 19 vaccine appears to be more than 90 % effective , much better than expected .
