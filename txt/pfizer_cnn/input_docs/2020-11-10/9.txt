State health officials in the US have told CNN that they are feeling " overwhelmed " and " daunted " at the prospect of distributing Pfizer 's Covid 19 vaccine , should it become widely available soon . 
On Monday , Pfizer announced that early data from its Phase 3 trial showed its vaccine was more than 90 % effective . 
The drug giant could apply for authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) as early as this month . 
The vaccine 's handling requirements are stringent — it has to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius ( minus 103 Fahrenheit ) , more than 50 degrees Celsius lower than any other vaccine currently on the market in the US . 
The required conditions are far colder than the temperatures in freezers kept in doctors ' offices , pharmacies and public health clinics . 
Molly Howell , who ’s in charge of the immunization program in North Dakota , said she felt " overwhelmed " and " daunted " while watching a webinar last month on how to distribute Pfizer ’s vaccine . 
" How are we going to do this ? " she texted a colleague who was also on the webinar . 
Her colleague responded with an exploding head emoji . 
Pfizer has offered " thermal shippers " about the size of a suitcase to keep the vaccine cold . 
They ’re only temporary , and need to be replenished with dry ice every five days . 
" It would be hard to with a straight face say , ‘ Oh , we 're all set , ’ " said Christine Finley , Vermont ’s immunization program manager . 
" [ This ] equals a challenge I do not think we ’ve ever seen before . "
