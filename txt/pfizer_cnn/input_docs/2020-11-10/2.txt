Almost half of the volunteers in Pfizer ’s Phase 3 clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine are from diverse backgrounds , the company ’s vice president of research and development , Dr . John Burkhardt , said at a news conference in Connecticut Monday . 
" Our approach has been to really enroll lots of patients , gain lots of diversity in that population , go into the places where we can enroll diversity and then to learn from that data as it plays out in the study , " Burkhardt said . 
Pfizer is studying 43,000 patients in its vaccine trials , he said , and 42 % are from ethnic and racial backgrounds that are considered diverse . 
It ’s unclear whether the vaccine may not benefit some populations or if there might be side effects associated with it . 
" We do not have the sub level of detail to answer those , but we believe we 've got the kind of clinical trial design and some simple data set that will be very informative , " he said . 
Pfizer announced Monday that early data on its Covid 19 vaccine shows it appears to be more than 90 % effective at preventing infection .
