A coronavirus vaccine , if successfully developed , will not be made mandatory in the United Kingdom , Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC News on Tuesday . 
Hancock 's comments come a day after the Prime Minister ’s spokesperson confirmed that 10 million doses of Pfizer ’s candidate vaccine would be manufactured and made available to the UK by the end of 2020 , if approved by regulators . 
The UK has procured 40 million doses of the candidate vaccine , the spokesperson said . 
When asked if children will need to be vaccinated , Hancock said that the vaccine " is not for children " as they have a " very low susceptibility " to the virus . 
In a separate interview with Sky News , Hancock added that those " most vulnerable " will be prioritized , such as those who live or work in care homes and healthcare workers . 
" The faster we can protect those who are most at risk , the easier it will be to be able to have confidence , to be able to take the steps that will allow life to get back to normal , " Hancock said .
