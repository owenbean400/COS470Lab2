A new collaboration has been announced in the world 's quest for a potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus . 
Biotechnology company Moderna and Switzerland based Lonza Ltd . said on Friday that they were agreeing to a 10 year collaboration to manufacture a potential Covid 19 vaccine , m RNA 1273 . 
Moderna ’s Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said in a news release on Friday that the collaboration would enable the firm to accelerate its manufacturing capacity for m RNA 1273 and other products by a factor of 10 . 
The release noted that under the terms of the agreement , the companies plan to establish manufacturing suites at Lonza ’s facilities in the United States and Switzerland for the manufacture of the potential vaccine . 
In April , Moderna submitted an Investigational New Drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration for Phase 2 and late stage studies of m RNA 1273 and the company expects to begin the study in the second quarter of 2020 , according to its news release . 
Moderna is not the only company with a potential Covid 19 vaccine in the works . 
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is collaborating with the biotechnology company Bio NTech to develop a vaccine , which the companies announced on Wednesday could be widely supplied by the end of the year . 
Last week , scientists at Oxford University 's Jenner Institute announced they would begin testing a vaccine on humans which , depending on the trial results , could be ready as early as September . 
Officials say that more than a half dozen vaccine programs are in the clinical trial phase and more than 80 are in preliminary phases .
