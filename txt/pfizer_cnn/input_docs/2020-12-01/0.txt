Up to 15 % of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trial participants have " quite noticeable side effects , " Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Dr . Moncef Slaoui said Monday . 
Operation Warp Speed is a public private partnership aimed at producing and delivering safe vaccines . 
Some vaccine trial volunteers have reported a range of flu like symptoms after receiving the shots , including nausea , body aches , headaches and chills . 
" I would classify them as maybe 10 , 15 % of subjects immunized have quite noticeable side effects that usually last no more than 24 , 36 hours and resolve , " he said . 
" Most people will have much less noticeable side effects that frankly , in comparison to a 95 % protection against an infection that can be deadly or significantly debilitating , I think , is , is an appropriate balance , " he added . 
Slaoui said any possible long term side effects of the vaccines would be more important . 
Both Pfizer and Moderna have filed for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for their respective Covid 19 vaccines , and both shots could be distributed this month . 
The FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a tracking system set up to assess the longer term impacts of the vaccines , Slaoui said .
