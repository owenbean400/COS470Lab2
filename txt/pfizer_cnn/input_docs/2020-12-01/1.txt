The potential coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna will be shipped out to states as soon as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes its recommendation -- and the US Food and Drug Administration grants the emergency use authorizations , according to the White House vaccine czar . 
Dr . Moncef Slaoui , the chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed , a public private partnership to accelerate development of vaccines , told CNN â€™s Erin Burnett Monday that he hopes the two decisions take place " almost simultaneously . " 
The shipments can then start immediately , he said . 
Slaoui said there are about 120 million people at risk in the US . 
" We will have by the end of the month of December about 40 million doses of vaccine . 
So it 's going to take a while for all Americans who need it on a priority level to get it . 
But , you know , over probably two or two and a half months , they will all get it . " 
Those over 65 , health care workers and frontline workers are first in line to get the vaccine , he said . 
Both Pfizer and Moderna have filed for an emergency use authorization for a Covid 19 vaccine from the FDA .
