Moncef Slaoui , the head of the US government 's effort to develop a vaccine against Covid 19 , said the first Americans to receive a vaccine -- if all things go according to plan -- could be as early as the second week of December . 
On Friday , Pfizer submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for its Covid 19 vaccine candidate , and an FDA vaccine advisory committee is slated to meet December 10 . 
Slaoui said that means , if authorized , the vaccine could be rolled out the next day . 
Slaoui also said that based on plans , the amount of the population who need to be vaccinated for life to return to normal is likely to happen in May . 
How to achieve herd immunity : Slaoui told Tapper that with the level of efficacy that has been shown in both Pfizer and Moderna 's vaccines , " 70 % or so of the population being immunized would allow for true herd immunity to take place , that is likely to happen somewhere in the month of May , or something like that based on our plans . " 
Following Slaoui 's comments on Sunday , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , told CBS ' Margaret Brennan on " Face The Nation , " that while he " totally agree ( s ) " with Slaoui that there could be herd immunity by May , it would require that a majority of the country be vaccinated . 
A new Gallup poll found that 58 % of Americans said they would get vaccinated against the coronavirus if there was an FDA approved vaccine available right now at no cost .
