Astra Zeneca 's coronavirus vaccine candidate comes with the advantage of requiring refrigeration at temperatures that are easier to reach , compared with some other vaccine candidates , a World Health Organization official pointed out during a news briefing on Monday . 
WHO Chief Scientist Dr . Soumya Swaminathan said that the vaccine can be stored and is stable in temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius . 
In comparison , Pfizer 's vaccine needs to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius . 
Regarding Astra Zeneca 's Covid 19 vaccine candidate , " The advantage of this vaccine is that it can be stored in the ordinary refrigerated temperatures , " Swaminathan said . 
" That of course has huge logistical advantages for transporting and delivering this vaccine to cities and towns and villages and rural areas around the world . 
And we hope there will be more vaccines like that , which are more heat stable , " Swaminathan said . 
" We have to also continue to encourage all the other developers who are doing clinical trials and were in early phases of development , because we do need a variety of vaccines out there that will target different groups that will have different storage conditions , " Swaminathan said . 
" The issue of affordability is also important to keep in mind . "
