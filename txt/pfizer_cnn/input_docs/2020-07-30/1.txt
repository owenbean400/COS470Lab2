The head of Operation Warp Speed said he ’s " optimistic " there will be vaccines for all Americans by the end of next year , but hopefully even sooner . 
" I am optimistic that we will have vaccines for everybody within the year 2021 , ideally within the first half of the year 2021 . 
That 's our objective , " said Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to the federal government ’s multi billion dollar program to develop a Covid 19 vaccine . 
In his first television interview since being appointed , Slaoui spoke with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen on Thursday while touring a vaccine clinical trial site in Savannah , Georgia . 
Phase 3 clinical trials – the final step before government approval – are underway in the United States for two vaccines , one made by Moderna and another by Pfizer . 
Operation Warp Speed is also funding six other vaccine efforts , Slaoui said . 
Slaoui said he expects to " probably have a few tens of millions of doses [ of vaccine ] in December and January " and those would go to high risk individuals . 
High risk individuals include the elderly and those with underlying health conditions such as hypertension , diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
