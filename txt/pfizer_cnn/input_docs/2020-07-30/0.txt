Operation Warp Speed , the federal government ’s multi billion effort to develop a vaccine against Covid 19 , will fund eight vaccines , according to the head of the program . 
Five of those are already in Phase 3 clinical trials or will be starting by the end of September , said Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed . 
So far , vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer are in Phase 3 , or phase 2/3 , of human testing in the US . 
That ’s the final round of trials before a vaccine is put on the market . 
Each trial will include about 30,000 volunteers . 
A vaccine from Astra Zeneca and University of Oxford in the UK is in Phase 3 trials in the United Kingdom , Brazil and South Africa . 
Phase 3 trials for the vaccine in the US are scheduled to begin in August , Slaoui said . 
Phase three trials for vaccines made by two other companies – Johnson & Johnson and Novavax – are scheduled to begin in September , he added . 
Slaoui did not name the other three vaccines that will receive funding from Operation Warp Speed . 
Health officials have said that having several vaccines in the pipeline will help ensure that at least one will be successful .
