Adm . Brett Giroir , the White House ’s coronavirus testing czar , told CNN that he wanted to make sure that all Americans knew that Covid 19 vaccines had been tested in tens of thousands of individuals and that there is going to be independent and transparent review of them . 
He also said that he , the surgeon general and the rest of the team " are really out there trying to educate the public . " 
While they have to wait and see what the data show , Giroir said that " all indications are this is an extremely safe vaccine , the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna , and very , very effective , over 95 % effective . " 
Giroir also spoke about immunizing for impact , or immunizing the groups that are at the highest risk , for example long term care facilities , the elderly and minorities . 
If this happens , " we can absolutely get 80 % of the benefit of the vaccine by only immunizing a few percent of the population , " he said , " and that ’s what we really need to do this month . " 
Giroir added that by the end of the year there should be enough vaccine available to immunize 20 million Americans , " and we have to immunize for impact . 
The rest of America will get in the second quarter , third quarter of 2021 , but we can maximize our impact right now . "
