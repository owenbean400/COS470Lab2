The Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine could be adjusted to better combat the new variant of the Coronavirus , Bio NTech ’s CEO Ugur Sahin told CNN ’s Fred Pleitgen in an interview on Tuesday . 
" We should not forget that we have still the opportunity , if required , to adjust the vaccine exactly to this new virus variant , if this is needed , " Sahin said . 
Sahin told CNN that Bio NTech is currently evaluating how effective the vaccine is against the recently discovered variant of the virus , which has caused dozens of countries to shut down travel to the United Kingdom . 
Sahin said he has " scientific confidence " that the vaccine will still work . 
" What we already did is we evaluated the sites where we have observed T cell responses against spike protein , and we see that almost all sites that we have seen T cell responses are still conserved . 
And so that is a good message . 
That means at least one component of the immune system will not be affected by this mutation , " Sahin added . 
On Monday Pfizer/Bio NTech received approval for their vaccine from the EU ’s regulatory body , the European Medicines Agency . 
Sahin told CNN the vaccine would be rolled out ASAP and that the companies are already working on ways to speed up production . 
" We are evaluating if we could intensify the production at the Pfizer sites and intensify the production at the Mainz sites . 
So there are multiple things , which are ongoing . "
