Some business leaders are in favor of eventually requiring their employees to take Covid 19 vaccines . 
Seventy two percent of current and former CEOs of major companies signaled an openness to Covid 19 vaccine mandates , according to a poll held Tuesday at a virtual summit by the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute . 
However , several CEOs indicated that no such mandate had yet been formulated at their companies , and that they want to see how early rounds of vaccinations go before making formal plans . 
Pfizer ’s Covid 19 vaccine has received emergency use authorization by the FDA , but has not been approved by the agency . 
The Yale summit included business leaders from Walmart , Goldman Sachs , e Bay , and other major companies . 
Some context : Legal experts say companies can require their employees to get vaccinated . 
Some jobs already have similar requirements . 
For example , hospitals may require workers to get flu or hepatitis B vaccines . 
However , companies may need to grant exemptions to workers on medical or religious grounds . 
Still , Sonnenfeld said vaccine mandates can help companies promote a culture of safety . 
" If a safe work environment is part of their culture and brand , more power to them , " he said . 
Others think that vaccine mandates go a step too far . 
" Business has a huge role to play in helping set the tone on the importance of vaccines , " said Mark Weinberger , the former CEO of EY and a director at Met Life and Johnson & Johnson . 
" But to say you ’re going to be fired if you ’re scared to death to take a vaccine , that ’s a difficult position for CEOs to take . "
