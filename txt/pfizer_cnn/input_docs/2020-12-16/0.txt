Moderna ’s Covid 19 vaccine appears to be " very promising , " Dr . Paul Offit , a member of the US Food and Drug Administration ’s vaccine advisory group , said Tuesday . 
The FDA ’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is set to meet Thursday to review Moderna ’s vaccine for emergency use authorization . 
Offit said it ’s heartening to see that the new m RNA technology works in both Pfizer and Moderna ’s vaccines , which use different formulations and slightly different dosing schedules . 
He said that in terms of safety and protection , both vaccines appear to be " roughly indistinguishable . " 
Even after emergency use authorization , there will be questions left to answer about both vaccines . 
In fact , Moderna filed extra data with the FDA Tuesday that it says indicates its vaccine does prevent infection . 
Offit noted that studies are planned for next year to address that question .
