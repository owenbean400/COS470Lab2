Pfizer is working to find out more about a report that a health worker in Alaska suffered an allergic reaction to its vaccine Wednesday . 
" We do not yet have all the details of the report from Alaska about a potential serious allergic reactions but are actively working with local health authorities to assess , " a Pfizer spokesperson told CNN . 
When British health authorities rolled out the vaccine there earlier this month , at least two recipients had allergic reactions but they recovered quickly . 
The New York Times first reported that a health care worker in Alaska suffered a reaction . 
" Participants in our Phase 3 trial were excluded if they had a history of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction ( e.g . , anaphylaxis ) to any component of the investigational vaccine , " the Pfizer spokesperson told CNN . 
" Overall , there were no safety signals of concern identified in our clinical trials , including no signal of serious allergic reactions associated with vaccine . 
However , reports of adverse events outside of clinical studies are a very important component to our pharmacovigilance activities and we will review all available information on this case and all reports of adverse events following vaccination , " she added .
