Austin Beutner , the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District , is recommending that health leaders consider schools as a site where people can get the Covid 19 vaccine . 
" It will take this all hands on deck effort , " Beutner told CNN on Wednesday , referring to the the sheer number of people who will need to be vaccinated in the US . 
" Let 's make sure we think of schools as part of the system to provide vaccine to children as was done for Polio , " Beutner added . 
Remember : Teachers and school staff probably wo not get the vaccine until April . 
First in line for the vaccine will be two groups considered to be exceptionally high risk â€“ health care workers and residents of long term care facilities such as nursing homes . 
Depending on whether more vaccines have been approved , the second phase could begin by April . 
Phase 2 might include K 12 teachers and staff and other child care workers Additionally , the Pfizer vaccine is not recommended for children yet because they were not part of phase three clinical trials . 
On the topic of a second Covid 19 stimulus package , Beutner said that getting the economy back on track starts with children and school systems . 
He told the story of a third grader in his district whose family is struggling . 
" They 've had someone in the family become gravely ill because of the virus . 
This child struggles to log on to a zoom because someone is missing in their household . 
Someone else in the household had lost work . 
I ask leadership , what can we do for that child ? " he said .
