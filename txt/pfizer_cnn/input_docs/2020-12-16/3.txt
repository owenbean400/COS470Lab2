" I ca not tell you at this precise moment how many have gotten it , " Azar told CNBC ’s Shepard Smith on Tuesday . 
" We 're just , of course , two days into the vaccination program but we do have the IT systems to generate that data and get that reporting . " 
" And as we go , several days or maybe a week into this , we ’ll start providing a dashboard with that type of information , so we know exactly how we 're doing on getting shots in arms , " he added . 
The vaccine program : Vaccinations began on Monday , with the first doses delivered to all 50 states , the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico .
