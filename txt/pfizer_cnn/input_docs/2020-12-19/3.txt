The US Food and Drug Administration is requiring the same precautions for allergic reactions with Moderna ’s coronavirus vaccine as it has for Pfizer/Bio NTech ’s vaccine , top officials said Friday . 
The FDA gave its official nod for emergency use authorization for Moderna ’s vaccine Friday evening . 
FDA Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn and Dr . Peter Marks , who heads the agency ’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , said part of the EUA included requirements that anyone administering the vaccine be ready to treat recipients for allergic reactions . 
At least three allergic reactions have been reported in the US with the Pfizer vaccine , and two in Britain . 
Hahn said the FDA was working to see what component of the vaccine might be causing an allergic reaction . 
Marks said precautions were being taken with Moderna ’s vaccine . 
No one knows if it might cause allergic reactions . 
" We simply do not know yet with the Moderna vaccine , " Marks said . 
" We ’ll continue to monitor very closely . "
