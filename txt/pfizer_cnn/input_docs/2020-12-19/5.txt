Dr . Jerome Adams said he ’s " pumped " after getting the Covid 19 vaccine on Friday morning . 
Adams said it ’s OK to ask questions and wonder if the shot is right for an individual , but he said it ’s not alright for misinformation on the vaccine to cause a person to " make a decision that is bad for your health . " 
The US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for Moderna ’s vaccine Friday night , the second vaccine to receive an EUA in the United States after Pfizer ’s last weekend .
