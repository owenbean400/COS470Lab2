Health care providers can use as many full doses as they can get from Covid 19 vaccine vials , according to US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn . 
On Friday , Hahn said it was possible to squeeze out extra doses of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine from vials if there is solution remaining in them after the standard five doses are given – and those extra doses are safe to use . 
Then on Saturday , Hahn posted to Twitter that the same approach could be used for Moderna 's Covid 19 vaccine . 
Every dose of Covid 19 vaccine " makes a difference to overcoming this pandemic , " Hahn tweeted . 
" That is why FDA is allowing providers to use as many full doses as can be obtained from multidose vaccine vials – about 6 for Pfizer and about 10 for Moderna , " he said .
