The United States remains " on track " to allocate 20 million doses of Covid 19 vaccine to states nationwide by the end of the year , Gen . Gustave Perna , chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed , said during a news briefing on Saturday . 
The nation currently has two Covid 19 vaccines – Pfizer/Bio NTech 's and Moderna 's – authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
" While this second vaccine from Moderna , added on to Pfizer , now allows us as a whole of America to be on the offense , we are a long way from being finished , " Perna said . 
" Each shipment of vaccine is another few yards gained , but any good player or coach knows that you still need defense , along with offense , to win the game . 
I join our health professionals in urging Americans to stay diligent in their defense . 
Wear a mask , wash your hands and stay socially distanced . "
