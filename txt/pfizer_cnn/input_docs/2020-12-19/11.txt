The US Food and Drug Administration will alert the public if any changes to the authorization of Pfizer 's Covid 19 vaccine are required following some reports of allergic reactions occurring after vaccination , FDA 's Dr . Doran Fink said on Saturday . 
" Some of these reactions have been confirmed to be serious or anaphylactic reactions , and we are working closely with the manufacturer to identify what the cause of these reactions might be , " Fink said . 
" We will update the public in a timely manner if we find anything that would cause us to change the conditions of the emergency use authorization or if we need to provide any additional information to inform the public about the benefits and risks of the vaccine . " 
Fink added : " However , I want to stress that at this time , the totality of the data continue to support vaccinations under the Pfizer EUA without any new restrictions , and we thank the public for remaining vigilant and reporting suspected reactions to the vaccine using the established mechanisms that have been set up .
