Another volunteer in the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine trial has had a serious allergic reaction – but that person was in the placebo group of the study , meaning they did not receive the vaccine , according to a presentation by the company at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Saturday . 
Moderna ’s Dr . Jacqueline Miller said the company is investigating the incident of the allergic reaction , which happened Friday night . 
At the time the company submitted for an emergency use authorization , Miller said there had been two serious allergic reactions among the clinical trial volunteers . 
One of those cases was also in the placebo group . 
The other volunteer , who did receive the Covid 19 vaccine , had an allergic reaction 63 days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine . 
That person reported having a history of allergies to shellfish . 
It ’s unclear what caused the allergic reaction . 
More details : Moderna said it has been examining its data to see if any of the other volunteers have had an allergic reaction within 48 hours following vaccination . 
Four volunteers did report some kind of allergic reaction , but none of those reactions was considered serious .
