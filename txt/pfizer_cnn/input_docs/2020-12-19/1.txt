The extra doses in Pfizer/Bio NTech Covid 19 vials are safe and should be used , US Food and Drug Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said Friday . 
It ’s possible to squeeze out extra doses of Pfizer ’s vaccine from the vials , if there is solution remaining in them after the standard five doses are given , the FDA said earlier this week . 
Hahn said that it ’s not uncommon for extra solution to be in vaccine vials . 
" It 's a very common thing , " he said . 
" There ’s always some overage that occurs , just to make sure that there 's enough for the doses that are said to be within the vial . " 
It ’s important to plan for anyone who receives one vaccine dose to get a second , Hahn said . 
" If you want the 95 % protection , the clinical trial shows that the two dose regimen , 21 days apart , is what you need , " he said . 
" But given that this overage is in the vials , we believe that that can be factored into subsequent calculations . "
