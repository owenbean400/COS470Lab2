The US Food and Drug Administration formally issued emergency use authorization Friday for Moderna ’s coronavirus vaccine , the second after Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s to get the OK for emergency use in the US . 
While Pfizer developed its vaccine independently , Moderna worked with the National Institutes of Health to develop and test its vaccine . 
Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller also weighed in . 
" The swift authorization of a second vaccine by the FDA is great news for the American people . 
The Do D , with the work of General ( Gustave ) Perna and Operation Warp Speed , stands ready to work with our public and private sector partners to ensure doses reach Americans as soon as possible . 
Together , we will bring this pandemic to an end , " Miller said .
