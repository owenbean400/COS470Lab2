Moderna and Pfizer appear to be " neck and neck " in the race for a Covid 19 vaccine — so much so that the United States could see critical safety and efficacy data for both companies ' vaccine candidates around the same time , Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said during a Facebook Live session on Thursday . 
Currently , there are six Covid 19 vaccine candidates in the United States — four of which are in Phase 3 trials , Fauci said , adding that Moderna and Pfizer are " neck and neck . " 
" Pfizer and Moderna , both went into Phase 3 on July 27 , " Fauci told Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , during the Facebook Live session . 
" Close behind them is the Astra Zeneca , and the Johnson or J & J or the Janssen trial — and then we have the trial of Novavax and then ultimately we have Sanofi , " Fauci said . 
" So we would likely , Francis , start seeing results from Moderna and Pfizer at approximately the same time . "
