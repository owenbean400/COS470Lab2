The US Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has scheduled a meeting of its outside advisory panel to discuss Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s application for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine . 
The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee ( VRBPAC ) will meet on Dec . 10 . 
The companies submitted their application for an EUA earlier Friday . 
It ’s the first application for an FDA regulatory OK for a coronavirus vaccine . 
" The FDA has been preparing for the review of EUAs for Covid 19 vaccines for several months and stands ready to do so as soon as an EUA request is submitted . 
While we cannot predict how long the FDA 's review will take , the FDA will review the request as expeditiously as possible , while still doing so in a thorough and science based manner , so that we can help make available a vaccine that the American people deserve as soon as possible . " 
The FDA is supposed to post the VRBPAC meeting schedule in the Federal Register at least two weeks ahead of time . 
The agency has promised to fully consider input from the committee , which is made up of vaccine experts and others with no ties to the companies submitting vaccines for FDA approval or authorization . 
The FDA said it will livestream the VRBPAC meeting on the agency 's You Tube , Facebook and Twitter channels and from the FDA website .
