German firm Bio NTech is confident it will seek regulatory approval by the end of the year for a coronavirus vaccine , the company 's CEO told The Wall Street Journal in an interview conducted Wednesday and published on Friday . 
Dr . Ugur Sahin said that due to the spread of the virus , it could take about a decade for the world 's population to achieve immunity , even if several vaccines become available at the same time . 
Bio NTech has partnered with Pfizer in the US to develop the vaccine . 
" I assume that we will only be done with this virus when more than 90 % of the global population will get immunity , either through infection or through a vaccine , " Sahin told the Journal . 
Sahin added the company could produce several hundred million doses before approval and more than 1 billion doses by the end of 2021 . 
Last week , Bio NTech and Pfizer announced that the Covid 19 vaccine in development had yielded positive data in early tests . 
The companies shared their preliminary findings on July 1 in a pre print paper that shows participants in a Phase 1/2 study of the vaccine , called BNT162b1 , responded to the immunization and it was found to be well tolerated . 
The Phase 1/2 study is ongoing and the data has not yet been published in a peer reviewed medical journal . 
The preliminary data will help researchers determine a dose level for the vaccine , then select which of their multiple vaccine candidates to progress to a larger scale global Phase 2/3 study , which could begin as early as this month , the companies said .
