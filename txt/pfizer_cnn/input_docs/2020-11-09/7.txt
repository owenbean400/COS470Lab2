Despite promising early results from Pfizer â€™s trials , the coronavirus vaccine is " not a magic bullet , " Dr . Leana Wen , emergency physician and CNN medical analyst , said Monday . 
The drugmaker announced Monday that its vaccine appears to be more than 90 % effective , based on early data . 
Wen said that efficacy figure refers to the vaccine 's ability to prevent any Covid 19 infection , as opposed to severe infection from the virus . 
Wen said she hopes Pfizer will make its data publicly available . 
The company is expected to do so when it applies to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization . 
Wen added that " there is a long road between actually getting the vaccine approved and getting it distributed to hundreds of millions of Americans , " emphasizing the importance of basic public health measures in the meantime .
