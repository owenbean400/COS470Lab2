Pfizer will need to submit data on its vaccine candidate to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and wait for a review -- two stages that will take several weeks each , US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News . 
The drugmaker said on Monday that early data shows its vaccine is 90 % effective , but Azar said Pfizer needed to pull together the details and provide them to the FDA for an independent review process before authorization . 
Azar said that thanks to Operation Warp Speed , the government has guaranteed receipt of an FDA authorized vaccine from Pfizer -- 100 million doses that were purchased for around $ 2 billion , Azar said . 
There is also an option for another 500 million . 
These will start in increments of about 20 million doses , which begin in late November and continue monthly , according to Azar . 
The timescale : In a news release on Monday , Pfizer said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA , soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months following their second dose of vaccine , as requested by the agency . 
Pfizer said it anticipated reaching that marker by the third week of November .
