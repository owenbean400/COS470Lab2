Drugmaker Pfizer has said its coronavirus vaccine is more than 90 % effective according to an early look at data -- a much better than expected efficacy if the trend continues . 
A so called interim analysis from the company examined the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid 19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who received either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo . 
The analysis found fewer than 10 % of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine . 
More than 90 % of the cases were in people who had been given a placebo . 
Pfizer said that the vaccine provided protection seven days after the second vaccine dose and 28 days after the initial dose . 
The company 's final goal is to reach 164 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection . 
In a press release , the pharmaceutical giant said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months after getting their second dose of vaccine , as requested by the FDA . 
Pfizer said it anticipated reaching that point by the third week of November . 
Its vaccine trial is conducted in partnership with German company Bio NTech . 
The Phase 3 vaccine trial has enrolled 43,538 participants since July 27 . 
As of Sunday , 38,955 of the volunteers have received a second dose of the vaccine . 
The company says 42 % of international trial sites and 30 % of US trial sites involve volunteers of racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds . 
Pfizer 's study will also evaluate whether the vaccine protects people against severe Covid 19 disease and whether the vaccine can provide long term protection against Covid 19 disease , even in patients who have been infected before . 
The US FDA has said it would expect at least 50 % efficacy from any coronavirus vaccine . 
Bio NTech 's shares rose sharply after the news .
