Vaccine maker Novavax said Monday it had won fast track designation for its experimental coronavirus vaccine from the US Food and Drug Administration – something that could help speed regulatory approval or emergency use authorization . 
That would make it the fifth coronavirus vaccine to enter late stage clinical trials in the US . 
Vaccines being made by Moderna and Pfizer have also received FDA fast track designation . 
The Maryland based company has been awarded $ 1.6 billion from the federal government ’s Operation Warp Speed to help it run clinical trials of the vaccine . 
Like several other experimental coronavirus vaccines , Novavax ’s would require two doses . 
It hopes deliver 100 million doses by the end of this year . 
Novavax 's vaccine is made by growing synthetic versions of the coronavirus spike protein in armyworm moth cells . 
The vaccine combines these particles with the company ’s adjuvant -- a plant based compound that helps boost the immune response to the vaccine .
