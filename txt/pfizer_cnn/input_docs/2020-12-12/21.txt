Some states are planning to vaccinate health care workers and residents of long term care facilities all together in one group as Covid 19 vaccines arrive at sites , a top Operation Warp Speed official said Saturday . 
It would be a more efficient way to use vaccines that must be stored carefully and used quickly , Gen . Gustave Perna , chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed , said at a news conference . 
Some background : The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the very first vaccines should go to frontline health care workers most at risk of catching and transmitting the virus , and to residents of long term care facilities such as nursing homes , who make up the bulk of those killed in the pandemic so far . 
It ’s up to states to decide who actually gets vaccines distributed to them . 
Operation Warp Speed expects to start shipping about 2.9 million doses of Pfizer ’s vaccine Sunday .
