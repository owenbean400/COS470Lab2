Pfizer â€™s coronavirus vaccines are still being packaged before being shipped to states , Gen . Gustave Perna , chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed , said at a news conference Saturday . 
Perna said federal officials and vaccine maker Pfizer were aiming to distribute the vaccine Monday , once the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization , which came Friday evening . 
Federal health officials have repeatedly promised a coronavirus vaccine would be rolling out within 24 hours of an EUA . 
Mc Kesson is the medical supplies company the federal government has contracted with to help distribute coronavirus vaccines . 
" The important part , as I said in my statement , was we want to make sure that the vaccine arrives at a time period where people , the professionals are available to receive it and then eventually administer it . 
So as a decision ( was ) made , and I adjusted the sliding scale hourly and daily , " Perna added . 
" Our ultimate goal was to get it there no later than Monday morning , through distribution . 
So as I speak today right now , vaccines are being packaged , with a lot of emphasis on the quality assurance . 
To that end , tomorrow morning vaccines will start rolling from manufacturing to distribution hubs . 
And then Monday , by Monday , vaccinations will be received . "
