US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn denied on Saturday that political pressure led to a quicker than normal decision to issue emergency use authorization for Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine . 
The FDA issued the EUA Friday evening , a day after its Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted to recommend the authorization . 
But as the FDA considered the vote , Hahn was summoned to the White House . 
The FDA said it reviewed not just Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s summary of their clinical trial involving around 40,000 volunteers , but went through to original source data . 
It showed the vaccine was safe and provided 95 % protection . 
" Our incredible team , heroic efforts , night and day worked to get this out the door , " Hahn said . 
" As Dr . Marks said , thousands of people are dying a day . "
