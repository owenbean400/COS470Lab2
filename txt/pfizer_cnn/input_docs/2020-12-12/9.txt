The US Food and Drug Administration 's emergency use authorization of Pfizer and Bio NTech 's coronavirus vaccine is a crucial step in developing the new generation vaccine , Bio NTech CEO Ugur Sahin said . 
The FDA authorized the vaccine late Friday night after its advisers recommended the go ahead . 
The US follows several other countries in authorizing the vaccine , including Britain , which has already immunized at least 2,000 people . 
The EUA was fast by US regulatory standards -- especially for a vaccine using new technology . 
How does it work ? 
Bio NTech 's vaccine uses messenger RNA , genetic material that codes for a piece of the virus 's spike protein -- the outside hook that attaches to the cells the virus attacks . 
This m RNA prompts the human body to produce little pieces of the protein , and then produce an immune response against it . 
Clinical trials in more than 40,000 people showed it was 95 % effective in preventing symptomatic disease . 
Pfizer has only been able to produce a few million doses for the US so far , so it will not immediately affect the pandemic , Sahin said . 
But after more people get vaccinated , the effects will kick in , he predicted .
