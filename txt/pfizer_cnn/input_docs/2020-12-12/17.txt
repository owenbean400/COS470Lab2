The US Food and Drug Administration says the potential benefits of the Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine outweigh the risks for 16 - and 17 year olds , Dr . Peter Marks , director of FDA ’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , said during a news briefing on Saturday . 
FDA has a long history of evaluating pediatric vaccines and extrapolating data from adults to children , he said . 
Although teens rarely become seriously ill from Covid 19 , Marks acknowledged some do become very sick and die . 
And , teens are able to transmit the virus " quite easily " – even if they ’re asymptomatic . 
" Since some of those 16 - and 17 year olds , at least that I know of , are out there as checkout people , or interacting with communities , it may be wise that we are able to vaccinate them , " Marks said . 
" So we think the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks . " 
It will take a few months before it ’s clear how the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus , Marks said . 
On pregnant women : Decisions about whether pregnant women should take Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s Covid 19 vaccine should be considered on an individual basis , Marks said . 
" Covid 19 in a pregnant woman is not a good thing , so someone might decide that they would like to be vaccinated , but that 's not something that we 're recommending at this time . 
That 's something we 're leaving up to the individual , " Marks said . 
Marks said that the clinical trials of the vaccine , which did not enroll pregnant women but included women who became pregnant during the trials , did not yield enough data to make a determination for that population . 
" For pregnant women and the immunocompromised – just at this point – it will be something that providers will need to consider on an individual basis for patients , " said Marks .
