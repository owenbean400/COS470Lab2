Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they had little difficulty voting to recommend Pfizer ’s coronavirus vaccine to people living in the United States . 
Some context : The US Food and Drug Administration gave Pfizer and Bio NTech ’s vaccine emergency use authorization on Friday . 
ACIP met Saturday and voted to recommend that CDC approve the vaccine for use in the US and add it to the vaccine schedule . 
Now the CDC must decide whether to accept the ACIP ’s recommendation before vaccines can actually be given to people , but officials with the US federal government ’s Operation Warp Speed say they are boxing up vaccines to ship them out for delivery on Monday . 
Szilagyi said he felt strongly that 16 - and 17 year olds should be included in the recommendation . 
" I also wanted to re emphasize what many people and I have said today about the need for substantially increased government funding to actually implement the recommendation , " Szilagyi added .
