The US Army general in charge of distributing America ’s first coronavirus vaccines says he ’s confident it will be done safely , even if it ’s not done perfectly . 
Perna said the federal government was only delivering half the doses on hand , because Pfizer ’s vaccine , which received US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization Friday , requires two doses . 
" For me , it 's a moral responsibility and obligation to make sure that second dose is available for the American people , " Perna said . 
" We want to ensure the vaccine arrives safely and that it can be effectively administered once arrival occurs . 
I t is so important that all vaccine that 's available is utilized as a shot in an arm and nothing is wasted . " 
Perna said vaccines should be delivered Monday . 
" The reason why we 're holding on to the second dose , as well as some reserve , is that we do not have absolute confidence in the cadence – not because Pfizer or Moderna or the supporting manufacturers and fill finishes are not diligent in their process . 
But it is such a delicate process , we want to ensure perfection in the vaccine because we do not want anything going into an arm that would be a problem , " Perna said .
