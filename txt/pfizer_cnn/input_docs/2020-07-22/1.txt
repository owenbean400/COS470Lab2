US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called the US government ’s agreement with Pfizer " historic " on CNBC Wednesday morning . 
Azar said that clinical data from the phase 1 trial of the Pfizer vaccine shows that it produces what is looked for in the early stages of a vaccine : " neutralizing antibodies [ at ] levels equal to or better than what we see in recovered Covid patients and their convalescent plasma . " 
" So , really a historic agreement that President Trump led us to here , " Azar said . 
The Pfizer news comes on the heels of four other major investments , Azar said . 
The other four investments are in Astra Zeneca , Moderna , Novovax and Johnson & Johnson ’s vaccine from its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutical .
