The data Pfizer and Bio NTech have released so far on their Covid 19 vaccine candidate " are really exciting and give us great hope , " US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn said Thursday . 
The companies said this week the data from the clinical trials show the potential coronavirus vaccine is 95 % effective in preventing disease and that they plan to file for an emergency use authorization from the FDA on Friday . 
Hahn said the agency needs to see the raw data on the vaccine . 
" So what will be submitted to us is raw data around the clinical trial that would support a claim for safety and effectiveness of the vaccine , which of course is our primary responsibility here , with an emergency use authorization or an outright approval , " he said . 
That â€™s not the only thing the agency reviews . 
After the FDA receives the application , Hahn said the agency will set a date for a meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , or VRBPAC . 
A source told CNN this week the date had already been set , for December 8 , 9 and 10 . 
But Hahn said a date has not yet been set . Once the application is submitted to the FDA , agency scientists review it and come to their own conclusions , Hahn said .
