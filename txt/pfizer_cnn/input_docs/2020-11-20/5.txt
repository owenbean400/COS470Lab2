Pfizer and Bio NTech said they will request an emergency use authorization for their coronavirus vaccine from the US Food and Drug Administration today . 
This is the first coronavirus vaccine to seek a regulatory OK in the United States . 
The companies said in a statement that their vaccine candidate , known as BNT162b2 , will potentially be available for use in high risk populations in the United States by the middle to end of December . 
The submission to the FDA is based on results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of Pfizer â€™s vaccine , which began in the United States on July 27 and enrolled more than 43,000 volunteers . 
The final analysis from the trial found the coronavirus vaccine was 95 % effective in preventing infections , even in older adults , and caused no serious safety concerns , Pfizer and its German partner , Bio NTech , announced this week . 
The submission also includes safety data on about 100 children ages 12 to 15 .
