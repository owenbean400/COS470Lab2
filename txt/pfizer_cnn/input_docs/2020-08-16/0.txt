The multibillion dollar effort to get a coronavirus vaccine on the market could see delays because researchers have not recruited sufficient numbers of minorities to join the clinical trials . 
Of the 350,000 people who 've registered online for a coronavirus clinical trial , 10 % are Black or Latino , according to Dr . Jim Kublin , executive director of operations for the Covid 19 Prevention Network . 
Dr . Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , gave the Moderna trial , the first in Phase 3 in the United States , a " C " grade for recruiting minorities . 
Study subjects in trials are supposed to reflect the population that 's affected . 
Research shows that more than half of US coronavirus cases have been among Black and Latino people . 
If not enough Black people and other minorities enroll , the panel of experts who monitor the trials could force a delay until they get the numbers they need . 
" That 's something that 's been actively discussed , " said Dr . Nelson Michael , coordinator of community engagement activities for Operation Warp Speed , the government 's effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine . 
" There 's a lot of concern . " 
Pfizer and Moderna started their Phase 3 vaccine clinical trials on July 27 and expect to have them fully enrolled in September . 
Other vaccine trials will soon follow , and Operation Warp Speed aims to deliver 300 million doses of a Covid 19 vaccine by January . 
That â€™s a speed unheard of in the history of vaccine clinical trials .
