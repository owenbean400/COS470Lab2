Moderna , the first company to start US clinical trials of a Covid 19 vaccine , finished enrolling all 30,000 of its participants on Thursday . 
All 30,000 have received their first shot , and most of them have also received the required second shot . 
Dr . Stephen Hoge , Moderna 's president , said the company is now on track to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization to put the vaccine on the market in early December " if all the stars align . " 
Hoge said enrolling 30,000 participants is " just a milestone – it ’s not the mission . " 
Half of the participants received the vaccine and half received a placebo , or a shot of saline that does nothing . 
The participants receive a second shot four weeks later . 
Some background : Moderna is one of four US Phase 3 trials of coronavirus vaccines , each involving tens of thousands of participants . 
Moderna started its Phase 3 trial on July 27 , and Pfizer started its trial that evening . 
Astra Zeneca started its US trial Aug . 31 and paused it about a week later when a participant fell ill . 
Johnson & Johnson started its trial Sept . 23 and paused it less than three weeks later for the same reason . 
Both of those pauses are still in effect . 
Pfizer has said it could apply for emergency use authorization after the third week in November What happens next : Hoge said three things needs to happen before Moderna applies to the FDA for emergency use authorization . 
Moderna also released the racial breakdown of its study participants on Thursday . 
Of the 30,000 participants , 20 % are Latino and 10 % are Black . 
Those are higher than the percentages the company was achieving early in its trial , but still lower than the percentages sought by Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institutes for Allergies and Infectious Diseases .
