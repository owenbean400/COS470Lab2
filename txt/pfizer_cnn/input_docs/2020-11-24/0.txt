The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has asked members of its vaccine advisory committee to reserve Dec . 17 and 18 for meetings , presumably to discuss a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Moderna , according to a source familiar with the process . 
The FDA consults with its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee before allowing any vaccine -- including a coronavirus vaccine -- to go on the market . 
On Sunday , Moncef Slaoui , the head of Operation Warp Speed , mentioned a Dec . 17 FDA review for Moderna ’s Covid 19 vaccine . 
Last week , the pharmaceutical company announced that initial data shows its vaccine is 94.5 % effective against Covid 19 . 
The FDA has called a meeting of the committee for Dec . 10 to consider Pfizer ’s application for emergency use authorization for the vaccine it has developed with its partner Bio NTech . 
Pfizer says its vaccine is 95 % effective against Covid 19 . 
Moderna is awaiting more data on study participants who became ill with coronavirus and could apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization in the next week , according to a Moderna spokesman .
