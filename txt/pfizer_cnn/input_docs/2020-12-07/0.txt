A Covid 19 vaccine will not show an impact on mortality rate immediately , Dr . Anthony Fauci said Monday . 
The top infectious disease expert in the US pointed to the time frame of administering the vaccine and the time take for it to create the immunity in the system . 
" When you vaccinate people — not only the health care workers , but vulnerable people , for example in nursing homes — by the time they get an immunity , which would be , you know , you have a prime and then you have a boost and then you have seven to 10 days after the boost . " 
He insisted that if an adequate amount of people were to get vaccinated on time , this pandemic could be under control . 
Remember : The US Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved a coronavirus vaccine , but both Pfizer and Moderna have apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine . 
The FDA will meet with its advisory committee this month to review Pfizer 's and Moderna 's applications . 
In the meantime , Fauci expressed concerns about Christmas celebrations that could cause cases to spike . 
The current surge in cases across the country is already concerning but " it was predictable , " Fauci added . 
" We had a very high baseline of cases to begin with . 
You know , even at the time when things seemed to have been calming down , it never got down to a low baseline . 
Then we had a combination of a bunch of things , all of which synergized to put us in the difficult position we 're in now , " he told CNN , referring to cold weather , flu season and the holiday celebrations . 
As the cold weather sets in , Fauci says he has transitioned from running to power walking for three or four miles with his wife .
