" People are going indoors , they 're not minding the three W 's , " Azar told Fox News 's Chris Wallace Sunday . 
" Our advice is always the same . 
Wash your hands , watch your distance , wear face coverings . " 
Azar later told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos : " We 're worried about people and the behaviors coming up with Christmas ... 
We want to make sure everyone 's loved ones are there next Christmas , especially when we have so much hope of vaccines . " 
This morning , Dr . Anthony Fauci said he , too , is worried about Christmas , saying the holiday could be even more of a challenge " than Thanksgiving , since the season runs for more than a week , from before Christmas Eve to New Year 's Day . 
" I hope that people realize that and understand that as difficult as this is , nobody wants to modify – if not essentially shut down – their holiday season , but we are in a very critical time in this country right now . "
