Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration and a board member of Pfizer , told CBS ’s Margaret Brennan on Sunday that his guess is that a Covid 19 vaccine will be annual until more is learned . 
" We do not know yet , " Gottlieb told Brennan when she asked whether people would have to go back and get the vaccine every year . 
Gottlieb said that there is some data that suggests " the immunity is fairly durable and might last longer than a year , but we just do not know that yet . " 
He added that this probably would not be known at the time a vaccine gets authorized either , " so my guess is it ’s going to be an annual vaccination for a period of time until we learn more . " 
Gottlieb also spoke about the safety profile of the vaccine , saying " the safety profile has been good in the clinical trials . " 
Most vaccine related adverse events happened in the first 40 days or two months of vaccination , he said . 
" But , we ’re not going to know the full profile until you have that long term follow up data , " which is why the FDA is taking what he called a prudent approach and probably wo not generally license the vaccine until they have six or eight months of long term follow up data on trial participants who were vaccinated and people who are vaccinated in the next several months .
