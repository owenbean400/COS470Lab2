World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned against pinning all hope on a Covid 19 vaccine , saying people need to remain vigilant and take precautions against coronavirus . 
" European countries are struggling but the virus has not changed significantly , nor the measures to stop it . 
" A vaccine is needed urgently , but we cannot wait for a vaccine and put all our eggs in one basket . "

Several governments have warned that health systems will be overwhelmed if the number of new infections is not brought under control soon . 
Pfizer said Monday that its vaccine candidate was more than 90 % effective , according to early results -- news which was met with relief globally . 
But while Pfizer 's news appears promising , significant logistical challenges remain in terms of distributing a potential vaccine .
