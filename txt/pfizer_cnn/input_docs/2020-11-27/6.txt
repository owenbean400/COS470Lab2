Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called an emergency meeting Tuesday so they can vote on recommendations for the first people to get a coronavirus vaccine once one gets emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration , the committee ’s chair told CNN Friday . 
" We foresee imminent authorization if this vaccine is shown to be effective and safe in the near future and we want to be at the point where we are providing appropriate guidance to the states and jurisdictions for the use of these vaccines , " said Romero , who is Secretary for Health for the Arkansas Department of Health . 
" This is not something that is being rushed . 
We have already discussed the groups within the first tier . 
We are simply going over the data once again and having a vote primarily on the first tier group 1a – health care providers and the people in the long term , congregate facilities . " 
ACIP met on Monday to discuss the priority groups for receiving any vaccine that may get emergency use authorization from the FDA . 
The CDC has already recommended that the first group – designated as 1a – should be frontline health providers and support personnel , as well as residents of long term care facilities who have been hardest hit by the pandemic . 
" It is important because these are the individuals that are really at the front line providing the care , " Romero said . 
Vaccine maker Pfizer has submitted to the FDA for emergency use authorization , or EUA , for its vaccine and biotech company Moderna is expected to do so , also . 
The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its own vaccine advisers for Dec . 10 . 
Romero said it was important for ACIP to hold a public meeting and a public vote .
