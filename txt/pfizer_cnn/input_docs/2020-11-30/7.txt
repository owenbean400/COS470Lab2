The large shipment sizes of Pfizer ’s Covid 19 vaccine will complicate an already complex distribution process for small and rural communities , experts say . 
Pfizer has planned for the ultra cold storage requirements of its vaccine , with thermal shippers that can hold at least 975 and up to 5,000 doses . 
" That ’s not workable from a small town , rural perspective , " Alan Morgan , chief executive officer of the National Rural Health Association , told CNN Monday . 
" It just is not . " 
Smaller communities will have to spread those doses among multiple providers , Claire Hannan , executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers , told CNN Monday . 
" States that have smaller providers or rural communities , they ’re looking for ways to break up those 975 doses , spread them across more providers , without endangering the cold chain , " she said . 
Hannan said immunization managers are looking into various solutions , like using a hub and spoke model , where the vaccine is stored in a central location for providers to pick up , or having doses sent to a warehouse site , where they will be repackaged before distribution . 
If rural communities do not come up with workable plans for distribution , the danger is that rural hubs will be sidelined , Morgan said . 
" That type of approach just sets up these rural communities across the US for really unacceptable mortality rates and the potential for the collapse of the health care system , " he said . 
Pfizer did not have an immediate response questions about the concerns over shipment sizes .
