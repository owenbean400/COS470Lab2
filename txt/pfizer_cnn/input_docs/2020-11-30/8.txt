Pfizer has sent states storage boxes for its Covid 19 vaccine so that health care workers can become accustomed to using them , according to a spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Unlike any other Covid 19 vaccine , Pfizer ’s vaccine has to be kept at minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit . 
Doctors ’ offices , pharmacies and state vaccination clinics do not have freezers that go that low , so Pfizer invented special boxes they call " thermal shippers " that hold dry ice . 
The boxes being sent to the states will be empty , with no dry ice and no vaccines . 
" Pfizer is sending out the sample shippers so jurisdictions can feel better about what it is , " the spokesperson said . 
Some states received the boxes Monday , and others will receive them in the next few days , according to the spokesperson . 
State immunization clinics have been concerned about using the boxes because they must be regularly re stocked with dry ice and can only be opened twice a day , each time for no more than a minute . 
State immunization managers have for weeks expressed concern about administering Pfizer ’s vaccine because of the temperature requirements . 
" We all are going into this expecting that there are going to be major glitches , " Dr . Kelly Moore told CNN earlier this month . 
Moore is associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition , which is supporting the frontline workers who will administer the coronavirus vaccine . 
Pfizer ’s vaccine will likely be the first to receive emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration . 
Americans could start receiving Pfizer ’s vaccine , as well as one made by Moderna , by Christmas , US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Monday .
