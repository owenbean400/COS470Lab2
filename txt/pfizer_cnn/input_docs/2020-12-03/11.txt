It ’s still unclear whether a person who receives Pfizer ’s Covid 19 vaccine can still transmit the virus , company CEO Albert Bourla said Thursday . 
Bourla also told host Lester Holt he believes vaccine trial participants who received a placebo rather that the actual shot should get the vaccine . 
" It is a moral and ethical dilemma and obligation , " Bourla said . 
" I believe that in discussion with regulators , we should find a way , so sooner rather than later , give to all the placebo participants the vaccine . " 
If that happens , it would mean unblinding the vaccine trial – something that could impact the longer term results , health experts have said . 
Pfizer has asked the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for its vaccine . 
The FDA ’s advisers meet Dec . 10 to discuss the application . 
But Dr . Paul Offit , director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA ’s vaccine advisory committee , told Holt there are still a lot of unanswered questions . 
" We sort of have a million questions to make sure that we understand exactly what the safety issues are and exactly what the efficacy issues are , " Offit said . 
" Is it effective in people over 65 ? 
Is it equally effective among racial groups , ethnic groups ? 
Is it effective in people who have various medical conditions ? " 
But there ’s one question that he does have an answer for , Offit said . 
" The standard we 're going to hold this too is , would I give this vaccine to myself or my own family ? 
And if the answer to that question is , ‘ I 'm not sure , ’ then we 're not going to move forward . "
