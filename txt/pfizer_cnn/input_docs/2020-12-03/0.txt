The UK became the first Western country to authorize a Covid 19 vaccine on Wednesday , marking a pivotal moment in the global fight against coronavirus . 
The Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine has been granted emergency authorization by British regulators , and the first doses are expected to be rolled out from early next week . 
Britain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic , with the highest death toll in Europe , and its government has been heavily criticized for its handling of the crisis .

The MHRA began a rolling review of Pfizer and Bio NTech data from October , with each " package " of data reviewed as soon as it became available .
