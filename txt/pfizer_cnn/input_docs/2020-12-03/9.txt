The UK became the first Western country to authorize a Covid 19 vaccine yesterday , marking a pivotal moment in the global fight against coronavirus . 
The Pfizer/Bio NTech vaccine has been granted emergency authorization by British regulators , and the first doses are expected to be rolled out from early next week . 
The UK leapfrogged both the European Union and the United States with this announcement . 
The vaccine was granted emergency authorization in the UK by its independent regulator , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , which has played a crucial part in the process . 
The MHRA began a rolling review of Pfizer and Bio NTech data from October , with each " package " of data reviewed as soon as it became available . 
This allowed regulators to examine the data in detail before a final authorization application was submitted . 
According to the MHRA , a rolling review " can be used to complete the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency in the shortest time possible . " 
This approach helped accelerate the authorization process , and a formal review of all the necessary information began in the UK on Nov . 23 , leading to Wednesday 's announcement . 
" I think the advantage is that the MHRA has been undertaking a rolling review , which means that as Pfizer accumulated data on how they manufactured the vaccine ... 
MHRA could keep pace with that , " David Salisbury , associate fellow in Chatham House 's Global Health Programme , told CNN . 
" That has allowed the MHRA to be nimble and keep pace . "
