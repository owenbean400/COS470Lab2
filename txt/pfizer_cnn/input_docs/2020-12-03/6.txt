The Department of Defense released the first images of a Covid 19 vaccination record card and vaccination kits Wednesday . 
Vaccination cards will be used as the " simplest " way to keep track of Covid 19 shots , said Dr . Kelly Moore , associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition , which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid 19 vaccinations . 
" Everyone will be issued a written card that they can put in their wallet that will tell them what they had and when their next dose is due , " Moore said . 
" Let 's do the simple , easy thing first . 
Everyone 's going to get that . " 
Remember : No vaccine has been approved in the US yet , but Pfizer and Moderna are awaiting emergency use authorizations for their vaccine candidates . 
A panel with the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to discuss whether to authorize the EUAs on Dec . 10 and 17 . 
Should Pfizer and Moderna get the authorization , the vaccines ' first shipments could happen Dec . 15 and 22 , respectively , according to a document from the federal government 's Operation Warp Speed .
