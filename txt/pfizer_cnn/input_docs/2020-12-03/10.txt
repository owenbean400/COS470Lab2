Kentucky Gov . 
Andy Beshear said Thursday that 12,675 of the 38,000 doses in the first shipment of Pfizer vaccines to reach the state will be going to frontline health care workers , those dealing with or exposed to Covid 19 , and those working in the emergency room or in Covid wings . 
According to the governor , the shipments will arrive as early as Dec . 15 and the remaining two thirds of the doses will be going to long term care facilities , where CVS and Walgreens will handle distribution and administration , Beshear said . 
The governor announced that the first 11 health care sites that will be receiving doses , were chosen because they were large enough to handle the minimum pallet size Pfizer ships , and because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention required that they have ultra low cold storage to receive them .
