When states begin receiving their share of the limited Pfizer Covid 19 vaccines , perhaps as soon as this month , they ’re going to make some decisions about vaccinations based on their own circumstances , Dr . Scott Gottlieb , the former head of the US Food and Drug Administration , said Wednesday . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted Tuesday to recommend giving the limited number of initial vaccines to healthcare workers and residents in long term care facilities , but Gottlieb said states still have some leeway . 
When it comes to distributions to healthcare workers , Gottlieb said the majority will be sent to hospitals , which will have to decide which staff get vaccinated first , " based on their exposure to Covid , their proximity to the virus . " 
He said he expects the 3 million residents of long term care facilities and staff there to get the vaccine quickly , given the high risk that they face .
