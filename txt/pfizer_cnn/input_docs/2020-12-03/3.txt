British health regulators who authorized Pfizer ’s Covid 19 vaccine on Wednesday did not scrutinize the trial data as carefully as the US Food and Drug Administration is doing in its review , Dr . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , claimed . 
Fauci said it ’s important that Americans feel good about a potential Covid 19 vaccine . 
" So , it 's almost a damned if you do and you 're damned if you do not , because if you go quickly and you do it superficially , people are not going to want to get vaccinated , " he said . 
" We have the gold standard of a regulatory approach with the FDA . 
The UK did not do it as carefully and they got a couple of days ahead , " he said . 
" I do not think that makes much difference . 
We 'll be there . 
We 'll be there very soon . "
