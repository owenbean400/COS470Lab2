In the United Kingdom , people are getting Pfizer 's Covid vaccine . 
The idea that we 've officially entered the vaccine stage of this thing in the Western Hemisphere actually made me do a fist pump this morning . 
This is huge . 
The process looks very organized in the UK , where they 're converting sports stadiums to vaccine delivery locations for the masses . 
That is in part because in the UK they have the National Health Service , which means structure for everyone , ultimately , to get stuck . 
( Prime Minister Boris Johnson is waiting for his place in line , he said today . ) 
Here in the US , there is second guessing of a Trump administration decision not to buy more vaccine from Pfizer , which is first out of the gate in the UK . 
It 's also likely to be first in the US , but did not take part in all of Operation Warp Speed , the US vaccine effort . 
( Note : A former board member for Moderna , a Pfizer competitor , leads Operation Warp Speed . ) 
And there is no clear idea who will get the vaccine when in the US , although an executive order should be coming from President Donald Trump on that . 
Here , there 's a profit motive to health care and it 's not clear to me that everyone will get a dose for free . 
It 's also not clear who will want to take it . 
An administration official said Monday that by the end of March , 100 million Americans could have a vaccination -- everyone who wants it . 
There are more than 300 million people in this country .
