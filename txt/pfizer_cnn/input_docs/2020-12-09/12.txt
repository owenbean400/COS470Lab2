US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said there will be enough vaccine for any American who wants one by the end of the second quarter of 2021 . 
Twenty million Americans should be vaccinated against Covid 19 by the end of 2020 , 50 million by the end of January and at least 100 million should be vaccinated by the end of the first quarter , Azar said at an Operation Warp Speed briefing Wednesday . 
Characterizing the results from the US Food and Drug Administration â€™s assessment of the Pfizer vaccine trial as " more good news , " Azar said people still do need to wear a mask , wash hands , avoid crowds and keep physical distance to stop the spread of Covid 19 . 
" Even as we have such a bright future ahead , we face extremely concerning trends in the spread of the virus , " Azar said . 
" Hospitalization rates are now at the highest they have been during the pandemic . 
We are so close to being able to protect millions of Americans from this virus with the vaccine . 
For now , we need to double down on the steps that can keep us all safe . "
