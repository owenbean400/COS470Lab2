While the significant allergic reactions that two health care workers in the United Kingdom experienced after receiving Pfizer 's Covid 19 vaccine are of concern , Dr . Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday that such a reaction is likely " unusual and rare . " 
The UK 's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said on Wednesday it was " fully investigating " those two cases . 
Yet " it likely is an unusual and rare effect but clearly everyone now is aware of that and will be looking at that -- and particularly taking care of people who do have underlying allergic phenomenon , that they may be cautious about vaccination or at least be prepared to respond with some sort of anecdote to the reaction , " Fauci said . 
Fauci added : " If I were a person that had an underlying allergic tendency , I might want to be prepared that I might get a reaction and therefore be ready to treat it . "
