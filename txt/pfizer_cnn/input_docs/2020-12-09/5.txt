Paul Ostrowski — who serves as the deputy chief of supply , production and distribution for Operation Warp Speed — said on Wednesday that within 24 hours of emergency use authorization , " we will begin moving the vaccines . " 
As for how quickly they will get to the jurisdictions and people will begin getting vaccinated , Ostrowski said that the intent is to get the trucks moving within 24 hours and " then overnight , basically overnight , within 48 hours the vaccines have arrived at the locations that they ’ve been designated by the jurisdictions , and the administration of the vaccine can occur immediately afterward . " 
Remember : There has not been a vaccine approved in the US yet , but the FDA 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is set to meet tomorrow to discuss Pfizer ’s application for an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine .
