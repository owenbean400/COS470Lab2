" We have been advised by MHRA [ Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] of two yellow card reports that may be associated with allergic reaction due to administration of the COVID 19 BNT162b2 vaccine , " Pfizer said in a statement Wednesday . 
The statement concluded : " In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial , this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent Data Monitoring Committee . 
The trial has enrolled over 44,000 participants to date , over 42,000 of whom have received a second vaccination . " 
The two health workers – who both carried an adrenaline auto injector and had a history of allergic reactions – developed symptoms of anaphylactoid reaction after receiving the vaccine on Tuesday .
