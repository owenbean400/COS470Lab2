UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says it â€™s estimated that fewer than 10,000 people per day are currently being infected with coronavirus , lower than during the first wave which struck the country earlier this year . 
The United Kingdom reported 6,178 new daily cases of Covid 19 on Wednesday -- which is a similar number to the peak of the first wave of infections . 
The difference , Hancock says , is that there is significantly more testing being carried out now . 
According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University , more than 412,000 cases of coronavirus have been detected in the UK so far , putting it among the worst hit European countries , behind France and Spain . 
Almost 42,000 people have died as a result of the virus in the UK .
