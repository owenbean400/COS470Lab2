Spain recorded 184 new coronavirus related deaths in the past day , taking the country ’s total death toll to 27,104 , the Spanish Health Ministry said Wednesday . 
The 0.7 % increase in the death toll is the same as the percentage rise recorded on Tuesday , and in line with others recorded over the past week . 
Spain has a total of 228,691 confirmed cases so far , with the daily increase calculated by the government holding steady at 0.2 % for each of the last three days . 
Spain ’s Director of Health Emergencies , Dr . Fernando Simón , was asked at the government ’s daily coronavirus briefing about the guidance for wearing masks , amid reports they might become obligatory in all public places in Spain , and not just on public transport , which is already the rule . 
Simón said masks are a " good prevention measure " and that " the best masks are the two meters of distance , " or six feet , in support of continued social distancing measures . 
But he deferred to the government regarding any final decision about the masks . 
Spain , which for weeks had been the country with the second highest total confirmed cases of coronavirus in the world , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally , has now dropped to third , behind Russia . 
Both are behind the United States , which has the most cases .
