Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez asked Spaniards on Saturday to remain strong , as new cases and the number of deaths due to novel coronavirus are expected to increase in the coming days and weeks . 
Speaking from the Presidential Palace La Moncloa in Madrid , Sanchez said the worst is to yet come . 
To strengthen Spain 's response to the crisis , Sanchez announced national production of masks , ventilators and tests will begin . 
Meanwhile , the government has bought 640,000 reliable ratified fast tests , and within the next few hours , Sanchez said 1.3 million masks will be handed to health personnel and patients . 
Earlier on Saturday , the Spanish government said approximately 15,000 tests were being administered daily , and that the government is working to acquire four robots to increase testing capacity to almost 80,000 tests a day . 
The statement said that it 's important to note that the number of tests do not equal the number of patients ; sometimes a single patient may require multiple testing for a proper diagnosis .
