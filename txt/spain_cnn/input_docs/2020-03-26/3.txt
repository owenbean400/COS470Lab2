Nine European leaders have sent a letter to the European Union calling for joint action to tackle the coronavirus . 
The leaders — including President Emmanuel Macron of France , Italy 's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , and the leaders of Spain , Ireland and Belgium — called for shared guidelines on ending any restrictions to avoid re importing the virus . 
The leaders also pledged their support for preserving the single market of the European Union . 
They called for the EU to work on a common debt instrument to allow all EU countries to raise money on the same basis . 
European leaders are due to hold a video conference today to discuss the crisis . 
Remember : This common debt , which is being called a corona bond by many in the markets , is controversial within the EU because it is seen as transferring money from wealthier members to countries with lots of debt . 
It has always been resisted by EU members such as Germany , Finland and the Netherlands .
