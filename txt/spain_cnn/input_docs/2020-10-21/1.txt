Spanish football giants FC Barcelona on Wednesday began the process of introducing new salary reductions for players and staff as the Covid 19 pandemic continues to have a crippling effect on the club ’s finances . 
It comes after Barca had imposed a temporary pay cut of 70 % on the playing squad earlier this year to support the club ’s non playing employees during Spain ’s State of Emergency . 
It added that the club is anticipating a drop in revenue of more than 30 % for the coming year and is therefore " obliged to find immediate solutions to reduce expenditure . " 
The club announced on Tuesday that goalkeeper Marc Andre ter Stegen , defenders Clement Lenglet and Gerard Pique and midfielder Frenkie de Jong have already agreed to a " temporary salary adjustment " as part of their respective contract extensions .
