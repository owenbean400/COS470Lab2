Mortality rates in Spain were 55 % higher than usual between March 10 and May 10 of this year , Spain ’s top coronavirus health ministry official said Wednesday . 
However , only 27,118 of those additional deaths are linked to Covid 19 . 
A " significant part " of the more than 43,000 deaths between March 10 and May 10 " cannot directly connect to Covid 19 yet , " cautioned Simón . 
" If we count the deaths with coronavirus and compare it with the excess , there 's still a significant number of deaths left that could be explained for several reasons , " he added . 
Among those reasons , could be an inability or unwillingness to go to a hospital or get medical assistance during the peak of the coronavirus outbreak , Simón said . 
" We may have also witnessed some complications in some health centers that did not favor survival during a longer period for some of our elderly , " he added . 
A number of senior care homes in Spain reported unusually high mortality numbers during the height of the pandemic , but most of the deceased were not tested for Covid 19 . 
The numbers are emerging now , Simón said , because the country was under strict lockdown during the height of the epidemic , and notifications of deaths may have been delayed due to registry workers not being able to go to their offices , leaving many deaths tallied without a detailed analysis .
