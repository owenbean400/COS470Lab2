Spain has reported 18 new cases of the coronavirus overnight , bringing its total number to 32 , according to the health ministry . 
Twenty nine of those cases have a direct link to known risk zones in other countries , the ministry 's emergencies coordinator , Fernando Simon , told reporters Friday . 
But where the three other patients contracted the virus is unknown , he said , as they had not recently travelled to affected areas . 
Meanwhile , 130 guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife will be allowed to leave today after several days on lockdown , Simon said . 
Those guests had no contact with four people who have tested positive at the hotel . 
" Apart from that group there is a group of 500 people who might have had casual contact with the infected patients -- not a close contact -- who have no symptoms . 
They need to be monitored but they do not have to be isolated . 
We need to make a decision regarding those . 
They are mostly foreigners and we need to work with their governments to arrange their exit , this is not as easy " , Simon said .
