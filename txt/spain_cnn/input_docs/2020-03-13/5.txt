US citizens are waving goodbye to Spain as the country declared a state of emergency and President Trump sharply restricted travel to the United States from more than two dozen European countries . 
After three days of quarantine measures , Madrid 's public transport was deserted , main roads were traffic free and department stores in the city center were almost empty . 
Schools , libraries and theaters were closed , with even outdoor playgrounds sealed off . 
Sarah Nagy and Graham Owen , from Montana , told CNN they were " thinking of leaving while we still can . " 
" Our parents back home think it will be the same there soon , they would like us around , " they added . 
Courtney Seeley , a 21 year old student from Boston , Massachusetts , who had been doing an internship in Madrid , told CNN at the airport : " I was calm until the school told us we had to go home , they even bought the flights for us , they were very expensive . 
" My parents are very worried , I hope to be able to come back soon and finish my internship . " 
James Donoghue , 21 , was studying in London and in Madrid visiting Seeley . 
" My school wrote to me saying we had to go back home and leave Europe so here we are trying to leave Spain , " he said . 
David and Lucenda Presnall , both 71 , told CNN their son had helped them change their tickets before the ban was announced , but they had heard others spending $ 1,400 to get out before Friday 's deadline . 
" We had a whole month planned in Spain , we had nine wonderful days , " said Lucenda , from St . Louis , Missouri . 
" Then we saw what is happening to Italy and thought the same would happen here . 
My son really wanted us to come back . 
" In Granada , where we were , people were not taking precautions , that worried us . " 
There have been more than 4,000 cases and 120 deaths in Spain . 
More than 62 countries have placed restrictions on flights from Spain , and Morocco suspended all air and sea travel to the country .
