CNN 's Richard Quest , reporting from London , joins CNN 's ongoing coronavirus town hall to discuss the new travel restrictions President Donald Trump announced yesterday . 
The restrictions will ban travel to the US from 26 European countries -- a group in Europe called the Schengen Area . 
The United Kingdom is not part of this group . 
These are the 26 European countries : Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Italy , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , The Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Sweden , and Switzerland . 
There 's no " back door " : The ban will be in effect for anyone who is transiting through the listed countries , not just arriving from them , said Quest -- meaning , for instance , someone in Paris could not travel to London and then go to the US . 
" You will risk making an error , making a telling a false statement to immigration and that has serious consequences , " Quest warned . 
US citizens in Europe are allowed to fly back : But the process is still unclear at the moment . 
Americans currently in Europe will need to go to designated airports to fly back , but it 's unclear whether they will immediately self isolated once they arrive , or whether that may only apply to symptomatic people .
