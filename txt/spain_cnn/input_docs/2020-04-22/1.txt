The majority of nurses in Spain say they have been working during the Covid 19 crisis without enough protective equipment , according to a study by the Spanish College of Nursing ( CGE ) . 
Of the 11,000 nurses surveyed across Spain , 74 % said there were no masks in their work unit and 55 % reported a lack of protective gowns . 
However , the Spanish College of Nursing believes there are many more cases among health workers than have been reported , as the study reveals two thirds of nurses reported having symptoms but were not able to get tested . 
The report also reveals 5 % of nurses had to work with symptoms . 
Madrid , the hardest hit by the virus of Spain â€™s 17 regions , was also the region with the most number of nurses who reported having symptoms compatible with Covid 19 . 
In a lengthy report about Covid 19 , the Ministry of Health said " the high contagion rate among health care workers could be attributed to different factors . " 
In the initial phase especially when there was less knowledge about how the virus was transmitted , the report said , cases " could have been generated among health care workers improperly protected . " 
The College of Nursing study also reveals that many workers said they did not receive enough Covid 19 specific training to treat infected patients or use the special protective equipment . 
Some nurses also reported receiving " poor quality " supplies , such as having to reuse or wash masks and gowns , spending up to 14 hours with the same equipment , and reusing it the next day .
