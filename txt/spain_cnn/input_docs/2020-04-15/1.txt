Cycling ’s most famous race , the Tour de France , has been postponed until late August due to the coronavirus pandemic , the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) said on Wednesday . 
It will now run from Saturday August 29 to Sunday September 20 . 
The move means the prestigious race will not take place in its traditional June to July slot for the first time since it restarted after World War II . French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that no large scale public events would take place in the country until mid July , as part of measures to contain the outbreak . 
" Holding this event in the best conditions possible is judged essential given its central place in cycling ’s economy and its exposure , in particular for the teams that benefit on this occasion from unparalleled visibility , " the UCI said in a statement . 
Tour organisers have said that the event will follow the same route as originally planned , from Nice to Paris , and that an agreement had been reached with all the different parties involved , from local communities to public authorities . 
Along with the Giro d ’Italia and Vuelta a España , the Tour de France makes up cycling 's prestigious three week long " Grand Tours " . 
The UCI added that Italy 's Giro and Spain 's Vuelta would follow the Tour in a revised calendar , with dates yet to be confirmed . 
The UCI Road World Championships in Martigny , Switzerland , will go ahead as scheduled from Sunday 20 – Sunday 27 September .
