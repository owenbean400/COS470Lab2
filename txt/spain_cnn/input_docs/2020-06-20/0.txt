Travelers coming to Spain from Britain will no longer have to quarantine starting on June 21 , Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told the BBC on Saturday . 
The decision was made " out of respect " for the 400,000 Britons who have second homes in Spain , Laya said . 
However , Spain will continue to apply a " triple check , " including verifying the origin of passengers , a temperature check and registration so contact tracing can be possible , she added . 
Laya also said Spain is still discussing with United Kingdom authorities whether they will offer the same conditions for Spanish visitors to the UK . 
Currently , the UK imposes a 14 day self isolation for all passengers entering the country .
