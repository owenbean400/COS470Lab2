Spain has recorded its second consecutive daily increase in the number of deaths from coronavirus following a week long decline , according to data from the Health Ministry released Wednesday . 
Figures show 757 people died in the past 24 hours , an increase from 743 deaths recorded the previous day . 
However it was only a 5.5 % in relation to the total number of deaths , a slight slowdown compared to Tuesday ’s 5.7 % rise on the total . 
According to the Health Ministry 14,555 people have now died from the novel coronavirus in Spain . 
The number of active cases has also gone up from 83,504 to 84,111 , an increase of 610 , which is the lowest in nearly a month . 
Percentage wise , there was a growth of 0.7 % on Tuesday ’s numbers , the lowest since the outbreak began . 
The Health Ministry also reported 48,021 people have now recovered from the virus , 4,813 more than the number reported Tuesday . 
Spanish officials did not report the number of patients in intensive care ( ICU ) , the first time this has been left out since reporting began . 
This is because the Health Ministry wants all of Spain 's 17 regions to report the accumulated cases of such patients , but it says that five regions have been reporting only the current number of patients in ICU rather than the accumulated number . 
The Ministry said it would report the ICU figures again once all regions are reporting them the same way .
