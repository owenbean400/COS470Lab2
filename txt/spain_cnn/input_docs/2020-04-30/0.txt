The Spanish economy contracted by 5.2 % in the first quarter of the year , mainly due to a sharp decline in March , when coronavirus infections prompted a nationwide state of emergency and lockdown . 
The service sector was hardest hit , with cultural businesses like cinemas and theaters especially impacted -- falling 11.2 % -- while commerce , transport and hospitality dropped 10.9 % . 
The quarterly report relies on weekly data from the first three months of the year , with the government imposed lockdown affecting only the final two weeks of the first quarter . 
The national lockdown was extended until May 9 for a total of eight weeks , suggesting the negative impact on the Spanish economy could be even deeper when data for the second quarter is released in the summer .
