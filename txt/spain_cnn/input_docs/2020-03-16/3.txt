Borders between Spain and Portugal will be closed by the end of Monday , leaving only nine active crossings open to allow for the transit of products and workers who are required to cross the border , Portugal ’s Minister of Internal Affairs Eduardo Cabrita said today at a news conference . 
According to Cabrita , the decision – which was made jointly by authorities in Spain and Portugal – will see continued coordination between the two countries to ensure that the flow of essential goods will not be affected . 
Portugal ’s Minister of Internal Affairs added that officials will also be enforcing new controls at airports , with temperature checks on all passengers . 
The new measures come as part of a wider look at air operations between Spain and Portugal , with upcoming talks between Cabrita and his Spanish counterpart expected to focus on a potential ban on incoming flights from Spain .
