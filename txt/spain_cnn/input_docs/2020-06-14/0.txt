Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has announced his country will reopen its borders to people from other European Union countries – with the exception of Portugal - on June 21 . 
" From then the obligation for travelers who enter our country to quarantine will disappear , " Sánchez said at a press conference on Sunday in Madrid . 
The delay for reopening borders with Portugal was at the request of the Portuguese government , according to Sánchez . 
He also said external borders would not reopen until after June 30 , and a list of " safe countries " would be drawn up for which restrictions would be lifted from July 1 . 
Spain is currently in a state of Emergency , closed to tourists , and international arrivals have to undergo a 14 day quarantine . 
The lifting of restrictions for other EU members will coincide with the end of the State of Emergency in the country . 
Some other EU countries , including France , are due to lift border restrictions with countries in the European Union on Monday June 15 .
