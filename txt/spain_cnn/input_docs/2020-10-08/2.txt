Utah ranchers have lost at least 8,000 mink to an outbreak of Covid 19 among the animals known for their silky , luxurious pelts . 
The virus first appeared in the creatures in August , shortly after farmworkers fell ill in July , according to Dr . Dean Taylor , state veterinarian of Utah . 
Initial research shows the virus was transmitted from humans to animals , and so far has not seen any cases of the opposite . 
" It feels like a unidirectional path , " he said , adding that testing is still underway . 
Some context : This is the first outbreak among mink in the United States , though other cases have been detected in the Netherlands , Spain and Denmark , according to the US Department of Agriculture . 
Mink , which are closely related to weasels , otter and ferrets , appear to suffer similar symptoms to humans . 
Difficulty breathing and crusting around the eyes are usually seen , but the virus progresses rapidly , and most infected mink are dead by the next day , according to Taylor . 
It ’s unclear what makes mink such a susceptible species , while others appear to be unaffected . 
Mink join only cats , dogs , a tiger and a lion to be the only confirmed animals with Covid 19 in the US , according to the USDA data . 
The cluster of cases in Utah has spread to nine farms , but Taylor warns that " we ’re still in the middle of the outbreak . " 
Each farm is under quarantine with only essential workers permitted on site . 
Farmworkers are being directed to use proper protective equipment at all times . 
The pelts from most of the mink that have died from the virus have been either contained and buried or incinerated . 
No pelts have left the state , according to Taylor .
