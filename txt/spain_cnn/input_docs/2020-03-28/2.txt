Spanish health officials have expressed cautious optimism that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in the country is in sight . 
Simón pointed to figures showing slight declines in the percentage increase of fatalities , even as the actual number continues to rise . 
" Unfortunately , there is still an increase in deaths . 
But it is true that the evolution over time remains more or less in what has been observed in recent days , " he said . 
" According to various indicators , the disease is stabilizing . 
Although they are preliminary data , in some areas of the country the peak may have been reached , although at the national level we cannot confirm anything . " 
Simón warned that the pressure on intensive care units would worsen . 
Patients infected today , he said , may need an ICU bed within the next seven to ten days . 
The peak need may come in the next week , he said . 
By the numbers : At the same briefing , Patricia Lacruz , a senior official in Spain ’s National Health and Pharmacy System , said that more than 1.5 million masks would be distributed this weekend . 
Over the last two days , several flights have arrived in Spain carrying personal protective equipment for health service workers . 
On trials for the treatment of coronavirus , María Jesús Lamas Díaz , director of the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products , said 4,000 people would participate in authorized trials over the next few weeks .
