Only 5 % of people in Spain have developed coronavirus antibodies so far , according to preliminary results of an epidemiological study by the government , which were announced on Wednesday evening . 
The study also revealed that 87 % of all participants who have tested positive using the PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) for Covid 19 had developed antibodies . 
The preliminary results of the study show the prevalence of antibodies is higher in people who said they had more than five symptoms of coronavirus ( 14.7 % ) than in people who said they had just three to five symptoms ( 8 % ) . 
The study still has two more rounds of tests to conduct . 
" Those people that reported a sudden loss of sense of smell , among them the prevalence [ of antibodies ] was 43 % . 
Overall , of all positives we found in the study , 26 % are people with no symptoms " , Pollán added . 
Pollán also said the study detected a five times bigger presence of antibodies in the populations of the territories with the most coronavirus cases , such as in Spain ’s capital Madrid , compared to areas with fewer cases . 
The data also shows the level of antibodies was very " similar in men and women " and among adults . 
The study is based on 60,983 participants , who are a representative sample of the population . 
They are split into two groups across Spain for the search of antibodies . 
Spain , one of the hardest hit countries in the world by coronavirus , has been under a state of emergency since March 14 . 
As infection rates have declined , the government is slowly lifting strict home confinement , in some parts of the country . 
It is looking to this study to help guide its future re opening of activities and the economy , officials have said .
