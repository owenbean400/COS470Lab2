Spain will start easing lockdown restrictions starting Monday , the country 's Health Minister and a top aide announced Thursday . 
" From Monday , around 70 % of the Spanish population , or 32 million people will be in phase two . 
Around 30 % of the population or 15 million people will be in phase one and 45,000 people will be in phase three , " Spain ’s Health Minister Salvador Illa said at a news conference . 
At the start of this week , just over half of the population was still on the more restrictive phase one . 
Parts of the regions of Castilla , Valencia , Catalonia , Murcia , Andalucia and Castilla and Leon will move to phase two , which allows meetings of up to 15 people who do not live together , some restaurant service indoors , and the opening of stores , cinemas and museums but with occupancy limits . 
Four small islands in Spain 's Balearic and Canary Islands with small populations and low infection risk will advance to phase three , with further restrictions on movement and gatherings eased . 
The Madrid region , which includes Spain ’s capital and surrounding cities , will remain in phase one without any changes , the health officials explained . 
" All of this evolution is due to the effort made by the population and the health system to control this epidemic , " said Dr . Fernando Simón , Spain ’s director of the Center for Health Emergencies . 
Simón also told reporters that " small re emergences " have been identified very quickly and are being closely monitored by local authorities to " avoid a new outbreak and maintain this favorable tendency . "
