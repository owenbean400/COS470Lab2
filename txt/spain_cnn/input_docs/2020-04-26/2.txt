Children in Spain had their first taste of freedom on Sunday after a state of emergency was imposed on March 14 , bringing some of the strictest confinement measures in Europe in response to the coronavirus outbreak . 
Children enjoying the outdoors chirped " bien , " which means good , when asked by CNN how they felt about being able to walk outside their homes in the capital , Madrid . 
The government announced this week that from Sunday kids up to the age of 14 will now be able to play outside for one hour a day while accompanied by an adult . 
They are not allowed to venture further than one kilometer ( 0.62 miles ) from their home , but are able to bring out their toys to play . 
This sliver of normality brought some smiles to Madrid 's streets . 
Nine year old Lucia Ibanez told CNN that she missed " the streets and the park " the most during lockdown .
