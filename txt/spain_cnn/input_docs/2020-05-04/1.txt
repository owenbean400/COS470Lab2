Some businesses will start to reopen in Spain on Monday as the country starts " Phase Zero " of loosening coronavirus restrictions . 
Following eight weeks of strict confinement since a countrywide state of emergency was declared on March 14 , the process of transition in Spain will be gradual . 
The four phases will be determined by a " series of indicators , such as the strategic capacities available in the health care system , " officials say . 
Some of these indicators include being able to test and identify sources of contagion and the ability to isolate and control those sources . 
Spain 's health ministry said another key to reopening the economy is the availability of hospital beds . 
For every 10,000 residents , hospitals have to be able to add between 1.5 to 2 intensive care unit beds , and between 37 to 40 beds for severely ill patients , as outlined by the ministry . 
Across Spain , masks will be mandatory on public transport as of Monday . 
Here are some of the reopening guidelines for businesses : Hotel and restaurant terraces will be able to operate at 50 % of capacity , but will have to clean and disinfect tables , chairs , and other surfaces , between clients . 
Small retail and commercial businesses will be open to the public at 30 % capacity , and will offer priority service to people over 65 . 
Clothing stores will be required to disinfect fitting areas , and " hygiene any garment before other clients have access to it . " 
Businesses are responsible for providing personal protective equipment to their employees .
