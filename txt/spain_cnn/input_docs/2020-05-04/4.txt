Germany 's border checks will continue until at least next Friday , May 15 , the Interior ministry said . 
Germany is part of the European open border Schengen area , which imposed emergency border checks to contain the spread of the coronavirus . 
The group of 26 European countries — including Spain , France , Greece , Germany , Italy and Poland — do not have internal borders and usually allow people to move between them freely . 
The ministry said the extension of the border checks is in line with the EU commission .
