Sweden has not reported any deaths from Covid 19 for more than a week , data from the country â€™s Public Health Agency shows . 
According to the Swedish Public Health Agency 's data last updated on Monday , the last fatality was recorded on Aug . 23 . 
In the past 24 hours , the country has reported 43 new Covid 19 cases . 
Sweden has been seen as an outlier in the way it has handled the pandemic because of its seemingly relaxed approach , which imposed only light restrictions on daily life compared to other European nations . 
In total , the country has reported 5,808 deaths from the novel coronavirus , which corresponds to 576.38 deaths per million . 
This is more than the United States ( 553.07 ) , but less than other European countries where the death toll has also been high , such as Spain ( 620.49 ) , the United Kingdom ( 611.3 ) or Italy ( 586.77 ) , according to information from research platform Our World in Data , which is based at the University of Oxford . 
Sweden , however , has a much lower population density than all of these Covid 19 hotspots . 
The number of deaths per million in the country is much higher than some of its closest neighbors , with similar low population densities , namely Denmark ( 107.73 ) , Finland ( 60.46 ) , Norway ( 48.7 ) or Estonia ( 48.25 ) . 
Remember : Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said Sweden should not be America 's model for pandemic response . 
In an op ed for The Wall Street Journal on Sunday , Gottlieb wrote that the United States should continue focusing on containing the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid 19 .
