The World Health Organization 's Europe Director , Hans Kluge , said he is " very worried " about the second wave in Europe , but warned against imposing national lockdowns as cases surge in the region . 
Instead Kluge told CNN mask wearing , together with strict control on social gatherings , could save around 281,000 lives in Europe over six months . 
" The national lockdown is the last resort , " Kluge said , explaining that in March it was the default position but now " we know much better " . 
New cases of the coronavirus are accelerating rapidly in much of Europe , and now far exceed the rise in new cases in the United States , according to data from Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) and the World Health Organization . 
The five European countries currently most affected by the pandemic are France , the UK , Russia , Spain and the Netherlands . 
Kluge said WHO Europe is calling for " local , targeted , proportional measures " that involve engaging with communities and avoiding collateral damage socially and economically . 
The idea of short , sharp " circuit breaker " lockdowns has been mooted in some countries , including the UK . 
Kluge said government â€™s should consider their social impact , including mental health and domestic violence before implementing , and the two or three week time period should be used to " buy time " to get an effective track and trace system in place .
