Spain lost thousands of jobs in the first quarter of the year , most of them in March , when rapidly increasing coronavirus infections prompted the government to declare a nationwide state of emergency and lockdown on March 14 that brought most businesses to an abrupt standstill . 
The country ’s active workforce shrank by 285,600 people in the first quarter , Spain ’s National Statistics Institute reported on Tuesday . 
The unemployment rate rose to 14.4 % , up from 13.8 % in the fourth quarter of 2019 . 
The number of newly jobless was listed at just 121,000 . 
But the Statistics Institute said " inactive " workers increased by 257,000 in the first quarter and " it 's probable that many workers who lost their jobs were listed as ' inactive ' " rather than unemployed . 
The government imposed lockdown affected only the final two weeks of the quarter , and the lockdown has been extended until May 9 , suggesting job losses could increase further when data for the second quarter is released this summer . 
The Statistics Institute said the jobless figures also do not show workers who are on a " temporary " layoff of up to three months on a government backed benefit program , collecting up to 80 % of their salaries . 
The Socialist government has said repeatedly that it wants to avoid the mistakes of the 2008 financial crisis , which hit Spain hard . 
It has ordered that companies cannot use coronavirus as an excuse to fire workers . 
But it 's unclear when Spain 's tourism sector , accounting for 12.3 % of GDP and 12.7 % of employment according to the Statistics Institute , will be able to re open for business .
