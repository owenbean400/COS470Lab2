England registered the highest excess death rate in Europe for the first six months of 2020 , according to a report published Thursday by the UK â€™s Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) . 
The report -- which compared " all cause mortality rates " across Europe with the five year average -- indicated that " while England did not have the highest peak mortality , it did have the longest continuous period of excess mortality of any country compared . " 
" Of the four nations of the UK [ England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland ] , England had the highest peak excess mortality ( 107.6 % in week ending April 17 ) , " the report reads . 
He said that while most Western European countries had very localized outbreaks , as seen in the worst hit areas of Italy and Spain , excess mortality was widespread in the UK . 
The province of Bergamo , the hardest hit by coronavirus in Italy , saw excess deaths about 9.5 times higher than expected during the peak of the pandemic . 
" The closest UK region would be the London borough of Brent , which is broadly equivalent , which saw rates at about 4.5 times what we 'd normally expect to see , " Humberstone told the BBC . 
The ONS looked also at major cities and found that " the highest peak excess mortality was in Madrid at 432.7 % ( week ending March 27 ) while in the UK , Birmingham had the highest peak excess mortality of any major British city at 249.7 % . "
