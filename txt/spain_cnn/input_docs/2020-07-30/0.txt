The UK is expected to extend the self isolation period for people showing possible Covid 19 symptoms , as concerns grow over a second wave of infections in Europe . 
Speaking to Sky News Thursday , UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock stopped short of confirming that the self isolation period would be extended from seven to 10 days , but said the country â€™s Chief Medical Officer would be announcing details later in the day and that the decision was " clinically led . " 
Second wave : Hancock said he is worried about a second wave in Europe and that the UK " wo not hesitate to act " to boost quarantine measures if needed . 
He added that the UK government is keeping the quarantine rules " under review all of the time , and we are taking action and we will take action if it is needed to keep this country safe . " 
Quarantine testing : Hancock said the UK government is considering using testing to shorten the quarantine period imposed on travelers returning to England from countries such as Spain . 
" We are working on whether by testing people during that quarantine it is safe to then be able to release them earlier . 
But we are not imminently making an announcement on it because that work is not concluded , " Hancock told the BBC . 
Hancock also raised concerns about the risk of an increase of coronavirus cases in the UK . 
" Of course there 's a danger of an increase and we 've all seen what this virus can do and how fast it can move , " he told BBC radio , adding that new countries could be added to quarantine list in next few days .
