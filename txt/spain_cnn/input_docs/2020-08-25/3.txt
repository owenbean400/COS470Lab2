The president of Spain 's Madrid region , Isabel Díaz Ayuso , announced at a press conference on Tuesday the measures under which the education centers will open in the capital . 
Díaz Ayuso said masks will be mandatory for children from 6 years of age at all times while in the center . 
" This measure could be changed to 11 years of age if the situation in the region improved , " she added . 
She also explained that classes will be reduced to 20 pupils and that 11,000 new teachers will be hired to allow that ratio . 
All centers will be provided with disinfectant gel , thermometers and masks , and the cleaning procedures will be made more thorough . 
Díaz Ayuso added that 100.000 tests will be performed to centre 's personnel . 
Catalonia 's President , Quim Torra , announced similar measures on Monday . 
He said children 12 years old and up in Catalonia will have to wear masks at school , and from the age of six in those territories with " higher risk of contagion . " 
Classes will also be reduced to 20 students and 500,000 tests will be carried out in Catalan schools and high schools . 
In Spain , the regional governments retain the responsibility and the decision power on education , as well as health , so each of the 17 regions will have to decide which measures they see fit for the schools and other educational centers to reopen in their territory .
