As just over half of Spain ’s population prepares to move ahead with the next step in de escalation on Monday , the latest figures on coronavirus cases indicate why the two largest cities , Madrid and Barcelona , will continue to enforce stricter movement and mobility measures for now , a top health official said Sunday . 
The Health Ministry reported at least 621 new Covid 19 cases across Spain since Saturday , and 64 % of them are in the Madrid region , in Catalonia – where Barcelona is located , and in two other regions adjacent to Madrid . 
Of the 143 new deaths reported since Saturday , 72 % of them were in the same four regions that Simón mentioned at the government ’s daily technical briefing and press conference . 
By the numbers : Overall , there are now at least 224,390 cases confirmed by PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) testing , and approximately 26,621 deaths from coronavirus , the Health Ministry reported . 
According to Simón , the latest increase in confirmed cases is 0.28 % , while the increase in deaths is 0.5 % , the lowest since early March , a continued weeks long decline for both categories . 
He said that in the two Castilla regions , their close contact to Madrid and frequent movement of people between the regions and the capital city have led to more cases in those two regions . 
The entire country remains under strict home confinement rules under a state of emergency that ’s just been extended through May 23 , for a total of 10 weeks .
