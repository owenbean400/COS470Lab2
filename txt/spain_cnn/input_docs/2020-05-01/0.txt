Drugs dealers are disguising themselves as food delivery drivers to continue dealing drugs , Interpol warns . 
Police in the UK , Ireland , Malaysia and Spain have reported instances of drug couriers posing as food delivery workers , while carrying illicit drugs such as cocaine , marijuana , ketamine and ecstasy , according to the international police organization . 
In April , police in Spain arrested seven men dressed as food delivery drivers delivering cocaine and marijuana by bicycle , motorcycle and car . 
The drugs were concealed in the false bottom of a food delivery backpack , the Interpol report said . 
In another case in Ireland , officers recovered 8 kilograms ( 17 ponds ) of cocaine as well as two handguns hidden in pizza boxes . 
" Legitimate food delivery drivers have also been used as unwitting drug mules , " said the organization , which coordinates data from 194 international police forces . 
" Criminals continue to adapt their activities to a world upended by Covid 19 , " said Stephen Kavanagh , Interpol â€™s Executive Director of Police Services .
