Only 5.2 % of people in Spain have developed coronavirus antibodies so far , according to interim results from an ongoing government study announced on Thursday evening . 
These results are consistent with those from the first phase of the study , which showed 5 % of people in the country had antibodies â€“ meaning they had been infected at some point . 
The second phase of the study took place between May 18 and June 1 . 
While it is still not clear if having antibodies means people are immune to reinfection , doctors believe they provide at least some immunity . 
Antibody testing also paints a picture of how much of the population has been infected so far . 
More on the study : The study indicates a very slightly lower percentage of men ( 5.01 % ) have antibodies than women ( 5.40 % ) . 
And although the national average is 5.21 % , the study shows geographical differences , also very similar to those observed in the first round , with 10 % of the population testing positive for antibodies both in Madrid and surrounding provinces . 
The government researchers also said one third of those infected do not show symptoms .
