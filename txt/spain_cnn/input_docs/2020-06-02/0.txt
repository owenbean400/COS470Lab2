Spain recorded a steep decrease in new unemployment claims in May , as the country emerged from coronavirus confinement measures that shuttered businesses across the nation and put hundreds of thousands of people out of work . 
There were 26,573 new jobless claims in May , far fewer than the increases of 282,891 in April and 302,265 in March , according to data released by Spain ’s Labor Ministry today . 
In a sign of modest economic improvement , the construction and manufacturing sectors recorded slight declines in jobless claims in May . There are now a total of 3,857,776 unemployed in Spain . 
However , this does not include another 3.7 million people using the government ’s " ERTE " temporary furlough scheme , during the coronavirus crisis , and who are not counted among the unemployed . 
ERTE is a legal mechanism allowing temporary layoffs during extraordinary events , such as the Covid 19 crisis .
