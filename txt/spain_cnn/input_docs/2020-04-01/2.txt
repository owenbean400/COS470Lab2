Spain is " effectively in a phase of stabilization , according to the data we have learned today , " Salvador Illa , minister of Health , said in a press conference in Madrid on Wednesday . 
Illa cited the increase in the total number of cases ( which includes deaths and recovered ) at 8 % as of today , the lowest percentage rise since Spain declared the state of emergency on March 14 . 
Illa said the new figure is down from the average 20 % rate recorded between March 15 and 25 and has been falling since . 
Speaking earlier at the Spanish government ’s daily coronavirus technical briefing , María José Sierra , an official from the country ’s center for health emergencies , said the lower numbers help " evaluate the measures we ’ve been taking very positively . " 
Sierra said there were around 6,000 ICU beds in the country after " a lot of mobilization " to increase ICU capacity . 
She added that in many communities " we are seeing less pressure on the ICUs . " 
Both Illa and Sierra urged caution , saying strict isolation measures need to continue . 
Spain ’s government has come under criticism from opposition parties , some health workers and unions for reported shortages of ICU facilities , lack of sufficient personal protective gear and overstretched health workers .
