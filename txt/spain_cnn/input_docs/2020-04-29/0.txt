Spain is working to ease restrictions in the country and officials defined what the " new normal " will look like as the number of new coronavirus cases continues to fall . 
Relaxation of Spain 's confinement measures , which have been Europe 's strictest , will be lifted gradually and in phases , Spain ’s Director for Health Emergencies Fernando Simón and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said . 
Small parts of the country will start phase one of easing restrictions on Monday , with the rest joining in May 11 . 
This phase will see some small businesses start operating and allow for individual exercise as well as professional sports training to resume . 
Senior citizens will also be permitted to go outside in ‘ Phase One ’ . 
Deescalation is expected to be complete by the end of June , according to the prime minister . 
When asked about the use of masks , Simón said in most cases , it is recommended , but not mandatory . 
" Not everyone can wear a mask . 
People with respiratory problems , with anxiety , athletes will not be able to use it , with children it ’s not easy " he explained . 
" A rule about the mandatory use of masks , with all these exceptions , is complicated , " he said . 
Spain is the country with the second highest number of coronavirus infections in the world , suffering from a great economic and social toll from the pandemic .
