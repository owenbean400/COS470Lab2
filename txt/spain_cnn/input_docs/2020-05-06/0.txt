The Spanish Parliament approved the extension of the country ’s state of emergency for a fourth time on Wednesday , continuing severe restrictions on movement and business until at least May 24 due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
The decision , approved by 178 votes against 75 and with 97 abstentions , came after Spain ’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez negotiated last minute votes to secure the extension , despite the main opposition Popular Party , PP , abstaining . 
The extension gives the Socialist Party led minority government the power to continue enforcing restrictions under the state of emergency rules decreed on March 14th . 
During the parliamentary debate ahead of the vote , opposition and right wing parties harshly criticized the socialist minority led government , accusing Sánchez of holding Spanish citizens " hostage " by curtailing fundamental rights . 
The Spanish prime minister said he will request 15 day extensions throughout the country ’s de escalation period , expected to last until the end of June . 
Most of Spain began " Phase Zero " of the government 's de escalation plan on Monday , by lifting some of the confinement restrictions to additional sectors of the work force to return to their jobs , such as restaurants for take away service , small stores and hair salons with clients by appointment only . 
It is expected that next Monday , some regions will advance to " Phase One " if they show infections rates are low and that their health facilities are able to react quickly to any new outbreaks . 
The government says the state of emergency during the de escalation plan is crucial . 
The state of emergency was first declared on March 14 and extended for the first time on March 27 .
