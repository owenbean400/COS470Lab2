New coronavirus cases brought into Spain from abroad could become one of the country ’s " greatest risks " , said Fernando Simón , Spain ’s Director of Health Emergencies . 
Simón was explaining the reasons behind the newly announced 14 day mandatory quarantine for international travelers arriving in Spain , starting on May 15th . 
Simón continued to explain " If a Spaniard living on the peninsula , for example , cannot go to their second residence , like in the Balearics , but another person living abroad can travel there by air , " then more logical norms have to be put in place , he said . 
The quarantine measures are similar to those in place in other European countries , Simón added . 
Spain registered 176 daily new deaths from Covid 19 on Tuesday , up from 123 new registered on Monday but still among the lowest daily death tolls since mid March . 
A total of 26,920 people have died from the virus in Spain , according to Health Ministry data released Tuesday . 
Speaking at a separate press conference , Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa said the possibility of a second wave of infections " ca not be dismissed " but added that the public 's compliance with the government ’s measures against the coronavirus is the best way to avoid this . 
Illa and Simón were among Spanish officials who paid tribute to nurses on International Nurses Day . 
Nurses are " one of the groups with the highest risk of infection " , Simón said Tuesday . 
Spain ’s Health Ministry reported a total of 48,860 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the start of the outbreak , while the General Council of Official Medical Colleges , the Spanish doctors ’ professional body ( CGCOM ) , said a " large number " had died , including 48 doctors .
