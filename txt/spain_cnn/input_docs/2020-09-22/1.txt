A live audience is always difficult to impress , perhaps even more so in the age of social distancing . 
An opera in Madrid was halted on Sunday night after audience members protested over concerns that seating was too crowded in the venue . 
The Teatro Real in Spain 's capital city was forced to cancel the performance of Giuseppe Verdi 's " Un ballo in maschera " after a group of spectators staged a protest during the performance , eventually ending the show and closing the venue for the night . 
Police officers were called to the site on Sunday . 
The venue said Monday that it " greatly regrets what happened " but attributed the upset to shifts in the city 's health regulations . 
In July , the theater hosted performances of another Verdi opera , " La Traviata , " and spaced out audience members by sealing off some chairs and placing empty chairs between each pair of occupied seats , it said . 
But it relaxed its seating policy after the city eased coronavirus restrictions , allowing some venues to host bigger audiences . 
On Sunday , the Teatro Real was at 65 % capacity , still below city guidelines that allow such venues to fill up to 75 % of normal capacity , it said . 
Audience members were allowed to freely choose their seats , though they wore masks during the performance .
