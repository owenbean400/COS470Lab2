There is no " silver bullet " on testing to allow British citizens to travel without potentially having to quarantine on return , UK Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said Wednesday . 
Dowden â€™s remarks come days after the UK government announced that it would remove Spain from its list of countries that residents can safely visit , sparking criticism from both the Spanish government and British travelers . 
" We have to act in a way to keep the virus under control in this country . 
It was rising in Spain , and we had to ensure that we did not import cases , " Dowden said . 
" If there are ways in which we can ease the burdens , we will do that , but at the moment the safest thing to do is for people to quarantine for 14 days if they are returning from Spain , " he added .
