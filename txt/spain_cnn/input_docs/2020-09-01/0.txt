Spain received 2.5 million international tourists in July , 75 % less than in the same month of 2019 , according to the country 's National Institute of Statistics . 
Spending was also down 17.8 % per tourist to € 994 ( or about$1,188 ) . 
The Secretary of State for Tourism , Fernando Valdés , explained that this " data reflects how COVID 19 is negatively affecting the tourism sector due to restrictions on international mobility and the lack of confidence in international travel , an impact that is being felt worldwide " . 
The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) said there was a " sluggish improvement " in passenger demand in Europe in July compared to June , but still toppled 87.1 % compared to last year . 
IATA called on governments to work together to re establish global connectivity and re open borders while continuing " with relief measures to sustain airlines during the COVID 19 crisis . " 
" This uncertainty destroys demand , " said IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac in a statement on Tuesday . 
" Ten percent of the global economy is sustained by travel and tourism ; governments need to do better to re start it . "
