The Spanish government said Saturday that it would further relax coronavirus restrictions in certain areas from Monday . 
Four islands will lead the way by embarking on phase 3 of the government 's de escalation plan , the government said . 
They are La Gomera , El Hierro and La Graciosa , in the Canaries , and Formentera , in the Balearic islands -- all well known tourist destinations in Spain . 
Phase 3 seeks to allow a transition into relatively normal activities , including attending cinemas , theaters , restaurants and circuses , as long as establishments limit capacity . 
People may sit by the bar and there wo not be time restrictions by age group any more . 
However , most of the islands in both archipelagos will remain on phase 2 , together with 70 % of mainland Spain , which is expected to remain on phase 2 until June 8 . 
Some relaxation of measures was announced Saturday for those regions under phase 2 : indoor sporting venues are allowed to open at very limited capacity with rigorous hygiene protocols . 
Swimming pools may open at very limited capacity , with a two meter requirement between swimmers . 
The government also offered some respite for a number of regions still under phase 1 , including capital city Madrid . 
Residents will be allowed visits to parks and restricted indoor sports activities . 
Open air terraces are also allowed to reopen but not at full capacity .
