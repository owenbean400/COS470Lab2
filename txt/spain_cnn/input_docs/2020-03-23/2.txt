The number of patients in ICU due to coronavirus has dropped from 15 % to 13 % in the last few days , health officials in Spain said on Monday . 
Although the decrease is " small , " it " gives some hope the problem is being contained , " said Fernando Simón , director of the Spanish Coordinating Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies . 
Simón said another " uplifting number " was the number of patients discharged — 3,355 — which now represents 10 % of all cases . 
He also gave some insight into the profile of those who have died from the virus : 87 % were older than 70 years old , " which was expected and goes in line with our country 's normal mortality rate " . 
" We know all groups can be affected , but the most affected one are the elderly with more than 70 years of age , which we expected " , he said .
