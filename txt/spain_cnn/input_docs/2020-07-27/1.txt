Holiday tour operator TUI is calling for a " regionalized policy " on UK quarantine rules , Managing Director Andrew Flintham told the BBC â€™s Radio 4 on Monday . 
On Saturday , the UK government unexpectedly announced all people returning from Spain would be required to self isolate for two weeks , reversing its previous stance with immediate effect . 
The abrupt reversal followed a rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Spain , where authorities reported more than 900 new infections on both Thursday and Friday . 
Following the decision from the British government , TUI said in a statement that it would be canceling " all holidays to mainland Spain " until August 9 . 
On Monday , Flintham acknowledged the government is " rightly nervous . " 
" If there are areas where the infection rates are lower and therefore safe travel can go ahead , we would look to have a consistent approach to mean the quarantine would not apply to those places , " Flintham said . 
Flintham also spoke about the travel industry as a whole and warned of the difficulties often experienced during the winter season , acknowledging they need " every single piece of help we can get from the government . "
