The UK government is monitoring the coronavirus situation in Germany and France " closely " as it continues to review the travel bridges to many popular holiday destinations , a junior health minister said Monday . 
" We have to keep the situation under review and I think that is what the public would expect us to do , " Helen Whately told Sky News , when asked specifically about reports that Germany and France could follow Spain ’s sudden removal from the UK ’s allowed travel bridge list . 
" If we see rates going up in a country where at the moment there is no need to quarantine , if we see the rates going up , we would have to take action because we cannot take the risk of coronavirus being spread again across the UK , " Whately said . 
UK reverses Spanish travel corridor : On Saturday , the UK government unexpectedly announced that all people returning from Spain would be required to self isolate for two weeks , reversing its previous stance with immediate effect . 
The abrupt reversal followed a rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Spain , where authorities reported more than 900 new infections on both Thursday and Friday . 
Asked about the decision to remove Spain from the UK travel bridges list , Whately said Monday that people " should be aware that we are in a situation of global pandemic . " 
" We put in place the travel bridges because people wanted to be able to travel but we did say at the time that we had to keep it under review and that ’s exactly what we ’ve done with Spain and what we saw with Spain was a very rapid increase in the rate of coronavirus cases and we had to take rapid action , " Whately added .
