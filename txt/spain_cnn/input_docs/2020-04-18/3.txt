Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says his government plans to extend Spain ’s state of alarm for 15 more days . 
The state of alarm was to end on April 26 , but the planned extension calls for it to end on May 9 . 
The plan extends Spain ’s strict lockdown to a total of eight weeks . 
" Today it is not possible to lift the containment measures and go to phase two of de escalation , " Sanchez said at a news conference . 
The state of alarm was introduced March 14 and placed severe restrictions on movement and business . 
The extension will be presented to Parliament in the coming week . 
However , Sanchez said with the advice of experts , the government will lift the confinement of children as of April 27 . 
He said the exception would " be limited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion . " 
Sanchez said after May 9 , a " cautious and progressive " de escalation would take place . 
" We will be guided by a series of markers that will tell us of the spread of the virus and of the vigor of our health system , so that we know how the pandemic is evolving in each region , " he said . 
The de escalation may proceed at different rates in different regions , he said . 
But if any risk is detected , Sanchez said the de escalation would be suspended . 
The state of alarm was slightly relaxed last Monday to allow some four million Spaniards to return to work in jobs like construction and manufacturing . 
But nonessential retail outlets , bars , cafes and other places of entertainment have remained closed , and Spain ’s lucrative tourism business remains halted . 
The National Police and Civil Guard continue to enforce a ban on all nonessential movement , and traffic on Spain ’s major roads is down by about 80 % on pre crisis levels .
