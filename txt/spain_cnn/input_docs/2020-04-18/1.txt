More than 20,000 people have now died in Spain as a result of the coronavirus pandemic , according to official figures issued Saturday by the Ministry of Health . 
The number of reported deaths , at 20,043 , was up 565 from the number recorded Friday . 
The percentage rise , at 2.9 % , is roughly in line with most of the daily results of the last week . 
Spanish authorities have warned that the data may fluctuate as a new system for reporting cases comes into play and as testing throughout the country is increased . 
Earlier this week , the region of Catalonia revised the reported cases and deaths from coronavirus sharply upwards , after adopting a new formula for calculating the impact of the pandemic . 
Among those who have died from coronavirus in the past 24 hours was one of Spain â€™s most prominent doctors , Jesus Vaquero . 
Vaquero was head of neurosurgery at the Puerta del Hierro Hospital in Madrid , and a leading specialist in back surgery .
