Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has asked the European Council for a concrete financial plan to overcome the novel coronavirus pandemic . 
The European Council is a collective body that helps to shape the European Union 's overall priorities . 
Sanchez demanded the council provide " a clear and compelling financial commitment to overcome the crisis , " including " concrete proposals for medium and long term financing , " according to a statement from the Spanish government . 
On Thursday , EU member states gathered on an extraordinary G20 video conference on COVID 19 to discuss a shared front in dealing with the socio economic impact of the pandemic . 
Italy and Spain , however , refused to sign the EU 's joint response to COVID 19 after they disagreed with the economic proposals put forward during Thursday 's leadership summit , a spokesperson for the European Council told CNN . 
" Spain and Italy had problems with the parts of the statement tackling social economic consequences , " the spokesperson said . 
The EU agreed to come back with a new proposal in two weeks , according to the Spanish press note . 
This week , Sanchez and eight other European leaders sent a letter to the President of the European Council , Charles Michel , explaining " the need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European institution " to benefit all member states on the same basis with long term finance policies to counteract the damage caused by the pandemic .
