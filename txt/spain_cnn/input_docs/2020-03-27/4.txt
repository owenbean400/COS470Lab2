A Chinese government regulatory group said on Friday it has launched an investigation into Covid 19 test kit maker which supplied test kits to Spain that were recalled . 
On Thursday , the Spanish government said it was recalling 9,000 kits after finding the results to be " unreliable . " 
The tests , made by the Chinese company " Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology " were bought " some weeks ago " through a Spanish supplier that imported them from China , the Spanish government said in a statement sent to CNN . 
When the equipment was tested by Spanish authorities before being put into use , they did not meet quality levels . 
The Shenzhen Market Supervisions Administration said on its Weibo account Friday it has launched an investigation into Bioeasy . 
Bioeasy posted a statement on its We Chat account Friday to say that the nasopharyngeal swab samples might have been sampled , extracted and handled without strictly following the company 's instructions , reducing the accuracy of the tests . 
Bioeasy added that it did not communicate instructions well with customers .
