The partial lockdown and restrictive emergency measures in place in Germany will continue for a while , said German Chancellor Angela Merkel today . 
" Right now is not the time to be talking about the loosening of these measures , " she said . 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany is currently doubling about every 5 days , she said , adding that it needs to go down to every 10 days for a loosening of measures to even become an option . 
Financial fallout : After a G20 video conference call and an EU heads of state conference call , she also reiterated Germany 's position against Eurobonds , saying the European Stabilization Mechanism is the right instrument to deal with the financial fallout from the coronavirus crisis . 
" We made clear from the German side , but also others did as well , that this is not the opinion of all states , " Merkel said in reference to Spain and Italy 's desire to try new ways to deal with the crisis and asking for Coronabonds . 
Social distancing : Merkel added that while she is busy and working well in quarantine , she , like many German citizens , misses personal social contact . 
" I miss that I ca not be in the cabinet meetings and ca not see the people there . 
And I miss having personal contacts , " she said .
