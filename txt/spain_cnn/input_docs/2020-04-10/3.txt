The Spanish Government is working to introduce a preliminary version of a universal basic income as soon as possible , to help Spaniards face the economic fallout of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country . 
" This [ health ] crisis has placed on the table the urgency of a universal basic income , that it is essential and fundamental to guarantee dignity and a minimum purchase power for many Spanish families that are in a desperate situation , " the second deputy Spanish Prime Minister , Pablo Iglesias , said in an interview with national broadcaster TVE on Friday . 
" There are people who cannot take advantage of unemployment benefits or furloughs . 
There are people that have difficulties , today , to go to the supermarket and buy the essential products their family need . " 
" It is essential and fundamental to help families that are in a desperate situation , " Iglesias , who is also the Minister for Social Rights , added . 
According to reports in Spanish media , this temporary universal basic income would be of around $ 550 ( € 500 ) per month . 
Iglesias went on to say it could take a few months to implement a proper universal basic income system in a country such as Spain , which has different benefit systems across each region , so the government in Madrid will put forward plan that will serve as a " bridge " in the meantime . 
" This is an urgent matter that we in government are working on and that we hope we can implement as soon as possible , " Iglesias said . 
" This ‘ bridge ’ universal basic income is essential . " 
Spain has previously announced a € 200 billion ( $ 216 billion ) aid package , amounting to about 20 % of the country 's GDP , as it tackles the economic impact of its coronavirus outbreak -- the deadliest anywhere in Europe . 
The nation registered an increase in unemployment of 302,265 people in March compared to the previous month , according to Spanish Labor Ministry data .
