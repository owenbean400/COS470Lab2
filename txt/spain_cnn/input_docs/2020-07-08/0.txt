Scotland will lift the quarantine requirement for travelers arriving from the same countries on the British government â€™s exemption list , except for Serbia and Spain , Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced at a news conference Wednesday . 
Passengers who arrive in Scotland starting on July 10 , traveling from any of the 57 countries on the green and amber lists , which includes the likes of Germany and Norway , will not have to self isolate for 14 days . 
A key criteria for inclusion on the list was having a prevalence rate of coronavirus " below or not significantly higher than Scotland , " Sturgeon explained , adding that it was on this basis the government took the " difficult decision " to exclude Spain and Serbia from the ease of restrictions . 
Sturgeon cited Joint Bias Security Centre data which stated that Spain has a prevalence rate of 330 cases per 100,000 people , while the Scottish coronavirus prevalence rate currently stands at 28 cases for every 100,000 people . 
This compares to a whole UK rate of 180 per 100,000 people . 
Sturgeon said the Scottish Cabinet " cannot in good conscience at this stage lift restrictions for people arriving on Spain " and expressed her " concerns about Serbia " and its recent outbreak , which has prompted neighboring countries to close their borders . 
She affirmed that this decision is " evidence driven " and will be reviewed on July 20 . 
Some background : Last week , Spain and Scotland were both included in a list of countries whose travelers would be allowed into England without having to quarantine for 14 days . 
The United States was not on the list . 
The list , which comes into effect on July 10 , will open foreign travel to English vacationers after four months of lockdown , just in time for the peak travel period , provided there are no restrictions in place at the destinations .
