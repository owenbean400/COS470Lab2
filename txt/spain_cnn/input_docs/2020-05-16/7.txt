Hotels and some public spaces in Spain will be allowed to reopen by Monday , the Spanish government said . 
Saturday ’s government communiqué spelled out the how provinces , cities and autonomous regions are allowed to reopen business according to a classification system of " phases " outlined by the Health Ministry which is leading and guiding other government agencies in this transition period . 
Most of the nation will remain on phase one , meaning that gatherings may not include more than 10 people . 
Hotels and public spaces may open but with caveats , including limited occupancy and closed common areas . 
The biggest change comes for regions in Spain that will be classified as phase 2 . 
Sporting and outdoor activities will be allowed to take place freely except during hours reserved for the elderly . 
That includes the Balearic Islands of Formentera and La Graciosa , and La Gomera and El Hierro , two islands that are part of the Canary Islands . 
Densely populated areas , including the cities of Madrid and Barcelona , will remain under lockdown .
