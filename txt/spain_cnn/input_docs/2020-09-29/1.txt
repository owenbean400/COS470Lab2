The Netherlands , Iceland , Denmark and Hungary were added to list on Tuesday . 
The Netherlands has registered 2,921 new infections in the last 24 hours . 
The country introduced a series of additional measures to fight a second wave , including the closing of all bars and restaurants at 10 p.m . Iceland reported over 80 new infections during the weekend according to the ECDC , but given the country 's small population even the slightest increase in cases can have a significant impact on the infection rate .
