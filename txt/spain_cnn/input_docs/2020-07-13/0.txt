A Spanish judge has blocked the Catalan regional government ’s order to require home confinement as a way to contain the spread of Covid 19 in the provincial capital of Lleida and 7 nearby towns . 
The ruling , which came late Sunday , explained that the confinement was part of the state 's jurisdiction , and not the regional government 's . 
It added that the president of Catalonia " could ask the ( Spanish ) Government to declare a state of alarm . " 
The judge , an investigating magistrate in Lleida , noted that the state prosecutor had opposed the implementation of the Catalan government ’s stay at home order . 
The measure would have confined 156,000 people to their homes , with few exceptions , after Segría county -- including Lleida city -- tallied 1,438 new cases of Covid 19 . 
The cases have all been recorded since June 21 , when Spain 's state of emergency ended following three months of nationwide confinement . 
A week ago , Catalonia ordered Segría 's 200,000 residents to stay inside the county , which is a two hour drive from Barcelona . 
But as the outbreak kept spreading , authorities issued a home confinement order for the majority of people . 
Lleida 's Mayor , Miquel Pueyo , warned in a statement that home confinement would have " a huge economic and emotional impact on the territory , " and asked the Catalan government to " guarantee the salaries of the workers from outside Lleida who for 15 days would not be able to come to work in Lleida " because of the confinement order .
