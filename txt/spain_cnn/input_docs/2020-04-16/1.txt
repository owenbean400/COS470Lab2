Coronavirus lockdowns have played a role in causing pollution levels to drop significantly across Europe over the past month , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) has said . 
Nitrogen dioxide levels are down around 50 % in some cities , the agency said on Thursday , noting that the fall coincides with the " strict quarantine measures implemented across Europe . " 
The improvements in air quality were particularly clear in France , Spain and Italy , all of which have had severe lockdowns in place for several weeks . 
Paris saw a dramatic drop of 54 % in nitrogen dioxide concentrations when comparing the period April 13 to March 13 to the same time in 2019 . 
Madrid , Milan and Rome all saw decreases of around 45 % . 
Nitrogen dioxide concentrations vary widely day to day owing to the fluctuations of emissions , as well as variations in weather conditions , the agency also said , admitting there is a " weather induced variability , " which makes it difficult to " draw conclusions based only on daily or weekly measurements .
