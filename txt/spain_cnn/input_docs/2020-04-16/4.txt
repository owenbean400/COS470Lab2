The Spanish government announced they are putting in place a so called " minimum vital income " program starting in May to help more than a million households , according to a government statement Thursday . 
The program will be permanent , not temporary as originally envisioned , to help the hardest hit families through the coronavirus economic crisis . 
The plan is designed to help those not eligible for other forms of aid , such as unemployment benefits . 
The government estimates that among the more than a million households , which cannot meet basic needs , some 10 % are single parent families .
