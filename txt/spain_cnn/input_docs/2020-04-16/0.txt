The Spanish region of Catalonia may have twice the official number of deaths reported so far by the Spanish government , according to new data from the region ’s department of health . 
Funeral homes have reported a total of 7,097 coronavirus deaths in Catalonia up to Wednesday , which includes the regional capital Barcelona . 
But available data from the Spanish Health Ministry had total coronavirus deaths in Catalonia at 3,756 up to Wednesday morning . 
Of these 7,097 deaths , 1,810 people died in elderly people ’s homes . 
CNN has previously reported that a large number of deaths in these facilities were being unreported in national figures . 
The regional health department explained in a statement that these increases were a result of new counting methods that now include deaths in people ’s residences and at nursing homes . 
Previously the figures only included deaths in hospital . 
The number of coronavirus infections could also be 55,000 higher than previously reported in the region . 
While the Spanish government figures show 36,505 total confirmed cases in Catalonia , the region ’s department of health says there are 39,375 positive cases confirmed by diagnostic testing and a further 55,457 cases of people with symptoms , but only diagnosed by a medical professional . 
Barcelona , Spain ’s second largest city , is one of the regions worst affected by Covid 19 . 
The Spanish government has previously explained that their figures are compiled from data submitted by regional health departments .
