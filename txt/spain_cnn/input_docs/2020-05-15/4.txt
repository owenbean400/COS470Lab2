As part of the de escalation process in Spain , 70 % of the population will now have fewer restrictions under phase one . 
The other 30 % of the population — mainly in and around Spain ’s two largest cities of Madrid and Barcelona — remain on phase zero , but with some relief measures , Health Minister Salvador Illa said during a televised news conference on Friday . 
Before the latest changes , just over half of Spain 's population already was on phase one starting May 11 . 
Illa and the director for Health Emergencies Dr . Fernando Simón explained that Madrid ’s region , which includes the Spanish capital and surrounding cities , will remain at phase zero as a precaution despite improvements in reducing coronavirus cases , and quickly detecting new ones .
