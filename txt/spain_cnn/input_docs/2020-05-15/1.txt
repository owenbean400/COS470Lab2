Spain 's Mallorca island in the Mediterranean plans to welcome a limited number of Germans and other travelers in late June in a " pilot project " to restart tourism that has been halted due to coronavirus , Francina Armengol , the Regional President of the Balearic Islands said Thursday . 
The plan would have the large German tour operator TUI fly in Germans or others from European countries or regions that , like Mallorca , have low infection rates , Armengol told CNN and other journalists on a video call . 
In Germany , TUI confirmed that it sees renewed tourism in Mallorca and beyond . 
" We are in constructive talks with a number of local governments where we believe there may be summer holidays , " Martin Riecken , TUI 's Head of Communications , told CNN by phone . 
" We do not believe that Spain as a whole , but the Balearics , also the Canary Islands , with low infection rates , where local governments have made good progress . " 
TUI , he added , is also in talks with tourist destinations in Greece , Cyprus , Croatia and Bulgaria . 
The restart of tourism will depend on national governments re opening borders and lifting 14 day mandatory quarantines for travelers , where they are in effect , Riecken said . 
Spain has announced mandatory 14 day quarantines for all international travelers to the country , starting May 15 , and the rule will last through Spain 's state of emergency .
