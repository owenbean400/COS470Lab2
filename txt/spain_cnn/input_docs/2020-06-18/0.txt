Some 1.2 million people will benefit from the plan , which is part of Spain ’s social and economic Covid 19 reconstruction scheme as it transitions out of the crisis , according to the government ’s press release . 
Some 200,000 euros will go toward health safety schemes and measures to prevent the spread of Covid 19 , including practical steps such as disinfection and cleaning , to " ensure safe and sustainable tourism , " as outlined in the government ’s plan . 
The provisions in the plan include loan guarantees for businesses in the tourism industry , to benefit both companies and workers , some 25 million euros worth of incentives for airlines , Spain ’s airports authority AENA will reduce landing fees , 859 million euros will go to sustainability and renewable energies , as well as modernizing and digitalizing the industry . 
The government says the plan announced today will bring the aid committed to the tourism sector since the start of the pandemic to a total of 19.53 billion euros . 
Spain will reopen its borders from most European Union countries on June 21 , when the country ’s state of emergency , in place since mid March , will be lifted .
