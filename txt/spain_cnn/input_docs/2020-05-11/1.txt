Spain reported 123 coronavirus deaths in the latest 24 hour period on Monday — the lowest number since March 19 , Spanish Ministry of Health data showed . 
At 0.7 %, that 's the lowest daily mortality increase in 7 weeks , bringing the total number of deaths to 26,744 since the start of the pandemic , according to the Ministry ’s figures . 
The rise in new infections since Sunday is 373 , bringing the number of cumulative cases confirmed by PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) tests to 227,436 . 
Just more than half of Spain ’s population got more freedom from the coronavirus lockdown , starting today , as their territories moved to Phase 1 of de escalation , that allows meetings of up to 10 people who do not live together , or the opening only of 50 % of the normal outdoor seating at restaurants . 
The government said it is monitoring to avoid a second wave of infections . 
Spain ’s Director of Health Emergencies , Dr . Fernando Simón , said authorities are closely watching new data from some Spanish hospitals reporting somewhat younger COVID 19 patients . 
" In some hospitals , not many but some hospitals , it seemed they have detected that the average age of people is a bit less , not kids but the average age of people is a bit less , " Simón said at the daily technical briefing press conference . 
" This in principle could be due to various things . 
The first thing we needed to rule out was whether it had something to do , or not , with the release of kids , and apparently it was not . " 
Children under age 14 were allowed out for walks and to exercise , with an adult who lives with them , starting April 26 , after six weeks of strict confinement at home under Spain ’s state of emergency , which remains in effect , aiming to reduce coronavirus infections . 
Simón did not offer further details about this new data on somewhat younger patients .
