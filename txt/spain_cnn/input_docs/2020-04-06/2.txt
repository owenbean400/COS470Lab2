Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said governments are " fighting " over medical supplies to tackle the coronavirus pandemic . 
The foreign minister said that Spain was prioritizing contracts with " exclusive " supplies but also incentivizing local companies to produce some of the equipment instead of buying it from abroad . 
" National production is a very important aspect and will allow us not only to tackle the coronavirus on national territory but also to help other countries that do not have that many resources , " she said .
