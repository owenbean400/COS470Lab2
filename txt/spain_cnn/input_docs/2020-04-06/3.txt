Spanish bought ventilators and other medical equipment held in Ankara by Turkish authorities will take off for Spain on Monday , Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonz√°lez Laya said in an interview with Spanish network Antena 3 . 
The equipment is expected to be available for distribution among regional governments in Spain on Tuesday . 
The ventilators , produced by a company in Turkey , have been held by local authorities in Ankara since Friday . 
On Friday , the foreign minister said the ventilators would not arrive on time because " the Turkish government understands that they are a priority for the treatment of its patients . " 
However , Ankara said that the exporting company lacked the proper authorization because Turkey introduced strict controls on the export of medical equipment a month ago , as the novel coronavirus in the country started to worsen . 
The situation was resolved late on Saturday , with the Spanish foreign minister tweeting thanks to her Turkish counterpart for authorizing the export . 
" We will always stand by our friend Spain , " Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted back . 
" We will overcome these difficult times together . "
