The number of daily deaths in Spain due to Covid 19 rose slightly by 83 on Monday , but were still less than 100 for the third consecutive day , figures reported by the Spanish Health Ministry on Tuesday show . 
The most recent three daily death tolls are the lowest reported in more than two months in the country , where the total number of deaths stands at more than 27,700 . 
Meanwhile , in a sudden pivot , the Spanish government said on Tuesday it will seek a two week extension for its state of emergency order during the coronavirus crisis , but not the one month extension that the Prime Minister had announced just last weekend . 
Some background : The last minute change comes as the Socialist minority government scrambles to garner enough votes in Parliament on Wednesday to approve any extension of the confinement order , which has been subjected to increasing attacks from opposition leaders . 
For weeks , people opposed to the government have been loudly banging pots from their windows and balconies in the evenings . 
But starting in an upscale conservative Madrid neighborhood last week , the protests took to the streets , with the support of right wing groups and parties . 
People draped in Spanish flags , and others , have demanded that their basic right to free movement which is restricted by the state of emergency , be restored . 
But Finance Minister Maria Jesus Montero , also the chief government spokesperson , told a press conference today that the protesters " are asking for freedom of movement . 
That â€™s the freedom to get infected " with coronavirus , she said .
