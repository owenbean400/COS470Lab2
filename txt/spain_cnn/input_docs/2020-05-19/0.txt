On April 28 , Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stood alone on the stage of a bright but empty briefing room . 
As a CNN reporter asked a question via video link , the prime minister looked deep in concentration , scribbling notes and pausing to look at the monitor only once . 
As he launched into his answer , he looked directly into the camera to boast about Spain ’s Covid 19 testing volume . 
" We are one of the countries with the highest number of tests carried out , " Sánchez said . 
Initially , the prime minister cited data from a recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) ranking that had placed Spain eighth in Covid 19 testing among its members . 
There were just two problems : The OECD data had been wrong . 
And while some sources had ranked Spain fifth in total testing volume , Johns Hopkins was not one of them ; the study Sánchez cited does not exist . 
Yet two weeks later , the Spanish government is standing by the substance of its prime minister ’s claim . 
Instead of citing Johns Hopkins , Spanish officials are now pointing to testing rankings from a data aggregation website called Worldometer -- one of the sources behind the university ’s widely cited coronavirus dashboard — and prompting questions about why some governments and respected institutions have chosen to trust a source about which little is known .
