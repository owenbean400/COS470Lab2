Spain will lift quarantine measures for arriving international tourists starting July 1 , the Spanish government announced Monday . 
What this is about : Spain currently enforces a two week quarantine for all international travelers to the country , a measure in effect since May 15 . 
The quarantine measure applies to Spanish , as well as foreign arrivals . 
Some more context : Spain ’s tourism and hospitality sector have been hit hard by the Covid 19 pandemic , and the government has come under pressure to revive this part of the economy , which accounts for 12 % of GDP and 2.6 million jobs . 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signaled the country will reactivate foreign tourism in July , during a press conference Saturday . 
The country , under strict confinement measures since March 14 to limit the spread of the coronavirus , is now on a gradual reopening . 
Just over half of the population is on Phase 1 , including Madrid and Barcelona , and the rest is on the more advanced Phase 2 , which allows even more businesses to re open and more social activities , including weddings with up to 100 guests .
