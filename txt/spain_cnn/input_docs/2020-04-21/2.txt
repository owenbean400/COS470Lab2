" CONTAGIOUS RAT " read the message in large black letters painted on the side of Dr . Silvana Bonino ’s car . 
The Barcelona gynecologist was shocked to find the hateful graffiti in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic , and she quickly filed a complaint with the Catalan regional police . 
It did not take long for the police to identify a suspect , a man whom they put under investigation for an alleged hate crime , said a Catalan police spokesperson . 
" We monitor social networks to prevent violence , " against health care workers , the police spokesperson said . 
" We can only take the complaints and act on them . 
Beyond this , there ’s not much we can do . " 
A spokesperson for Dr . Bonino ’s private practice at the IDONA clinic said , " At this point , Dr . Bonino would just like to move on with her life . " 
Elsewhere in Spain , the climate of suspicion came even closer to home for Dr . Jesus Monllor Mendez , who found a note on his apartment front door , encouraging him to move out . 
This was in the small city of Ciudad Real , in the region of La Mancha , where the famed Don Quijote novel was set . Dr . Mendez said , " It made me sad , but I understood it as Covid 19 has done a lot of harm to our country . 
The lady who did this acted impulsively – I hold no resentment . " 
But Dr . Mendez , considers these incidents " exceptional and rare . 
Outside of this , the response from my community has been extremely grateful , " he said . 
" The mayor even brought me a thank you note . 
Another neighbor left a poster on my door saying , ‘ here lives a hero ’ . " 
Remember : There has been overwhelming support for the health workers on Twitter and in the media in response to the hateful messages . 
Across Spain , at 8 p.m . local time daily , millions of Spaniards applaud from their balconies and windows to thank the nation ’s health care workers for their front line battle against coronavirus .
