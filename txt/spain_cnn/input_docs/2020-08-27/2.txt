Spain has announced that face coverings will be mandatory in schools for children over the age of six , as part of measures that schools must adopt when they return in September . 
Health Minister Salvador Illa and Education Minister Isabel Cela√° said Thursday that " in person " education is their priority and showed a document containing 29 measures and five recommendations agreed with the Spain 's regional governments . 
Among those measures , Illa highlighted : The compulsory use of masks for all children from 6 years of age A " bubble system " minimizing one classes ' contact with the others A safety distance of 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) Frequent ventilation and disinfection of the classrooms The use of disinfectant gel " at least 5 times a day " Temperature checks done every morning either at home or at school Illa explained that this were the " minimum mandatory measures " for all centers , but that regional governments could adapt or add other measures in their territory . 
A decrease in the number of pupils per class was not included in the document although some regions have already announced they will reduce them to 20 . 
The closure of a school would be " a last resort and only temporary , when there is uncontrolled and generalized transmission , " said Illa . 
Otherwise , a positive case in a school will only quarantine that pupil 's bubble .
