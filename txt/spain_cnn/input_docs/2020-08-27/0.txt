Spain 's Finance Minister Nadia Calviño said on Thursday that " the Spanish economy has started to recover " from the effects of Covid 19 , although " some industries and geographic areas may have more difficulty . " 
Calviño told Spanish TV channel Antena 3 that that " 75 % of the workers who were under the ERTE furlough scheme have already returned to work , " adding that the government will have to look at " whether that ERTE furlough needs to be extended beyond September for some sectors that might be more affected . " 
" We need to avoid structural damage to our economy , " she warned . 
The minister added that " this year we will have to issue € 100 billion ( $ 118bn ) more debt that we had envisaged . "
