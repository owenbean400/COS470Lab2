The UK is likely around seven to 10 days from seeing its coronavirus outbreak start to flatten , a leading epidemiologist has predicted . 
Neil Ferguson , whose model influenced the UK government 's coronavirus response , told the BBC on Sunday : " We think this epidemic in the UK will plateau in the next week to 10 days . " 
He said the manner the curve of cases takes is vital , adding it is not clear whether the UK will " see a long flat peak , or , as we hope , see a much faster decline . " 
" We have some signs that it is slowing the epidemic at the moment , " Ferguson added , noting the UK has seen its first day where new hospital admittances declined over the previous day . 
The UK has seen more than 4,000 deaths from Covid 19 and is roughly following the trajectory of countries including Spain and Italy , which have each suffered more than 10,000 fatalities .
