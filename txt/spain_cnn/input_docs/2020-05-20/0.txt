People in Spain are now required to wear face masks in public spaces when a minimum two meter ( about 6.5 feet ) distance ca not be guaranteed , the Health Ministry announced in a decree today . 
The rule applies to all people over the age of six , in both indoor and outdoor spaces . 
People who have respiratory problems or disabilities incompatible with masks are exempt . 
" Any type of mask " is allowed as long as it covers the nose and mouth , though the ministry recommended " hygienic and surgical " masks . 
Emergency order : Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and other government ministers will meet today to vote on extending the national state of emergency by two weeks . 
The state of emergency , with strict movement restrictions , started March 14 and has so far been extended four times , for a total of 10 weeks . 
It has apparently helped curb the virus -- Spain has seen its daily new cases and deaths begin to slow -- but it has also attracted criticism from some quarters . 
For weeks , some people banged pots from their windows in the evenings as a form of protest -- this escalated to marching on the streets last week to demand the government end restrictions on movement .
