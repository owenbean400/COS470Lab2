In a tight vote , the Spanish Parliament on Wednesday narrowly approved the fifth extension of the country ’s state of emergency for another two weeks . 
The state of emergency will last until June 7 . 
Now in its tenth week , the extended state of emergency , which has been in place since March 14 , will allow the Spanish government to continue regulating restrictions on movement with the aim of controlling the coronavirus for a total of 12 weeks . 
Some context : The lengthy state of emergency has widened political rifts in Spain , with the right and far right accusing the government of ineptitude in handling the Covid 19 pandemic , blaming it for tens of thousands of deaths , and holding it responsible for the country ’s economic nosedive . 
Speaking ahead of the vote in Spain ’s lower chamber , Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that in the fight against Covid 19 , " the state of emergency and de escalation have worked , the state of emergency will not last one day longer than it needs to . " 
Sánchez was firm in his position that " there is no alternative to the state of emergency " and lifting it now " would be an extraordinary irresponsibility . " 
Spain imposed some of Europe ’s strictest confinement and de escalation measures , gradually lifting restrictions asymmetrically across the country starting in early May , depending on infection rates and the capacity of health institutions in its territories . 
The prime minister said the country is " in the last few meters [ yards ] of the state of emergency . " 
Spain is among countries with the world ’s highest coronavirus infection and death numbers ; but has managed to significantly bring those down in recent weeks .
