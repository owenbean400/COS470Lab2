Marie Delus had not touched her mother since she took her to a New York City emergency room in March . 
But after more than five months in hospital and a nursing home , Delus ' mother , Marie Jean Pierre , was released on Saturday , her family told CNN . 
Jean Pierre , 73 , was admitted to Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn on March 21 with a low grade fever and difficulty breathing . 
After testing positive for coronavirus , she was intubated and later placed on a ventilator , according to her daughter . 
At some point , she received a tracheotomy . 
" She was fighting every step of the way . 
She was fighting the doctors , she was fighting the nurses , " Marie Delus said . 
" She did not want to be on the ventilator . " 
Jean Pierre , Delus and other family members had traveled to Spain in early March on a once in a lifetime trip , returning on March 11 . 
Multiple people who went on the trip became ill , with five becoming " very sick , " Delus said . 
Jean Pierre was " out of it , " remembering little of almost three months in the hospital , she told CNN . 
She was transferred to Brooklyn 's Saints Joachim and Anne Nursing and Rehab Center , where she had to relearn how to walk and talk , and was unable to see her family , except from behind glass , Jean Pierre said .
