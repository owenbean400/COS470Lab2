Johnson & Johnson ’s vaccine arm Janssen Pharmaceuticals is starting a new , advanced Phase 3 trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine in Britain , which uses two doses instead of just one to see if that protects people better against infection . 
Most of the coronavirus vaccines in late stage clinical trials around the world require two doses for full protection , including leading candidates being developed by Pfizer , Moderna , Astra Zeneca and Novavax . 
Janssen ’s was the lone single dose vaccine in Phase 3 trials in the US and Britain . 
Where will the trial be rolled out : Up to 30,000 people will be enrolled in the new global trial , with participants in Belgium , Colombia , France , Germany , the Philippines , South Africa , Spain , the United Kingdom and the United States , the company said in a statement . 
" In order to evaluate the efficacy of Janssen ’s Covid 19 vaccine candidate , clinical trial sites in countries and areas with high incidence of Covid 19 and the ability to achieve a rapid initiation were selected . " 
Two doses : Volunteers will get two shots , 57 days apart , or placebos . 
The first volunteer was scheduled to be vaccinated in Britain Monday . 
Janssen ’s Phase 3 trial paused for two weeks in the US over safety concerns but resumed in October .
