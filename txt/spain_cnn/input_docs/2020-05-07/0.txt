The Spanish capital will reopen some of the city 's parks from tomorrow , Madrid 's City Hall said today . 
Starting Friday , most neighborhood parks and garden areas in the city will be open , but playgrounds and exercise areas will remain closed . 
The city will also prohibit vehicles on some of its major streets this weekend to guarantee those going out for walks , runs or bicycle rides can maintain social distancing and follow safety rules . 
But the city 's most emblematic parks , such as El Retiro in the city center and the sprawling Casa de Campo park on the east side , will remain closed " to avoid big crowds . " 
The traffic cuts will start Saturday and continue for several weekends . 
While Spain continues to wind down its state of emergency confinement order , the government is set to announce certain regions may advance to the first phase of reopening . 
But that 's only if they can show their region 's infection rates are low and health facilities are able to quickly handle any new outbreaks . 
Madrid is one of the regions asking the central government to move to Phase 1 as early as next Monday . 
Madrid ’s Regional Government Vice President Ignacio Aguado told Spanish Radio SER his region is ready and has met the health criteria . 
The region includes the capital city and the surrounding other cities and towns . 
Spain 's Director for Health Emergencies , Dr . Fernando Simón , reiterated any decision will be based on health criteria and would depend on the evolution of the pandemic . 
" The health criteria to change phases are health [ criteria ] , they are not economic . 
The economic criteria will have to be given by whoever is responsible for that and it will have to assess if they are worth more than the health ones , but that is not discussed in the ( technical ) groups that I am taking part in , " he said .
