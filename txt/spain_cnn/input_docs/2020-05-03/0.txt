Spain reported 164 deaths from Covid 19 in the last 24 hours , the lowest number in six weeks , according to new figures released by the country ’s Ministry of Health on Sunday . 
The total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic in the country stands at 25,264 . 
Speaking at the government ’s daily coronavirus technical briefing , Simón noted a " clear decrease of numbers " of new hospital and intensive care unit admissions , as well as a 0.39 % rise in new infections since Saturday , which are about half of the numbers of those who have recovered in the same period . 
Simón cautioned that Sunday ’s markedly improved numbers could be influenced by the delayed long weekend holiday reporting from Spain ’s 17 regions . 
More data : A total of 42,111 health workers have been infected by coronavirus to date , Spain ’s health ministry Sunday reported , representing nearly one fifth of all cases at 19 % . 
As Spain gradually begins its de escalation from strict confinement in place orders in place since March 15 , four islands in the Canaries and the Balearics will be the first to transition to so called " Phase One " on Monday . 
During this time , a further opening up of small businesses and further lifting of restrictions on movements is expected because the islands " have not had any new cases in many days , and very few , or no new infections . "
