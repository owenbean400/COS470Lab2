More than 50 % of Spain ’s population will advance to phase one on Monday as part of the country ’s de escalation process , during the coronavirus crisis , Spain 's health minister announced on Friday . 
But Madrid and Barcelona , the two largest cities in the country and the hardest hit by the pandemic are staying behind . 
At a nationally televised news conference on Friday evening , Health Minister Salvador Illa and the Director for Health Emergencies , Dr . Fernando Simón , said the government decided which parts of the country could advance to phase one , after consulting with Spain 's 17 regional governments regarding infection rates in each region , the capacity to quickly detect any new cases and how each region 's hospitals could respond to any second wave . 
Simón listed a total of 11 regions that will transition fully to the next phase : Galicia , Asturias , Cantabria , Pais Vasco , La Rioja , Navarra , Aragon , Extremadura , Murcia , Balearic Islands , Canaries , and Spain ’s two enclaves on Morocco ’s north coast , Ceuta and Melilla . 
Other regions such as Castilla Leon , Catalonia , Castilla La Mancha , Valencia and Andalusia will have some of their provinces or health districts advancing to phase one , but not the entire region . 
The Madrid region , which includes the Spanish capital and surrounding cities , had requested to move to phase one but the health minister said the region has not met all the technical criteria yet and would not predict when it could advance to the next level . 
Barcelona , Spain 's second largest city that is also a province of the same name , with numerous adjacent cities , also did not advance to phase one . 
The Madrid region and Barcelona province have special challenges , with density of population , movement of that population , their exchange nationally with other parts of Spain and their international interaction , Simón added .
