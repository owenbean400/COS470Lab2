Marc Marquez , who has six Moto GP titles among the eight world championships to his name , has been quarantined at his parents ' house in Cervera , Spain , for the last two months . 
Alongside him is his brother Alex , reigning Moto2 champion and now Repsol Honda Moto GP teammate . 
The two brothers were poised to begin a new and intimate chapter of their sibling rivalry at the opening Moto GP in Qatar in March when the premier class race was abruptly canceled , leaving the pair in a unique state of limbo .

" I promise , " Marc told CNN Sport via video conference from his family home , " even when we were kids , we were playing for everything : who goes to bed earlier , who got out of home earlier ;
