New York mayor Bill de Blasio has criticised residents who were seen gathering without masks outside bars at the weekend despite the city ’s ongoing " stay at home " guidelines , saying they were putting lives in danger . 
Almost 90,000 people have died in the US from Covid 19 so far during the pandemic , far more than any other country , according to Johns Hopkins . 
More than 15,000 of those deaths were in New York City , which is still subject to stay at home measures even as many other US cities begin to open up again . 
" We ’re not going to tolerate people starting to congregate . 
It ’s as simple as that , " De Blasio said on Sunday . 
" If we have to shut places down , we will . "
