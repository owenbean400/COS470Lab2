New York City will impose fines on people who refuse to wear a face covering as the rate of positive tests for coronavirus climbed above 3 % for the first time in months , mayor Bill de Blasio has said . 
Officials will first offer free masks to those caught not wearing one . 
If the person refuses , they will face an unspecified fine , de Blasio told reporters , according to Reuters . 
" Our goal , of course , is to give everyone a free face mask , " de Blasio said . 
" We do not want to fine people , but if we have to we will . " 
The new rule extends across the city a similar policy imposed earlier this month by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , controlled by New York state governor , Andrew Cuomo , in which commuters who refuse to wear a mask on public transit face a $ 50 fine . 
De Blasio â€™s office did not respond to questions about who would enforce the new fines and how much they would be . 
The city wide daily positive test rate was 3.25 % . 
The mayor attributed the rise in part to nine zip codes out of 146 that city health officials say have seen a worrying uptick in cases , including several tight knit Hasidic Jewish communities . 
The seven day rolling average for positive coronavirus tests was 1.38 % .
