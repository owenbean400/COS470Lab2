A poll of Black immigrant domestic workers in New York , Miami Dade and Massachusetts found that 70 % had lost their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
The survey conducted by The Institute for Policy Studies and the National Domestic Workers Alliance includes responses from 800 workers . 
Half of those surveyed said they were afraid of seeking assistance from the federal or local government due to their immigration status . 
Just as the pandemic hit the US , the Trump administration â€™s public charge rule , which allows the government to deny green cards and visas to immigrants who rely on public benefits , took effect .
