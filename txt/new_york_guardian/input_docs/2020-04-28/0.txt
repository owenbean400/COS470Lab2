Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain , Italy and Spain , Reuters reports . 
All three children - who range in age from 6 months to 8 years - have undergone treatment at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York , and all had fever and inflammation of the heart and the gut."Right now , we ’re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents , " Columbia ’s Dr Mark Gorelik told Reuters . 
Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease , a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries . 
The syndrome has been largely undetected in the United States , according to the American Academy of Pediatrics . 
Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease , but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki , which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response .
