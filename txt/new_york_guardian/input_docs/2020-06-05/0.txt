In New York , the Associated Press reports that arrests from a week of protests have started to put a strain on the city ’s justice system amid the Covid 19 pandemic . 
There have been well over 2,000 arrests as police seek to impose order across the city . 
Public defenders say too many of those arrested have been detained for too long in cramped and unsanitary conditions while authorities figure who should receive summonses for minor violations and go free , or be charged in criminal complaints and face arraignments remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic . 
The backlog prompted The Legal Aid Society to file a lawsuit demanding the New York police department release people held in violation of a requirement to get them in front of a judge within 24 hours , a situation that one defense lawyer said " appears to be designed to retaliate against New Yorkers protesting police brutality . " 
Patricia Miller , who heads the city ’s Special Federal Litigation Division , called the allegation " disingenuous " and " exceptionally unfair " . 
The NYPD and court system are " working within the confines of a pandemic and now suddenly called upon not only to secure orderly protesting , but also to address rioters who are committing burglaries , destroying private property , and assaulting fellow New Yorkers , " Miller said .
