Reuters reports that morgues and hospitals in New York City , the centre of the US outbreak , bent under the strain on Thursday , struggling to treat or bury casualties , as New York state â€™s Governor Andrew Cuomo offered a grim prediction the rest of the country would soon face the same misery . 
Staff at one medical centre in Brooklyn were seen disposing of their gowns and caps and other protective wear in a sidewalk trash can after wheeling bodies out of the hospital and loading them into a refrigerated truck . 
Cuomo had earlier said the New York would run out of ventilators in six days .
