New York ’s Metropolitan Museum of Art is cutting a further 353 staff as the coronavirus pandemic takes its toll on museums around the world due to restrictions on movement and concerns about public gatherings . 
The reduction will come through a combination of the elimination of positions , voluntary retirements and furloughs , a spokeswoman for the museum said . 
The museum is projecting a $ 150m loss in revenue due to the pandemic , the spokeswoman said . 
Its annual budget is $ 320m . 
The Met laid off over 80 people in April after closing in March as the pandemic spread across New York . 
The latest cuts will take its employee count to about 1,600 , down from about 2,000 in March . 
The New York Times cited a memo sent to the museum ’s staff on Wednesday , specifying 79 staff members had been laid off , 181 were furloughed and 93 took voluntary retirement . 
Chief executive Dan Weiss said : We recognize that the Museum that we will return to - whenever that may be - will be very different from what we left behind only six months ago . We have worked to ensure that these painful staff reductions are distributed across the entire Museum so that no one area or group is taking on an outsized burden .
