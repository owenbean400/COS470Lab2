Every night in New York , residents clap for essential workers at 7pm . 
Journalist Sophie Friedman shared this wonderful video of her neighbour in East Village , who stands on the roof every evening to play the bagpipes as part of the daily display of gratitude . 
This video is a lovely moment of light in these difficult times - I hope it makes you smile , as it did for me . 
" The highlight of the day for me and my neighbors in the East Village is the 7pm clap for essential workers . 
Several dozen of us go up onto our rooftops and just go wild : shaking tambourines , clapping , whooping , and banging on pots and pants , waving to each other , thanking essential workers for putting themselves on the line , " said Friedman . 
" My neighbor directly across the street comes up to his roof right at 6:59 and then starts playing his bagpipes . 
This encouraged someone on my side of the street to start playing drums in tune with the bagpiper . 
This is the only time of the day most of us go outside and see other people , and the rooftop clapping has engendered a real sense of camaraderie . " 
New York is the worst hit state in the US , which now has both the highest death toll and the highest number of cases of coronavirus in the world .
