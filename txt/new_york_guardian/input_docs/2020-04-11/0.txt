New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has issued an executive order requiring face coverings for all customers entering restaurants and bars to pick up carry out food in the state . 
Murphy ’s order , which goes into effect on Monday at 8pm , comes as New Jersey ’s numbers continue to surge with at least 58,151 cases and 2,183 deaths due to Covid 19 – including 3,599 new positive tests and 251 new fatalities in the last 24 hours – second only to New York nationally . 
" Some may view this as another inconvenience , " Murphy said during his daily press briefing on Saturday in Trenton . 
" But you know what would be really inconvenient , is if you ended up in hospital with Covid 19 or if you infected a family member . 
We accept this is inconvenient . " 
The order also includes a directive for NJ Transit and private carriers to cut all rail and bus capacity by 50 % in an effort to curb the spread and for all transit workers to be provided face masks and gloves .
