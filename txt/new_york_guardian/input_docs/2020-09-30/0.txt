New York City restaurants have welcomed patrons back inside for the first time in months as authorities scrambled to contain Covid 19 outbreaks in some neighbourhoods . 
Coronavirus infection rates continued to climb in many of the nine ZIP codes in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn where new clusters have emerged , mayor Bill de Blasio said . 
The city is deploying 400 police officers as well as other officials to improve compliance with social distancing rules and a face covering mandate in the affected neighbourhoods . 
Residents and visitors will be fined up to $ 1,000 if they refuse to wear a mask in public , de Blasio said on Tuesday , after the daily positivity rate topped 3 % for the first time since June as more students headed back to the classroom . 
On Wednesday , the rate ticked back under 1 % , he told a news conference , while the seven day rolling average of infections rose slightly to 1.46 % . 
Indoor dining made a comeback but at 25 % capacity and with many restrictions : tables have to be six feet apart , staff must take patrons ’ temperature before they enter the restaurant and bar tops will remain closed for seating . 
New York governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday slammed local authorities for failing to strictly enforce coronavirus health and safety rules in the state ’s 20 hot spot ZIP codes , and threatened to take action if they did not step up . 
" Local governments , enforce the law . 
If you are unwilling to enforce the law , I will enforce the law , " Cuomo said . 
The governor said he had " a good conversation " on Wednesday morning with the leaders of the state ’s Jewish Orthodox community , which has experienced a rise in infections , and planned to have a second one in the afternoon . 
The areas of concern in the state are in Rockland , Orange and Nassau , in addition to the New York City neighbourhoods .
