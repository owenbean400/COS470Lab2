The president of the United Nations General Assembly has expressed concern that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected a meeting with him to discuss the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on the work of the 193 member world organization , AP reports . 
Volker Bozkir said in a statement that the United Nations " has been proud to call the city its home since the middle of the last century " and is " happy to generate billions of dollars in economic benefits and tens of thousands of jobs in New York City . " 
But the Turkish politician said he was disappointed at the mayor ’s refusal to meet him . 
Bozkir said : " This lack of interaction concerns me . " 
His spokesman , Brenden Varma , told reporters that Bozkir reached out about two weeks ago to ask for an appointment with the mayor . 
But the assembly president received a response a few days ago declining the request , he said . 
Penny Abeywardena , New York City ’s commissioner for international affairs , responded to the assembly president ’s statement without mentioning the mayor ’s decision not to meet Bozkir . 
She pointed to de Blasio ’s " excellent relationship " with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and " deeply collaborative relationship with Mr Bozkir ’s predecessors , " and said the city looks forward " to continuing our partnership with the United Nations . "
