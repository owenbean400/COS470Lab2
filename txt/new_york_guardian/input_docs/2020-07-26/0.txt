President Donald Trump has announced his itinerary for next month amid the pandemic . 
Because of my strong focus on the China Virus , including scheduled meetings on Vaccines , our economy and much else , I wo not be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @ Yankees on August 15th . 
We will make it later in the season !
