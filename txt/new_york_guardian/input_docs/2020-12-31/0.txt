New York City ’s Times Square was barricaded on Thursday , with only a handful of invited guests , including health care workers and others from the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic , allowed in to watch the New Year ’s Eve ball drop in person . 
Mayor Bill de Blasio said everyone else should stay home and watch the pared down festivities on television ; scores of events around the US have been similarly curtailed or moved online . 
Tens of thousands of people usually fill the blocks around Times Square , standing for hours in the cold at the focal point of US New Year ’s Eve celebrations , waiting for a crystal ball to slowly descend in the year ’s final seconds . 
Police will allow in only a few dozen this year , with masks and no sign of fever required for entry . 
Among them will be the Bronx born singer Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Gaynor , who is due to sing her disco classic I Will Survive for a few dozen frontline workers and their families . 
Organisers have invited a grocery store worker , a building doorman , a pizza delivery man and doctors and nurses , including Sandra Lindsay , the New York nurse this month who became the first recipient of a coronavirus vaccine in the US outside trials . 
More than 25,000 New Yorkers were killed by Covid 19 this year : back in spring , the city grappled with what was the world ’s deadliest outbreak at the time . 
" It ’s going to be actually , arguably , the most special , the most poignant , the most moving New Year ’s Eve , " de Blasio , who will push the button to start the crystal ball ’s descent , told reporters . 
" In 2021 , we ’re going to show people what it looks like to recover , to come back . " 
As new daily case tallies continue to rise across the US , bars and restaurants and other gathering places are closed or have sharply limited capacity . 
In Las Vegas , Boston and beyond , official fireworks displays have been cancelled .
