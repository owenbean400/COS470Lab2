New York state governor Andrew Cuomo harshly criticised US president Donald Trump ’s handling of the pandemic on Sunday , and accused his administration of being " still in denial mode " . 
Writing on Twitter , Cuomo decried the absence of a national strategy for testing and mask rules , which has put the onus of coming up with solutions on governments of individual states . 
The White House has learned nothing from COVID . 
National threats require national leadership . 
It 's been 6 months without a national strategy on testing or mask mandate . 
Only the federal government has the power to go to war with COVID.They are failing and the nation suffers . 
They are still in denial mode . 
Do not test and if we ca not find the cases — they do not exist . 
Great , then let 's cure cancer by stopping screenings . 
Absurd ! 
After New York was initially the worst hit area in the country , new infections and deaths have dropped sharply after mass scale testing was introduced . 
Of the 100,022 tests reported yesterday , 698 were positive ( 0.69 % of total ) , making Saturday the 23rd consecutive day with an infection rate of below 1 % . 
Total hospitalisations fell to 429 and 8 further people in the state died with Covid 19 .
