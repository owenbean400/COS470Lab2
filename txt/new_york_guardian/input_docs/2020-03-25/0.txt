Hi , this is Helen Sullivan with you now , taking over from my colleague Kevin Rawlinson . 
In the US , Alexandra Villarrea reports for the Guardian that during a press conference Wednesday afternoon , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell for allegedly standing in the way of real aid to New York . 
De Blasio said : It should have been one of the easiest no brainers in the world for the U.S . Senate to include real money for New York City and New York state in this stimulus bill , and yet it did not happen . 
And we know why — because Mitch Mc Connell would not let it happen . 
I do not understand how anybody — any public servant — could live with themselves if they deprived the cities in the middle of the biggest crisis since the great depression — deprived us , deprived our state — of the money we need . " 
De Blasio took issue with the fact that New York City only got $ 1 billion out of the $ 150 billion pool of funds provided for the entire country in the Senate ’s stimulus bill when New York City alone accounts for almost two thirds of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S . To deal with crowd density , de Blasio said he would be removing hoops at 80 of New York City ’s 1,700 basketball courts because people were not properly social distancing . 
He also said that he ’s working to release any inmates who can be directly acted on , who do not pose a threat to the community . 
By tonight , he said he will have released 200 inmates .
