British Airways is to launch a voluntary coronavirus test for passengers travelling to the UK from three American airports . 
The airline said it will trial a testing regime , in partnership with American Airlines , which will involve hundreds of travellers on particular routes from the US to Heathrow . 
The passengers will be tested 72 hours before departure , and then on arrival at the west London airport , and three days later . 
British Airways , which will share the results of the project with the UK and US governments , is hoping to persuade ministers that testing travellers will make quarantining unnecessary . 
We believe that testing passengers for COVID 19 , instead of imposing quarantine , is the safest and most efficient way to get the world flying again . 
We will be inviting customers travelling from New York and Los Angeles to the UK to take part in our trial . 
# testingmustfly Passengers who take part in the pilot will still be required to follow existing quarantine rules , even if they receive negative results for all three tests . 
The pilot begins on November 25 for flights from New York , Los Angeles and Dallas .
