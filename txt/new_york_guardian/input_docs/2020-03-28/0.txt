New York governor Andrew Cuomo has described Trump â€™s idea of a lockdown in the state as " anti American " . 
Earlier , Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing a quarantine in New York , and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut . 
However , Cuomo has said that the travel ban would be " counter productive " , telling CNN : " If you started walling off areas all across the country it would be totally bizarre , counter productive , anti American " . 
" It makes absolutely no sense and I do not think any serious governmental personality or professional would support it , " he added . 
The United States now has more than 120,000 confirmed cases , the highest figure in the world , with New York the national epicentre of the virus .
