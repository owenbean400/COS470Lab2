In Washington , the US president Donald Trump has been pressed on whether he would heed the warnings of health officials , including some who advise him , as to whether the country could reopen by early May . Trump has reportedly been hoping to see that . 
At first he digressed . 
I listen to them about everything . 
I have great respect for these people . 
All of them ... 
In fact I told Tony Fauci , why do not you move to New York , run against AOC , you will win easily . 
I kid you know that . 
Asked again , he did not budge . 
I can only say this : I have tremendous respect for these doctors and we ’ve done very well . 
I have great respect for these people . 
I ’m never saying bad about these people . 
And then pressed a third time Trump said : I will certainly listen . 
I will certainly listen . 
There are two sides . 
Remember , I understand both sides of an argument very well .
