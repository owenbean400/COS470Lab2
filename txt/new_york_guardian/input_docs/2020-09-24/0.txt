The governor of New York , Andrew Cuomo , said the state will carry out its own review of coronavirus vaccines approved by the federal government due to concerns of politicisation of the approval process . 
Cuomo , a Democrat who has repeatedly criticised the US president , Donald Trump , and his administration ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic , told reporters he was going to form a review committee to advise the state on the safety of a vaccine . 
He said : Frankly , I ’m not going to trust the federal government ’s opinion . 
New York state will have its own review when the federal government is finished with their review and says it ’s safe .
