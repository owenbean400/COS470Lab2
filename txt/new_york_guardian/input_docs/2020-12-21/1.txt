Virgin Atlantic will require all travellers from London to the United States to present evidence of a negative Covid 19 test before departure under a new pre departure screening from 24 December , a spokesman said on Monday . 
The move follows an earlier request from the New York governor , Andrew Cuomo , that airlines only allow passengers who test negative for the coronavirus to fly to New York â€™s John F Kennedy International Airport following the emergence of a highly infectious new strain in the UK .
