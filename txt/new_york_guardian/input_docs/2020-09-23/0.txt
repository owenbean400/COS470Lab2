New York ’s famed Metropolitan Opera has cancelled its entire upcoming season and said it would remain closed until September 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic , a sign of the continuing struggles for live entertainment . 
The 3,800 seat opera house normally stages more than 200 performances each season and welcomes nearly 800,000 visitors . 
The organisation said in a statement : We regret to inform you that the Metropolitan Opera has made the extremely difficult decision to cancel the entirety of the 2020-21 season , based on the advice of health officials who advise the Met and Lincoln Center . 
Because of the many hundreds of performers who are required to rehearse and perform in close quarters and because of the company ’s large audience , it was determined that it would not be safe for the Met to resume until a vaccine is widely in use , herd immunity is established , and the wearing of masks and social distancing is no longer a medical requirement . 
The Met said it had ambitious plans for a new season beginning in September 2021 with the premiere of Terence Blanchard ’s Fire Shut up in my Bones , the first opera by a Black composer to be performed at the Met . 
Operators of Broadway theatres , among the biggest tourist attractions in New York , currently aim to reopen in January 2021 .
