The first wave of coronavirus in the United States is not over . 
Nearly half of states are reporting a rise in new cases and some continue to break records in their daily reported cases . 
In the South , officials say more young people are testing positive . 
And across the US , experts continue to repeat warnings highlighting the need for social distancing and face covers . 
And while some point to the rise in numbers as a result of more testing , health officials say that 's part of -- but not the full picture . 
" More testing does in fact turn out more cases . 
However ... if widespread testing was the entire reason for the rise in cases , you 'd expect to see the proportion of positive tests go down or at the very least remain steady . 
We 're not seeing that , " says Dr . Shoshana Ungerleider , a specialist in internal medicine at the California Pacific Medical Center . 
These are the 23 states reporting a rise in new cases : Washington , California , Nevada , Idaho , Montana , Wyoming , Colorado , Utah , Arizona , Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , Missouri , Michigan , Ohio , Kentucky , West Virginia , Tennessee , Georgia , South Carolina , Florida , Delaware and Hawaii . 
These 10 states are staying steady in new cases : Oregon , New Mexico , North Dakota , Nebraska , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Indiana , Arkansas , and Virginia . 
And these 17 states are reporting declines in new cases : South Dakota , Illinois , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Alaska , Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Maryland .
