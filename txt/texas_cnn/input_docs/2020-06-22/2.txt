Officials in states across the South have warned that more young people in their 20s and 30s are now testing positive for the novel coronavirus . 
This recent rise in cases among young adults could lower Covid 19 death rates , Dr . Tom Frieden , former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , wrote on Twitter . 
" With younger age of recent infections in at least some places such as Florida , expect a lower death rate in this wave ... until the 20-40 year olds who are infected today go on to infect others , " Frieden , president and CEO of the initiative Resolve to Save Lives , tweeted on Sunday . 
Some background : The Florida Department of Health reported 3,494 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday , bringing the state total to 97,291 . 
Florida Gov . 
Ron De Santis has said that cases are " shifting in a radical direction " toward populations in their 20s and 30s .
