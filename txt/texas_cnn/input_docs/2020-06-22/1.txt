Across the American South , officials are raising alarm about an increased number of younger people testing positive for the novel coronavirus . 
In Mississippi , officials attributed clusters of new cases to fraternity rush parties . 
In North Carolina , a rise in cases is primarily among the younger population aged 25-49 , said Gov . 
Roy Cooper on Friday . 
In Texas , the governor said last week people under 30 made up a majority of new coronavirus cases in several counties . 
He said that increase in young infected people could be related to Memorial Day parties , visits to bars or other gatherings . 
And in Florida , Gov . 
Ron De Santis said Saturday cases are " shifting in a radical direction " toward populations in their 20s and 30s . 
Those younger groups , he said , are mostly asymptomatic and do not require clinical attention .
