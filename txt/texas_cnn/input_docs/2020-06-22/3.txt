Dr . Scott Gottlieb , former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , says some areas of the country are " seeing significant outbreaks on top of a background rate of spread that was quite high . " 
Speaking on CBS ’ " Face the Nation " Sunday , Gottlieb said , " We are seeing a resurgence in the South and Southeast " because those areas were " never really rid of their epidemics . " 
Gottlieb said the cases are " building quite quickly " in places such as Texas , Florida , Alabama , North Carolina , South Carolina and Arizona . 
They could see " exponential growth " this week , he said . 
" The challenge with exponential growth is that everything looks okay , until suddenly it does not , " he said . 
Gottlieb warned , " This is going to be hard to get under control , " saying , " there is no quick intervention that is going to bring this to an end . " 
" The challenge is there is not a clear end point , " Gottlieb added . 
" We are becoming more and more dependent on a therapeutic intervention in the fall , because we are taking a lot of virus through the summer . 
We really should not be where we are in June right now , " he said . 
When it comes to universal masking , Gottlieb said it ’s a mistake for some states not to , " they are losing precious time . " 
" Masking has becoming controversial . 
It should not be . 
It ’s a simple intervention . 
It ’s a collective action we can all take to help protect our fellow citizens and also protect ourselves and try to reopen the economy safely , " he said .
