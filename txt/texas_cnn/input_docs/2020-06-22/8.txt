The shift of the coronavirus pandemic to younger Americans is not necessarily good news , said Dr . Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute . 
Parts of Florida , South Carolina , Georgia , Texas and other states — many of which were some of the first to reopen following shutdowns — have reported that new coronavirus cases are being diagnosed in increasingly younger populations . 
" We have known that younger people are less likely to get sick and less likely to die from the virus , " Jha told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer . 
But even if they do not get sick themselves , they can infect others , Jha noted . 
" Those younger people have parents . 
They have grandparents , and they are going to go see those people , " Jha added . 
" The more the virus spreads , the more everybody is vulnerable , " Jha said .
