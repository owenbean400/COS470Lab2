Infectious disease expert Dr . Peter Hotez is worried that Houston and Harris County could become the worst affected spot for Covid 19 in North America . 
Hotez , dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , has been sounding steady warnings about the pandemic . 
" Latest # COVID19 for Harris County , my observation if this trajectory persists : 1 ) Houston would become the worst affected city in the US , maybe rival what we ’re seeing now in Brazil 2 ) The masks = good 1st step but simply wo not be enough 3 ) We would need to proceed to red alert , " Hotez tweeted on Saturday . 
Harris County is listed at Orange Level 2 on the county ’s own Covid 19 threat level system , with " significant uncontrolled " spread of the virus . 
Red Level 1 means the virus is classified as " severe uncontrolled . " 
Numbers for Harris County show a sharp increase in the seven day rolling average of new Covid 19 cases and in hospitalizations . 
The other counties that make up the Houston region did not see a similar spike . 
Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo last week called the county the " epicenter " of the virus in Texas .
