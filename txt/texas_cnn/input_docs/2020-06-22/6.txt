Gov . 
Greg Abbott said the coronavirus is " spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas " and warned that " tougher actions " may be imposed if the numbers continue to spike , but he stressed that closing down the state again " will always be the last option . " 
The governor outlined three categories that are spiking in Texas — daily positive cases , hospitalizations , and the positivity rate . 
Texas saw its largest daily increase of cases over the weekend , with 4,430 reported on Saturday , and the positivity rate jumped to nearly 9 % this weekend from 4.5 % in late May . " If we were to experience another doubling of those numbers over the next month , that would mean that we are in an urgent situation where tougher actions will be required to make sure that we do contain the spread of Covid 19 , " he said . 
For now , Abbott did not outline any rollbacks of his phased approach to reopening the state . 
Instead , the state will monitor whether recently developed actions — like the cracking down by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission on businesses that do not enforce reopening restrictions — will have any effect . 
Abbott also said the state is surging testing in hot spots and doing more to promote the wearing of masks , though still not making it a requirement .
