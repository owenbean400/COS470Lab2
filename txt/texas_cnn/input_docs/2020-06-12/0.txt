Judge Lina Hidalgo , the top elected official in Harris County , Texas — which includes the city of Houston — said the county saw its highest numbers of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations this week . 
Harris County is the third most populous county in the US . 
Hidalgo , who serves as its chief executive officer , warned the county " may be approaching the precipice of a disaster " in a press conference yesterday . 
Hidalgo said they are seeing the numbers increase as the state has started to reopen over the past few weeks . 
" I ’ve always said I think the reopening timeline was a little too fast . 
I would not have done it that quickly , " she said . 
She said that while there is enough hospital space right now , it ’s " alarming " that more than 15 % of ICU space is being occupied by Covid 19 patients . 
She is working with Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott ’s office and alerting the state on the latest numbers , she said .
