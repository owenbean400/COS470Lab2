Officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would not confirm on Friday whether there have been striking increases in Covid 19 hospitalizations in certain states , but said they will " monitor very closely " that metric and others during the coronavirus pandemic . 
The agency uses a number of metrics beyond hospitalization and testing numbers to track the outbreak , including intensive care admissions and " emergency department utilization for Covid like illness , " Butler said . 
" Because the test results in and of themselves only reflect a bit of the transmission that occurs . 
We know that some people do not develop symptoms . 
We know that of those who develop symptoms , not everyone will be tested , " he said . 
CDC Director Dr . Robert Redfield added that expanded testing in certain " vulnerable populations " such as nursing homes may also be contributing to the increases . 
Some background : On Wednesday , data that CNN aggregated from the Covid Tracking Project from May 25 to June 9 showed that the number of patients hospitalized due to coronavirus infection has gone up in at least a dozen states that are tracking hospitalization data : Alaska , Arkansas , Arizona , California , Kentucky , Mississippi , Montana , North Carolina , Oregon , South Carolina , Texas and Utah .
