The Advocare Classic , one of college football ’s marquee opening weekend games , has been called off . 
The matchup between powerhouses Alabama and the University of Southern California was set to be played in Arlington , Texas , on Sept . 5 . 
According to a news release issued by AT&T Stadium , the game was canceled due to conference scheduling policy changes . 
The Pac 12 conference had announced earlier this month that its teams , including the USC Trojans , would only play games within the conference due to the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The Alabama Crimson Tide play in the SEC . 
AT&T Stadium said fans who purchased tickets through the stadium ’s box offices will automatically be refunded within 10 to 14 business days . 
Tickets purchased via schools ’ ticket offices can be refunded once details surrounding the respective school ’s season are finalized .
