A federal judge in Texas is blocking for now an executive order that mandates that abortion clinics postpone elective surgeries , including abortion , during the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The court found that the order — as interpreted by the state ’s attorney general — violates the Constitution by " effectively banning all abortions before viability . " 
The court ’s order comes after Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott issued an order last week mandating that licensed health care facilities including abortion providers postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary . 
Clinics went to court seeking a temporary restraining order .
