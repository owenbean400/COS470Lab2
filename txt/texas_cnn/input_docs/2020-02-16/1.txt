One passenger on board the Diamond Princess said she was relieved that " somebody is coming for us , " after the US announced plans to fly American passengers home Sunday . 
The cruise ship is nearing the end of its two week quarantine at the Japanese port of Yokohama and authorities say all passengers will disembark sometime next week . 
Some Americans will leave early , with a flight for those who have not tested positive for the coronavirus or shown symptoms expected to leave Sunday evening Japan time . 
Once the passengers arrive in the US , they will be placed in another 14 day quarantine at one of two military bases in California and Texas . 
She said she was happy to enter a new quarantine in California , though some other passengers were " very upset " about the prospect . 
She was relieved to be out of the " failed quarantine " run by the Japanese authorities . 
The number of cases on the ship has risen considerably since it first docked in Yokohama . 
Courter and her husband have been trapped inside their cabin for almost two weeks . 
The biggest concern was the rising number of cases on board the ship .
