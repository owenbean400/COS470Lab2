One of the patients was taken to San Antonio and the other to Dallas , the judge said in a post on Facebook . 
" The local and valley hospitals are at full capacity and have no more beds available . 
I urge all of our residents to please shelter in place , wear face coverings , practice social distancing and AVOID GATHERINGS . "
