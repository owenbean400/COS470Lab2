Shelters in Texas will be stocked with PEE , use social distancing to separate people and have testing available , Gov . 
Greg Abbott said in a press conference as the state prepares for Hurricane Laura . 
Abbott said that he made a disaster declaration for 23 counties yesterday and will be adding 36 more to that list . 
The governor , who noted today is the third anniversary of when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas , said that there are more evacuations in the state than they had with Harvey . 
Abbott recommended that residents evacuate to hotels or motels if possible , but said that shelters will be ready and available if needed . 
The state is expecting high winds and up to a possible 10 foot water surge when the eye of the hurricane comes a shore , he said .
