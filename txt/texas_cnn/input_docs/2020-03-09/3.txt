Ted Cruz announced Sunday that they are both self quarantining after coming into contact with an individual at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) , who later tested positive for the virus . 
Gosar : The congressman said he was with the infected individual for " an extended period of time " and the two of them shook hands several times . 
Gosar said he has been in contact with the House physician , and said that he is closing his Washington office this week " out of an abundance of caution . " 
Cruz : The senator also said in a statement that his exposure to the individual had consisted of " a brief conversation and a handshake . " 
Cruz said he is " not experiencing any symptoms , " but that he will stay in Texas for 14 days " out of an abundance of caution . "
