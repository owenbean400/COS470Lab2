The US is heading in the wrong direction with Covid 19 numbers , and it 's doing so with astonishing speed . 
Just after 1,000 people died in a single day , the US is about to reach 4 million Covid 19 cases . 
To put that in perspective , the first reported case came on January 21 . 
After 99 days , 1 million Americans became infected . 
It took just 43 days after that to reach 2 million cases . 
And 28 days later , on July 8 , the US reached 3 million cases . 
Case number 4 million could be reported just two weeks after that . 
Here 's a look at how the total number of Covid 19 cases have progressed in the US , according to Johns Hopkins University data : While some US leaders , including President Trump , have pinned the spike in coronavirus numbers on increased testing , it 's actually the prevalence of the disease that 's causing cases to climb . 
A CNN analysis of testing data from the Covid Tracking Project reveals that the positive test rate — indicated by the average number of positive test results out of 1,000 tests performed — has increased significantly in many states that have seen the largest increases in new cases in recent weeks , including Florida , Arizona , Texas and Georgia . 
Florida , for instance , saw an average rate of 35 positive results per 1,000 tests during the month of May . But in June , that number nearly tripled to 105 . 
So far in July , the average rate has been 187 out of 1,000 . 
Over the weekend , nearly 50 hospitals across the state reported no ICU beds were left . 
The ICU bed availability statewide stood at about 15.98 % on Tuesday , down from about 18.1 % Monday .
