The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Tampa Bay Rays are facing off in the World Series . 
With the coronavirus pandemic , it 's a Fall Classic the likes of which we have never seen before . 
A limited number of fans are being allowed to attend , and it 's the first time the best of seven series is being played on a neutral site -- the newly opened Globe Life Field in Arlington , Texas . 
This is the 20th World Series appearance for the Dodgers , who competed for the title in three of the last four years . 
The team won six times , but not since 1988 . 
It 's just the second time the Rays have made it to the World Series , which they won in 2008 .
