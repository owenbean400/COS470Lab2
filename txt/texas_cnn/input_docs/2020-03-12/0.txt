Some lawmakers are not comfortable with gathering for all House member coronavirus briefings given the virus â€™ ability to spread , according to a source familiar with the situation . 
Some members feel the move is in direct conflict with the advice health officials have been giving to avoid large gatherings , the source said . 
Several members were already exposed to the virus at the Conservative Political Action Conference . 
One of those members , Rep . 
Louie Gohmert of Texas , has not been self quarantining despite being told by officials that he had been in proximity to the individual at CPAC who was diagnosed with novel coronavirus . 
Gohmert was on the Hill today . 
One question being raised is whether the briefings can be done via video conference .
