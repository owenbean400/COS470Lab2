Following Texas ' announcement that it will pause any further phases to reopen the state as Covid 19 cases increase , Austin Mayor Steve Adler says that " pausing will not make things better . " 
In Austin , the hospitalization count is more than 200 % higher than what it was two weeks ago , the mayor said . 
Adler said the state opened up before it had sufficient testing and tracing in place â€” but the key issue is that wearing masks is not mandatory in the state . 
" When you open up an economy , [ you have ] to couple that with religiously wearing face masks and religiously maintaining social distancing . 
That has to be part of opening up the economy , and that 's something that did not happen here , " he said . 
President Trump and Gov . 
Greg Abbott undercut the message to wear masks , Adler said , and that people in the state need to change their behavior now . 
" Our governor wears face masks . 
The problem is that by not making it mandatory , even he sends a conflicting message . 
We have to make it mandatory , " Adler said .
