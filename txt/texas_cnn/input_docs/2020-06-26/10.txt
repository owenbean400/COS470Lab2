The White House announced that Vice President Mike Pence would lead a public coronavirus task force briefing today at 12:30 p.m . ET , the first public meeting in almost two months . 
The last formal briefing was held on April 27 . 
Today 's briefing comes as at least 32 states are seeing an increase in cases of Covid 19 , and California , Oklahoma and Texas are seeing fresh high peaks . 
The briefing will not take place at the White House , but at the Department of Health and Human Services , according to a schedule released by the White House . 
In recent days , President Trump has tried to declare the pandemic " over " despite the rising numbers , and has instead focused his administration 's energy on reopening the economy . 
Since Pence was tapped to lead the coronavirus task force on February 27 , there have been a total of 47 briefings at the White House , most led by President Trump , and a few led by the vice president . 
Note : This briefing count does not include a Rose Garden event in which President Trump touted the administration 's testing efforts on May 11 , since it was not an official coronavirus task force briefing .
