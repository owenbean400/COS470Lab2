There are at least 18,056 cases of coronavirus in Houston and at least 216 people have died from the virus in the city , Mayor Sylvester Turner said during a news conference on Friday . 
The current surge in Covid 19 cases in Houston is real and it is serious , Turner added . 
The Texas city has seen increases in hospitalizations , intensive care unit numbers and the number of young people testing positive for Covid 19 , according to Turner . 
" I do support the government 's decision to close bars and reduce restaurants capacity from the current closed bars completely for now , " Turner said . 
Some context : The mayor ’s comments comes after Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott issued an executive order Friday in an effort to contain the spread of Covid 19 in the state . 
The new order places strict limitations on businesses and services . 
Bars that get more than 51 % of their gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages must close today , among other measures . 
Turner added that he 's working on a " wall of shame " for businesses that are caught not following the governor ’s new order . 
The " wall of shame " will include posting onto the city 's social media site and onto a huge board during news conferences , Turner said .
