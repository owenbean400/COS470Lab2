Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott issued an executive order today that limits certain businesses and services as part of the state â€™s effort to " contain the spread of Covid 19 . " 
Texas is among at least 11 states seeing a 50 % increase or more in cases compared to the previous week . 
Here is what the order includes : All bars that get more than 51 % of their gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages are required to close at 12:00 p.m . today . 
These businesses may remain open for delivery and take out , including for alcoholic beverages , as authorized by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission . 
Restaurants can remain open for dine in service , but their capacities can not exceed 50 % of total listed indoor occupancy , beginning on Monday . 
Rafting and tubing businesses must close . 
Outdoor gatherings of 100 or more people must be approved by local governments , with certain exceptions . 
" As I said from the start , if the positivity rate rose above 10 % , the State of Texas would take further action to mitigate the spread of Covid 19 , " Abbott said in a statement . 
" At this time , it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities , including Texans congregating in bars . 
The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and protect public health . "
