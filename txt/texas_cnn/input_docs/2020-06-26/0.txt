As confirmed coronavirus cases spike in the western United States , the governor of New Mexico says they are putting further economic reopening plans on hold . 
While New Mexico ’s case load has not gotten as dramatically high as its neighbors , Arizona and Texas , Grisham said there is still too much risk . 
" We can manage being flat . 
Our goal should be to reduce cases , " the governor said . 
Grisham said " the last thing anyone wants " is to have to roll back economic progress since businesses began to reopen . 
" The virus has not gone anywhere . 
I think there ’s a false sense of security now , " the governor said . 
" New Mexicans actually have gotten really lax , I think , about wearing masks and taking this seriously . "
