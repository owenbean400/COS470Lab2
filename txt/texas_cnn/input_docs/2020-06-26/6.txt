On Monday , White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned that the country would have to learn to live with " hotspots " popping up around the country in places like Texas , which saw a record number of cases today . 
But Dr . Jonathan Reiner , a professor of medicine at George Washington University , argued the idea did not portray just how widespread the virus ' spikes are . 
He added that parts of states like Texas will have to shut down , since there is a risk that hospitals will be overrun . 
" That would be the responsible thing to do and I ’m hoping the leadership in those states has the political courage to do that , " he said . 
" It has to come from the statehouses and we have to have the courage to shut down places where the virus is out of control . 
There ’s no other way to do it . "
