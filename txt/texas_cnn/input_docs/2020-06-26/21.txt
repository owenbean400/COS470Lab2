More than 120,000 courses of remdesivir have been distributed to all of 50 states , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at today 's coronavirus task force briefing . 
Remdesivir is the only drug known to work against Covid 19 . 
While not a blockbuster drug , a study shows it shaves four days off a hospital stay , from 15 to 11 days . 
Some background : In May , the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir , an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola but now used on hospitalized Covid patients . 
In early May , the government distributed a small amount of remdesivir directly to about two dozen hospitals nationwide without explaining why those hospitals were chosen over others . 
Following an outcry , HHS started to distribute remdesivir to state health departments , but questions still remained . 
For example , the week of May 4 , California and Texas received the same amount of remdesivir , even though California had far more coronavirus patients . 
While HHS did not originally disclose where remdesivir was going , the agency is now publishing on its website how much drug is going to each state .
