Vice President Mike Pence asserted Friday that " all 50 states and territories across this country are opening up safely and responsibly " even as cases surge in many states , and eight states across the country have paused their reopening efforts . 
One state , Texas , has even scaled back their reopening plan , closing bars after they had been a part of the states reopening plan . 
Pence said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday that the country has " made truly remarkable progress in moving our nation forward " and that " we 've all seen the encouraging news as we open up America again . " 
His remarks come as 32 states across the country have seen an increase in cases over the past week , according to data from John Hopkins University . 
Pence also discussed the return of jobs that came with reopening America , and said that some of the original coronavirus hotspots such as the New York metro area and New Orleans have made " extraordinary progress . " 
He said the task force is focusing on 16 states that have been most impacted by coronavirus in recent weeks with both rising cases and rising positivity rates . 
Pence also repeated the President 's refrain that more testing has led to more cases , however the rise in new cases has outpaced the increase in coronavirus testing . 
" To one extent or another , the volume of new cases coming in is a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country , " Pence said . 
Pence said that while the US has made progress , the country " still has work to do . "
