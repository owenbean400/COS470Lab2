Lina Hidalgo , judge of Harris County , Texas , which includes the city of Houston , is advocating for a stay at home order in her county as coronavirus cases rise . 
Hidalgo , the chief administrator of the county , said that she does not want to shut the economy again , but a patchwork method wo not quell coronavirus in the long run . 
" A long term solution based on data instead of wishful thinking is what 's going to put our economy in the position to succeed , " Hidalgo told CNN ’s Kate Bolduan . 
Texas has more than 200,000 Covid 19 cases , and Harris County has more than 37,000 cases so far . 
Hidalgo said that a mask mandate will not solely bring the number of cases down , which is why she ’s looking for a stay at home order as well . 
" We ca not just put our head in the sand and hope that somehow it ’s going to go differently over here , " she said .
