A Texas man , Adam Stadler , said his second bout of coronavirus was " a hundred times worse than the first time . " 
Stadler experienced muscles aches , fatigue , joint pains , shortness of breath and loss of sense and smell . 
Stadler says he first got sick with coronavirus back on March 29 . 
A month later , he got so sick that he was hospitalized for 10 days and developed a pulmonary embolism . 
He then tested negative twice , developed shingles , and tested positive for coronavirus again on June 21 . 
His physician Dr . Joseph Varon , chief of staff at Union Memorial Medical Center in Houston , said Stadler ’s case shows that people still need to be vigilant . 
Asked if Stadler 's two negative Covid 19 tests could have been false negatives and therefore he did not catch the virus again , Varon said it was a possibility . 
Stadler 's wife also developed symptoms , and she was diagnosed with double pneumonia . 
Stadler said his son still considers coronavirus a " hoax , " and he wishes his son would wear a mask and socially distance . 
" This has been the worst three or four months that I have ever experienced in my life , " Stadler said . 
He ’s on short term disability with his job , and he ’s thankful he and his wife had a bit of money saved up to tide them over . 
Stadler said he is still feeling the cognitive effects of the virus . 
Important note : Doctors are still undecided on whether Covid 19 reinfection can occur this early in the pandemic . 
While top infectious disease experts say it is likely that there is some degree of immunity from a prior infection , it is unclear how long that could last . 
So , what may appear to be " reinfection " could just be non infectious traces of the virus , which have been known to linger in some patients for upwards of 6 to 8 weeks . 
It is also possible that a patient may have had a false positive antibody test , and that a later Covid 19 infection is in fact their first .
