The Trump campaign has postponed Vice President Mike Pence 's campaign events in Florida and Arizona next week " out of an abundance of caution , " the campaign told CNN . 
The decision to postpone the events comes as both states and the country experience a surge in coronavirus cases . 
Pence had a handful of campaign and political related events scheduled as part of his trips to both states . 
The Vice President 's office did not provide an updated schedule for Pence 's trips . 
The Associated Press and NBC first reported the schedule changes . 
During Friday ’s White House coronavirus task force briefing Pence said that he will be traveling to Texas , Arizona and Florida , three of the states hardest hit in recent weeks by the pandemic , so he could " get a ground report . " 
Pence on Sunday will travel to Dallas where he will speak at First Baptist Church to participate in a " Celebrate Freedom Rally , " which his office bills as a celebration of American freedom and spirit . 
He will then meet with Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott about Covid 19 . 
When pressed Friday by reporters over the wisdom of holding campaign rallies , even as public health officials continue to warn against large gatherings , Pence described it as a personal decision outside the government 's purview . 
" We have an election coming up this fall , " Pence said . 
" And President Trump and I believe that , taking proper steps — we created screening at recent events — and giving people the very best counsel that we have , we still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process . 
And we respect that . "
