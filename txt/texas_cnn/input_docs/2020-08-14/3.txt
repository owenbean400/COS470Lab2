Michigan Gov . 
Gretchen Whitmer announced four million free masks will be provided to the state 's most vulnerable residents , through a partnership with Ford Motor Company and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) . 
The measure is part of Michigan 's " Mask up Michigan " campaign , and masks will be distributed to schools , homeless shelters and seniors , Whitmer said . 
Whitmer juxtaposed the swift mitigation action taken in her state against the response in Florida and Georgia throughout the pandemic . 
" Georgia was the first state in the country to reopen its economy , and is now averaging five times the number of new cases of coronavirus in a day , five times more than the state of Michigan . 
And while states like Georgia and Florida and Texas reported hundreds of new deaths last week , Michigan had 43 , " Whitmer said .
