The Dodgers have returned to Los Angeles , but without third baseman Justin Turner , a team spokesman told CNN on Wednesday . 
Dodgers spokesman Joe Jareck said that the rest of the team flew home Wednesday , since they were cleared by county authorities . 
Turner was pulled in the middle of his team 's World Series securing Game 6 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington , Texas on Tuesday after testing positive for Covid 19 . 
He initially did not join his teammates on the field for the post game celebrations and tweeted : " Ca not believe I could not be out there to celebrate with my guys ! " 
However , he did eventually return to the field to celebrate , hugging his teammates , posing for photos with the roster and at times not wearing a mask , which has led to both the 35 year old third baseman and the Dodgers organization coming in for criticism . 
An investigation by the commissioner 's office is now underway and both the Rays and Dodgers were tested again today , the MLB said . 
" I do not think there was anyone that was going to stop him from going out ( onto the field ) , " Andrew Friedman , the Dodgers president of baseball operations , told reporters after the game .
