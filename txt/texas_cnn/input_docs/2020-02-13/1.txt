Late yesterday , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would remake part of the novel coronavirus test kit that it has distributed to states . 
The hope was that states could test samples more quickly than sending them to the CDC lab in Atlanta – but some of the kits that were distributed had inconclusive results . 
What this means : Testing results may be delayed . 
Speeding up the testing process has been a priority for the CDC , according to Dr . Nancy Messonnier , the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases . 
" During a response like this we know things may not go as smoothly as we would like , " Messonnier said during a press conference yesterday . 
" We have multiple levels of quality control to detect issues just like this one . 
We ’re looking into all of these issues to understand what went wrong , and to prevent these same things from happening in the future . " 
Texas , Michigan and Arizona are among the states that are awaiting the new materials for the novel coronavirus testing kit , state health officials told CNN .
