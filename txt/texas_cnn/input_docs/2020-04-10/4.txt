The most recent version of an influential coronavirus model – which is often cited by the White House – projects that some states , such as New York and New Jersey , have passed their peaks in terms of daily deaths . 
New York ’s peak number of deaths , for example , is listed as April 9 on the model . 
New Jersey ’s peak is listed as April 8 . 
Other large states are now approaching their peaks , according to the model , which was developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine . 
California is expected to hit peak daily deaths within a week , on April 15 . 
The state is expected to see 66 deaths that day . 
Pennsylvania is expected to follow a similar trajectory , hitting peak deaths on April 17 , when 63 people are projected to die . 
For other large states – such as Florida and Texas – the worst is expected to come later . 
Florida ’s peak is expected to come on April 27 ; roughly 112 people are projected to die that day . 
Texas is predicted to hit its peak on April 28 , when 66 lives are expected to be lost . 
Some context : While it ’s unclear when exactly the state expects to return to normal , lifting social distancing measures too soon – before the peak , for example – could reignite transmission of the virus and cost lives . 
The current version of the model says it expects social distancing until the end of May , and assumes that states will enact other measures – such as mass screening and contact tracing – that will prevent any resurgence of the virus . 
The institute previously told CNN that the projections assumed social distancing until August , as the model ’s FAQ had stated in now deleted language . 
But on Thursday , the institute ’s director , Chris Murray , said that was not actually the case – despite what a professor behind the model and an institute spokesperson had both said earlier .
