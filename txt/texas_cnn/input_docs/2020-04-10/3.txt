The city of Houston is closing its parks and trails for the weekend to try to keep people from spreading the coronavirus over the Easter holiday â€” and officers will be out watching for violators . 
Police Chief Art Acevedo said in a Friday afternoon press conference they will be out " on foot , on bicycles , on specialized vehicles and on horseback " to look for people violating the rules and are prepared to issue citations . 
Acevedo said they have enough manpower to monitor the parks despite having 82 officers under quarantine . 
Under a state order , Texas churches can hold in person Easter services as long as social distancing rules are followed , but Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said at the news conference that he hopes they wo not . 
" It 's not an issue of fear , " Turner said . 
" It 's an issue of keeping the members safe . "
