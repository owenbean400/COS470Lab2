The US federal government will still fund and staff some state coronavirus testing sites if needed , Vice President Mike Pence said at a task force briefing today . 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) plans to transition from community based testing sites to a state led operation . 
States will have the option to manage their own sites , but can also request the federal government to play a role . 
So far , New Jersey , Louisiana , Illinois , Colorado and Texas have requested " continued federal participation , " said Pence . 
CNN earlier reported that the move has received mixed reactions from states . 
While some localities may need federal support , others have already moved toward managing their own sites . 
FEMA said in a statement to CNN that it was working to " transition these sites to become state managed by this Friday , April 10 , " adding that the " federal government is poised to ensure states are fully supported until they are ready to take over management . "
