Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner asked the community to take several steps to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus during a news conference Thursday . 
Turner asked that people follow the recommendations for the next three weeks — including wearing masks whenever people are around , not just in businesses , ensuring social distancing in the workplace or working from home , and reducing business occupancy from 50 % to 25 % — to help " blunt the progression " of coronavirus in Houston . 
These recommendations come as the city has reached a 25 % positivity rate , Houston Health Department Health Authority Dr . David Persse said . 
" The virus is very much out there , " Persse said . 
" It 's very much actively spreading . " 
Turner also asked that people reduce social gatherings to no more than 10 people ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend . 
The mayor has also asked faith communities to resume virtual services in place of in person services to help mitigate the spread of the virus . 
The city is producing a virtual Fourth of July show , Turner said . 
Turner 's request came the same day that Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott mandated masks in public spaces statewide for counties with 20 or more positive case . 
Abbott also issued a proclamation giving mayors and county judges the ability to impose restrictions on outdoor gathering of over 10 people .
