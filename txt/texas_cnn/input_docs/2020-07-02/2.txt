Doctors and nurses at San Antonio ’s Methodist Hospital are overwhelmed by the sharp increase in coronavirus patients — and are bracing for even more cases after the Fourth of July weekend . 
Pulmonary disease physician Dr . Jeffrey Dellavolpe said he ’s lost track of how many patients with Covid 19 in their 20s are coming in . 
" The last few weeks has just been overwhelming , is how I would describe it . 
There 's been more and more patients than we really know what to do with . 
The patients are getting younger , and they 're more sick , " he said . 
Dellavlope said that he got 10 calls in one day of people who could be on a procedure to oxygenate blood and keep patients off ventilators , and he only had three beds available . 
ER physician Dr . Jennifer Gemmill said patients are being held in the emergency department for hours or even days , due to the lack of available beds . 
" I do not think that there was one specific incidence that really led to this spike . 
I think people after March and April were extremely frustrated with being inside , and as soon as those restrictions lifted , they wanted to get out . 
Some protected themselves , some did not . 
And now we 're just seeing the result of that , " Gemmill said .
