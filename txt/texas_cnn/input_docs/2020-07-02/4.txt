The current spike in new coronavirus numbers is due to an increase in cases , not because of more testing , Admiral Dr . Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday . 
Giroir the US we did flatten the curve earlier during the pandemic , but " we are not flattening the curve right now , the curve is still going up . " 
Across the US , some states are doing better than others , Giroir said , " four states are counting for about 50 % of our new cases , and they 're very concerning to all in public health . " 
Those states are California , Arizona , Texas and Florida – which all posted record new cases this week , according to Johns Hopkins data . 
Giroir , who has recently been critical of younger generations said , " we really do believe the current outbreak is primarily due to under 35s , with a lot of gatherings and not appropriate protection – like masks . "
