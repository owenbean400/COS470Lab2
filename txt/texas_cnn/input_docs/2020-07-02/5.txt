As the number of coronavirus cases surges in Texas , Austin Mayor Steve Adler says he is weighing a 35 day stay at home order for the state capital . 
" We ’re putting it on the table , " he told CNN ’s Kate Bolduan . 
" We could easily be maxed out in our hospitals and our ICUs within two weeks , having to open up field hospitals in our city , " Adler said . 
The community does not want to go back to a lockdown , he said , but a 35 day stay at home order would allow the city to stem the tide now , as well as prepare adequately for reopening again . 
Even if Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott does not approve the order , Adler said the city would go ahead with protective measures . 
" That mixed messaging is killing us , " he said .
