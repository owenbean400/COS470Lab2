At least 12 states are seeing a rise in daily hospitalizations , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week . 
The trend is worrying : A sharp increase in patients can once again overwhelm hospitals , putting critical resources including staffing , beds and ventilators in short supply . 
Some hospitals are already so swamped they 've transferred patients elsewhere , while others are taking steps to prepare for a coming surge . 
The increases come weeks after many states began reopening their economies after extended closures intended to stem the spread of coronavirus . 
Meanwhile , at least 37 states across the country are seeing an increase in Covid 19 cases compared to the previous week , according to John Hopkins University data . 
The relaxed measures fueled the rapid spread of the virus and an influx of new patients needing hospitalization , some doctors say . 
" I live close to a beach , and you can see it 's like a party every single day , " says Dr . David De La Zerda , the ICU medical director and a pulmonologist at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami . 
Among the states seeing an increase are Florida and Texas , which are expected to see nearly 2,000 new hospitalizations per day by mid July , according to forecasts published by the CDC . 
In Arizona and California , the forecasts project about 1,500 new patients each day in the next two weeks . 
Arizona hospital beds are currently at 85 % capacity and ICU beds are " only " at 88 % capacity , Vice President Mike Pence said during a briefing in Phoenix on Wednesday . 
The state is also asking for 500 additional medical personnel to deal with what Pence called a " dramatic " surge in coronavirus cases in the state . 
Here is a look at some of the latest hospitalization figures :
