The mayor of Houston , Texas , Sylvester Turner , said " we have to pump the brakes " on relaxing coronavirus restrictions after seeing images of crowds not complying with social distancing over the weekend . 
In response to the crowds , Turner announced yesterday that he will enforce the 25 % capacity rule in bars and clubs –– two days after saying the rule would not be enforced . 
The city also will enforce the 50 % rule for restaurants , he said . 
Turner said if businesses do not voluntarily comply with the capacity rules , the city can close the establishment for that particular night . 
He said they received 180 complaints yesterday . 
" The fire marshals went out , talked to the establishments , the managers or the owners and in all cases where they went out , the people agreed to voluntarily comply , " Turner said . 
" That 's a good sign and we 're hoping that others will follow suit . " 
The latest predictions : Texas is one of a handful of southern states at risk of seeing a rapid surge of new coronavirus cases in some areas , according to a new projection model . 
That model predicts that Harris County , which includes Houston , could see more than 2,000 new cases each day by June .
