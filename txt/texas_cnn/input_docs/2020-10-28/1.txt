It 's uncertain if the Los Angeles Dodgers will be able to fly home or have to go into quarantine after third baseman Justin Turner tested positive for the coronavirus , according to Andrew Friedman , the team 's president of baseball operations . 
" Not sure yet , " Friedman told reporters . 
" We ’re going back tonight ( to the hotel ) and we ’re going to all take tests and figure out what the results are from that and then go from there . " 
The Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-1 in Game 6 to win the best of seven series four games to two and claim the World Series in Arlington , Texas on Tuesday . 
Turner was removed during the game , but later returned to the field to celebrate with his teammates and the World Series trophy .
