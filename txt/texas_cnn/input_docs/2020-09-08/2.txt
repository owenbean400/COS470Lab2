To increase the supply of remdesivir for the treatment of Covid 19 in the United States , Rep . 
Lloyd Doggett , a Democrat from Texas , and the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen are calling for President Trump to let generic drug makers produce the drug . 
Gilead , the California company that makes remdesivir , has exclusive rights to sell the drug in the US . 
The situation is different in other countries . 
" There are manufactures in India and Pakistan and the United Kingdom that have been safely producing generic remdesivir in over 100 countries . 
Unfortunately , we ’re not one of them , " Doggett said during a virtual news conference hosted by the advocacy groups Pr EP4All Collaboration , Public Citizen and Social Security Works . 
About the supply in the US : About 38 hospitals in 12 states have reported shortages of remdesivir since July , according to a report by Public Citizen . 
Doctors on the call expressed concern over shortages of remdesivir in the US . 
" We do not have enough remdesivir nationally , " said Dr . Rochelle Walensky , chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital , and a CNN medical analyst . 
" There simply is not enough of it to go around . 
Dr . Thomas Patterson , chief of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio , said his hospital faced shortages of remdesivir during a surge of Covid 19 in August . 
" We received enough remdesivir to treat less than a third of the admitted patients — so a really woefully inadequate supply , " Patterson said . 
US hospitals do not directly purchase remdesivir the way they do other drugs . 
Because there is not enough to go around , the US Department of Health and Human Services regularly ships remdesivir to states , which then deliver the drugs to hospitals .
