Tesla filed a suit Saturday night against Alameda County , California , after local officials there refused to let the company reopen its Fremont factory . 
In a series of tweets earlier Saturday , Tesla CEO Elon Musk also threatened to move the company 's headquarters to Texas or Nevada , where shelter in place rules are less restrictive . 
" Frankly , this is the final straw . 
Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately , " Musk tweeted . 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday . 
The automaker had planned to allow a fraction of its factory workers to return to work by Friday , but was warned by the Alameda County Health Department in a livestreamed town hall on Friday that such a move would be violating the county 's rules . 
" This has been a collaborative , good faith effort to develop and implement a safety plan that allows for reopening while protecting the health and well being of the thousands of employees who travel to and from work at Tesla 's factory , " the Alameda Health Department responded on Saturday in a statement to CNN Business . 
" The team at Tesla has been responsive to our guidance and recommendations , and we look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon . "
