Some lawyers are offering free legal services to help health care workers draw up wills during the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Attorney Natalie Elisha Gold , CEO of Gold Legal Group , said she was inspired to offer free services by her own sister , a nurse in Manhattan . 
Her firm , which operates in New York , New Jersey and California , has received an " extraordinarily high volume " of roughly 200 inquiries so far , with about 40 health care workers embarking on the will process , Gold explained . 
Gold said she created an online system that would allow people to submit their information immediately . 
They ’ve also heard from health care workers and first responders in Alabama , Texas , Ohio and Pennsylvania , she added . 
" I am so grateful to Natalie for her dedication to helping health care workers , especially in a time like this , " said Dr . Alexandra Volo , a family medicine physician based Pennsylvania . 
" It ’s very important to have a last will and testament to know exactly what our wishes are , especially in a time like this . " 
" We do not have a magic 8 ball , you do not know what ’s going to happen in the future , " Volo added . 
Volo just came back to work following the birth of her child , now 4 months old . 
She works at Penn State Health St . Joseph in Redding , Pennsylvania , roughly an hour away from Philadelphia . 
The hospital is seeing a surge of patients , Volo said .
