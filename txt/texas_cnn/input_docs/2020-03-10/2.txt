One of music 's largest events will be delayed over coronavirus concerns . 
The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival organizers will postpone the event , potentially until October , two sources with knowledge of the matter tell CNN . 
The festival , which typically attracts about 100,000 attendees per day , had been set to take place on two weekends : April 10-12 and April 17-19 in Indio , California . 
CNN has reached out to representatives for Coachella for comment . 
A date change would follow last week 's cancellation of South by Southwest in Austin , Texas . 
Both events , which attract hundreds of thousands of visitors , join a host of others — from concert tour legs to conferences — that have canceled or rescheduled as the number of global cases of coronavirus continues to climb . 
Rage Against the Machine , Travis Scott and Frank Ocean were scheduled to headline Coachella . 
It is not yet known if they would perform in October . 
Other artists set to perform had included Calvin Harris , Big Sean , Lewis Capaldi , Charlie XCX , Flume , 21 Savage , Lana Del Rey and Lil Nas X .
