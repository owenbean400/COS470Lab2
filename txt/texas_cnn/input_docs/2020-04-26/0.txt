The Jefferson County District Attorney ’s Office in Texas is investigating Beaumont Mayor Becky Ames ’ trip to a nail salon , Pat Knauth from the DA ’s office told CNN affiliate KFDM . 
According to the affiliate , the investigation comes at the request of the county judge , Jeff Branick . 
This comes after a photo was posted to social media of Ames soaking her nails in a bowl on Tuesday . 
Ames and the nail salon owner told KFDM that the mayor was not having her nails done but was " soaking them in acetone to remove the powdered nails to avoid infection . " 
" I had them put on several weeks ago and they hurt . 
I was trying to get them off and I texted my nail lady . 
She said the only way to get them off is with a solution . 
You have to do it a special way , " Ames told KFDM . 
The mayor said she went to the closed salon , and planned to pick up solution that would be left outside the door in order to take it home and remove the artificial nails . 
She said the owner had her come in for a matter of minutes to show her how to do the process , and that they were alone , both wearing masks and at least six feet apart , and then she left within minutes , according to KFDM Ames issued an apology on Thursday , for entering the nail salon despite stay at home orders that were still in place for businesses like salons , calling it a " lapse in judgement . " 
On Thursday , Texas governor Greg Abbott previewed his upcoming announcement on Monday for how Texas will further reopen the economy , saying " so many different types of businesses , " including hair salons , will open up .
