What a difference a week makes . 
On Monday , it looked like nothing was going to happen on stimulus . 
Now , it 's possible a deal is brokered in a matter of days . 
It 's crunch time . 
If a bipartisan group of lawmakers is actually going to unlock a stimulus agreement and present it in writing by Monday , there is a lot of work left to do . 
Here 's what 's happening now : Aides familiar with the process tell CNN that members are working around the clock and have broken into teams to hammer out specific sections of the bill . 
Democratic Sen . 
Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Sen . 
John Cornyn of Texas are quietly working on a compromise for the liability insurance section . 
Utah Republican Sen . 
Mitt Romney and Democratic Sen . 
Joe Manchin of West Virginia are working on a formula that could work for state and local governments , including possibly setting a cap at how much any one state could receive . 
The intention would be to block large states from getting as much money as they might have gotten in the last round based on the old formula . 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc Connell has made it clear , according to multiple aides involved , that he 'd like to see a proposal Monday . 
That 's what Manchin has said publicly , too . 
So what 's actually in the plan ? 
The proposal includes : $ 300 a week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits ( there is still a debate about how retroactive this could be ) A continued pause on student loan payments Eviction moratorium Another round of money for the Paycheck Protection Program $ 16 billion for vaccine development and distribution and Covid 19 testing and tracing Extension of unemployment programs that allowed gig workers to file for unemployment insurance Extension of the program that allows unemployed Americans to get 39 weeks instead of 26
