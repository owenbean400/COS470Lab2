Texas Rep . 
Louie Gohmert provided an update on how he 's feeling since contracting Covid 19 . 
When asked if he ’s taking a combination of hydroxychloroquine , azithromycin and zinc , which he had previously said he planned to take , Gohmert said , " Yep , " adding , " It ’s all been extremely helpful . 
The only residual thing is I ’m a little raspy , my voice is a little raspier . 
Some context : The Food and Drug Administration has concluded hydroxychloroquine is not helpful and might harm patients ; 
National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the World Healh Organization have stopped hydroxychloroquine trials because of all the evidence it does not help coronavirus patients . 
The administration ’s own top health experts – Dr . Anthony Fauci , Dr . Deborah Birx and Adm . Brett Giroir – have all stated unequivocally and repeatedly that hydroxychloroquine is not beneficial .
