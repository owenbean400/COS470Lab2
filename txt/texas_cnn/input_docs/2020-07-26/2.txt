White House officials painted a rosy picture of the nation 's economic recovery on Sunday as the administration continues to negotiate a new phase of coronavirus relief legislation with Senate Republicans and the US prepares to enter its sixth month of the pandemic . 
Kudlow mentioned a slew of indicators of recovery , including booms in the housing , retail and auto markets and a rise in new business applications . 
He claimed " the jobs picture remains strong , " calling last week 's rise in unemployment claims a " seasonal adjustment problem . " 
" I do not know the July number . 
We 'll learn it in a week or so , but I do think that the odds favor a big increase in job creation and a big reduction in unemployment , " Kudlow said . 
More context : In an interview on Fox News Sunday , Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said " we always said the second quarter was going to be a very bad quarter . " 
However , he said he still believes the third quarter will be much better , " we expect the third quarter , the consensus is 17 % GDP , so we do think you are going to see a very big rebound . " 
" There are parts of the economy that are doing very well , there are parts of the economy that are not , " Mnuchin said . 
He also noted " we got to 30 " million Americans unemployed , " but we never got to 40 or 60 . " 
He said that since then the US has created almost 10 million jobs . 
Kudlow acknowledged that in hot spot states like Texas , Arizona , Florida and California there will be " some impact " on recovery , but he said he does not think it will be " huge . " 
The second quarter GDP numbers will be released this Thursday .
