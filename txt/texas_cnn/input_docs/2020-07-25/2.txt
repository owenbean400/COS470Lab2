Before the storm made landfall Saturday , Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott discussed the challenges the state is still facing with coronavirus and the storm . 
" Any hurricane is an enormous challenge , " he said . 
" This challenge is complicated and made even more severe , seeing that is sweeping through an area that is the most challenging area in the state for Covid 19 . " 
Abbott said that during hurricanes and severe weather people " will come together , come together to shelter , come together as just close family , come together as friends , come together to respond . " 
" That coming together will continue to provide the ability for Covid 19 to transmit form one person to another , " he said .
