The recent fluctuation in the Texas positivity rate is attributable to a myriad of coding errors by labs , an upgrade in the state 's data processing system , and a decrease in demand at free community testing sites , according to Lara Anton , spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services . 
As CNN has reported , the positive infection rate jumped from 12 % at the end of July to nearly 25 % last week . 
It 's now back down to 11.25 % . 
The governor announced last week the state was investigating the massive spike . 
Anton told CNN on Monday that a large number of test results came in at the beginning of last week after a coding error was detected by the state in a major lab 's reporting process . 
After that backlog of results started pouring in last week , this caused a spike in the positivity rate because the positive cases had gotten out of sync with other test results . 
Two days later , they got another backlog of results from a large hospital system , which decreased the rate . 
Over the weekend , a national pharmacy chain fixed a data error that also led to a decrease in the positivity rate . 
Additionally , a system upgrade on Aug . 1 started allowing the state to process more than 100,000 tests a day , which is also partly why the state is able to process these backlogs . 
Anton said the state is still investigating other potential factors that have caused data fluctuations in recent weeks and making sure other labs and hospitals do not have coding errors . 
It 's unclear yet whether we 'll see more backlogs pour in .
