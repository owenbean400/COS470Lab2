Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said his main priority is to keep people safe as some lockdown measures in Texas began to ease on Friday . 
People in Dallas are " putting their toe back in " and " are not pouring back into these restaurants and into movie theaters and malls and things because they do not feel like it 's safe to do so , " Johnson said . 
The mayor also expressed skepticism about the prospects of a speedy return to the " normal " of three months ago , as President Trump has suggested would be possible . 
Johnson called that prospect " unrealistic . " 
" It 's impossible to say what we think is going to happen in the next few months . 
But I think this , I think it 's unrealistic to believe that we 're going to be able to be shoulder to shoulder here anymore soon , " Johnson said .
