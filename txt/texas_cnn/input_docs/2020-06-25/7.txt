An executive order was issued today by Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott meant to ensure hospital bed availability for Covid 19 patients in parts of Texas . 
The order suspends all elective surgeries in hospitals in 4 counties that are home to the cities of San Antonio , Dallas , Houston and Austin . 
Under the order , any procedure that is not immediately and medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the life of a patient will be postponed . 
Additionally , the Governor can add or subtract more counties from the list to address surges in hospitalizations . 
Texas is among at least 13 states that are reporting a 50 % increase or higher increase in cases . 
There are fears of " apocalyptic " surges in major Texas cities if spikes in cases continue .
