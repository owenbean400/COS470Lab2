Maggie Sillero was 28 weeks pregnant when she found out she had coronavirus . 
The Texas mom was asymptomatic , and even she said she was scared , she said she was not worried because she knew she was in great hands with her doctors and nurses . 
Her babies , a daughter and two sons , are doing well . 
She has been able to bring her daughter home and she was told yesterday that her sons might be able to leave the hospital tomorrow . 
Between the time she tested positive and when she gave birth , she was isolated from the rest of her family for a month for everyone ’s safety . 
She said she was relived to get two negative Covid 19 tests before giving birth . 
Her husband did not receive his negative test in time for the birth , so he could not be in the room with her , but Sillero ’s mother was able to be there with her .
