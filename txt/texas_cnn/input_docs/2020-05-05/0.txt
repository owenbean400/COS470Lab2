A man accused of shoving an Austin , Texas , park ranger into the water while the ranger was explaining to a crowd the need for social distancing is embarrassed by his actions , his lawyer said . 
A video that gained attention after it was posted on social media includes the moment a young man pushes the ranger into a lake at Commons Ford Ranch Metro Park last Thursday afternoon . 
Brandon Hicks , 25 , faces a charge of attempted assault on a public servant , a state jail felony , said the Travis County Sheriff 's Office . 
According to an arrest affidavit , ranger Cassidy Stillwell was talking to a crowd of people , described as " unlawfully drinking and smoking , " on a dock near Lake Austin . 
It 's unclear from the affidavit whether Hicks was part of that group mentioned in the affidavit . 
Amid the cross talk in the video , Stillwell is heard telling the crowd on the dock to " disperse yourselves " in the grassy area nearby because they were not maintaining physical distance of six feet . 
Some respond with " Will do " and " I got you , man . " 
The ranger 's instructions are interrupted when the man pushes him into the shallow , murky water . 
The ranger holds on to the man 's arm and pulls him in , the video shows . 
The man , clad in a swimsuit , scrambles out of the water and rushes away . 
Attorney Mark Hull told CNN in a statement Monday he looks forward to telling Hicks ' side of the story . 
Texas has reported at least 32,781 coronavirus cases , including 901 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University .
