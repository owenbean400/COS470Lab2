The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation is investigating several complaints that a nail salon provided services to Beaumont Mayor Becky Ames despite the governor â€™s executive order closing hair and nail salons , Tela Goodwin Mange , the public information officer with the agency said . 
This comes after a photo surfaced on social media last week showing Ames in a nail salon soaking her hands in a bowl . 
At the time of the visit , there were executive orders in place requiring salons to remain closed because of the Covid 19 crisis . 
Ames told CNN affiliate KFDM that she was not having her nails done , but had gone to the salon to pick up solution needed to remove her artificial nails because " they hurt . " 
Once at the salon , the mayor said the owner had her come in for a few minutes to show her how to perform the process . 
Ames said she and the owner of the salon were alone in the closed salon , both wearing masks , at least six feet apart , before she left within minutes , according to KFDM . 
The Jefferson County District Attorney 's Office is planning to investigate the mayor 's actions . 
Ames issued an apology on Thursday , for entering the nail salon , calling it a " lapse in judgement . " 
The investigation by TDLR involves the services provided by the nail technician and not the mayor , said Mange . 
Failure to comply with the governor 's executive order carries criminal penalties and could result in jail time , fines of up to $ 1,000 and additional administrative fines for the cosmetologist . 
Texas remains under a stay at home order that expires on April 30 .
