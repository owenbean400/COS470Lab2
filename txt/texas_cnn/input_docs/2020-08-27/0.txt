The US is being hammered by twin disasters today . 
The coronavirus outbreak is complicating efforts to evacuate people as Hurricane Laura barrels into the Gulf Coast . 
More than 1.5 million Texas and Louisiana residents were under evacuation orders after the National Hurricane Center warned of " unsurvivable " storm surges of 20 feet or higher . 
Laura , which made landfall as a Category 4 storm before being downgraded to a Category 2 as it made its way inland , could overwhelm coasts and lead to surges reaching some 30 miles inland . 
Evacuations have been hampered by Covid 19 safety protocols . 
Social distancing measures meant extra buses were needed to transport people out , and Louisiana residents were taken to hotels instead of shelters in an effort to keep numbers down , Theresa Waldrop writes .
