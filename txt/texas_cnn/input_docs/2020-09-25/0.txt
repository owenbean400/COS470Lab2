An influential coronavirus model has updated its projection to 371,509 deaths by Jan . 1 -- a drop of about 7,000 deaths from projections about a week ago . 
The model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington ’s School of Medicine is also predicting 3,000 coronavirus deaths a day by the end of the year . 
The forecast is projecting 2.5 million global deaths by Jan . 1 , but that number drops to 1.8 million if 95 % of the world ’s population wore masks , researchers said . 
When factoring in mask usage by 95 % of the US population , the number of cumulative deaths drop to 275,000 by Jan . 1 , saving nearly 100,000 lives between September and late December , according to the model . 
However , national mask use is closer to 48 % , researchers said , making it doubtful the US will be able to significantly drop the death toll . 
Twelve states are now seeing mask usage rates above 50 % -- California , Washington , Colorado , Texas , Mississippi , Florida , North Carolina , Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , IHME said .
