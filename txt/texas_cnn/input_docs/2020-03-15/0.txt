The city of Austin , Texas , is banning gatherings of 250 people or more beginning at 2 a.m . Sunday until at least May 1 , according to a news release from the city . 
Mayor Steve Adler 's order defines community gatherings as " any indoor or outdoor event that is likely to bring together 250 or more people at the same time in a single room or other confined or enclosed space , such as an auditorium , theatre , stadium arena or event center , meeting hall , conference center , large cafeteria , restaurant , nightclub/bar , or any other confined indoor or confined outdoor space . " 
Weddings , religious gatherings , parties , funerals , sporting events , social events , conferences and other large gatherings are just some examples of events that could potentially be included in the ban , the release said . 
" The prohibition does not generally include office space or residential buildings , transit including airports , bus stations or terminals , grocery stores , shopping malls , or hospitals and medical offices and facilities , " the release said , with the reason being that people in these areas tend to not be within an arm 's reach of each other for an extended period of time . 
The new order will be enforced by peace officers , City of Austin Code Department inspectors and the Office of the Austin Fire Marshall beginning at 7 a.m . Monday , the release says .
