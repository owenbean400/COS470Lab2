Colin Bado is a history teacher at Mc Kinney Boyd High School in Mc Kinney , Texas . 
He has been travelling through Europe with a group of 31 students and teachers and is now scrambling to he get his students back to the United States . 
The students , aged between 16 and 18 , have travelled to Normandy , Paris , Munich , Windsor and London on a field trip to learn about World War II . " We found out about the ban while we were in Paris and have been making the best of the situation since that point , " Bado told CNN . 
" We were originally scheduled to fly to Houston this morning , but that was quickly shut down due to the lack of a Covid 19 screening process [ at Houston airport ] , " he said . 
Bado said the school group is now having to split up and fly to Chicago -- then make their way back to Texas . 
Half of his students are on a flight that departed this morning , while the other half will fly from London Heathrow to Chicago O 'hare later this afternoon . 
" We ’ve hit a lot of road blocks , but finally managed to get flights out today , " Bado said . 
" Landing in O ’hare could be interesting , but I ’m reluctant to tell my students of my concerns , " he said , saying the situation been changing " almost an hour by hour change . "
