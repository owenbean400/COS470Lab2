At least 12 states have by now paused or rolled back plans to reopen , hoping the move will slow further spread of the virus . 
In the past week , officials and state leaders have made repeated pleas to Americans to stay away from crowded spaces , keep their distance and try to stay at home as much as possible . 
Washington state Gov . 
Jay Inslee announced the counties that were preparing to enter into the fourth phase of reopening — with essentially no restrictions — will not do so just yet . 
" We all want to get back to doing all the things we love in Washington during the summer , and fully open our economy , but we are not there yet , " the governor said in a statement . 
" This is an evolving situation and we will continue to make decisions based on the data . " 
In Texas and Florida — both of which have raised alarm among experts with a rapid rise in cases — bars were ordered closed for a second time after officials suggested they were a driving force behind cases of coronavirus . 
In a similar move , California Gov . 
Gavin Newsom on Sunday ordered bars closed in seven counties : Los Angeles , Fresno , Imperial , Kern , Kings , San Joaquin and Tulare . 
He recommended closing them in eight other counties , including Contra Costa , Riverside , Sacramento , San Bernardino , Santa Barbara , Santa Clara , Stanislaus and Ventura . 
At least 31 states are now seeing an increase in new cases compared to the previous week , according to data from John Hopkins University .
