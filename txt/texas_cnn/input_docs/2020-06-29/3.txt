The US government ’s last scheduled shipments of the Covid 19 drug remdesivir will be distributed today , according to the Department of Health and Human Services . 
It ’s unclear how the drug will be procured and distributed moving forward . 
What is remdesivir ? 
Remdesivir is not a Covid 19 cure , but it has been shown to speed the recovery of some hospitalized patients . 
Gilead Sciences , the maker of the antiviral drug , donated nearly a million vials to the US government – enough to treat about 121,000 Covid 19 patients . 
But that donation will run out this week . 
On its website , Gilead says its goal is to produce a total of more than 2 million treatment courses by December 2020 . 
Each treatment course requires either six or 11 doses . 
CNN has reached out to HHS for comment about whether the figure on its website is accurate . 
According to HHS data , some coronavirus hot spots will see relatively large shipments this week , with Arizona receiving enough remdesivir to treat approximately 1,800 patients . 
Florida will receive about the same amount , and Texas ’ allocation will be enough for about 2,300 patients . 
State health departments , not the federal government , decide which hospitals get the drug . 
What happens next ? 
It ’s unclear what will happen now that the government ’s entire donated supply of remdesivir has been allocated . 
Under the terms of remdesivir ’s emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration , the drug ’s distribution is controlled by the government . 
The government could procure the drug directly , or it could be sold through regular channels like other drugs . 
Gilead , for its part , has not yet said how much it plans to charge for remdesivir . 
CNN has reached out to both Gilead and HHS for comment .
