Several shipments of Moderna Covid 19 vaccines were delayed before the Christmas holiday due to " temperature excursions , " meaning they had been refrigerated inappropriately while in transit , according to the Texas Hospital Association . 
Leadership reported the issue immediately , Carrie Williams of the Texas Hospital Association said . 
The federal government shipped replacement vaccines . 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Moderna vaccine should arrive onsite frozen between - 25°C ( - 13°F ) and - 15°C ( 5°F ) and stored at the same temperatures . 
Once vaccines are thawed , they must be kept between 2°C ( 36°F ) and 8°C ( 46°F ) and only for up to 30 days . 
The CDC also provides strict and specific handling guidance for Moderna vaccines . 
CNN is still learning about the incident from the CDC , the Texas state health authorities and the shipping company .
