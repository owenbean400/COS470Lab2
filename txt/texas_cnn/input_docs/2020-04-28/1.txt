Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the state will begin to reopen Friday , but a Texas judge hopes residents will not take him up on it . 
" Just because something can be open does not mean it should be open , " Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told CNN 's Erin Burnett on " Burnett Outfront . " 
" And just because something is open does not mean you should go there . " 
Abbott issued an executive order Monday allowing businesses like retail stores , malls , restaurants and theaters to reopen Friday with occupancy limited to 25 % . 
The order supersedes local orders . 
But Jenkins said the best way to open the state 's economy was to keep residents safe -- and that the order went against safest practices advised by scientist and experts . 
" What we know is that when you look at other science based plans , movie theaters are not one of the first things that open , " Jenkins said . 
" And so , I think it 's going to be incumbent on the residents here to use good , smart decision making . " 
Though Jenkins and local politicians cannot override Abbott 's order , the judge said he will look for ways to institute rules to keep residents and employees safe within the reopening .
