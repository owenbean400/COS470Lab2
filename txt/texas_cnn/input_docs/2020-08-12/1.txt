Judge Lina Hidalgo provided new details today on a reopening roadmap for all the school districts in Harris County , Texas . 
The first part of the reopening roadmap is the county ’s threat level system while the second includes a review and approval of plans by Harris County Public Health . 
Hidalgo said that tying the county ’s threat level system to the reopening of the county ’s schools " takes out the politics and focuses on the data . " 
The county is currently under the red threat level , and Hidalgo said that the recommendation is that no in person instruction should take place right now . 
Hidalgo said that while it ’s not required for a school district to have the endorsement of the Public Health Department under current state law , she highly recommends following the guidelines for the safety of the children and those who work at the schools . 
Some context : Previously , Hidalgo issued an order requiring all public and non religious private schools in the county to remain closed to in person instruction until at least Sept . 8 . 
" I understand the desperate desire to go back to school right now , " Hidalgo said . 
" I know that in person learning is vital for the educational development for the social well being of children and young adults . " 
She said the metrics will be met much sooner if people stay at home and follow the guidance issued by the public health authorities .
