The Texas Department of State Health Services changed the method in which Covid 19 deaths are reported Monday . 
Covid 19 fatalities are now being identified through the cause of death on death certificates . 
" This method allows fatalities to be counted faster with more comprehensive demographic data . 
Using death certificates also ensures consistent reporting across the state and enables DSHS to display fatalities by date of death , providing the public with more information about when deaths occurred , " the public health agency said Monday . 
The death toll Monday stands at 5,713 fatalities . 
Compared to the 5,038 fatalities reported Sunday , the state accrued 675 Covid 19 related deaths on Monday ; however , only 44 of these deaths are newly reported , according to the public health agency . 
Note : These numbers were released by the Texas Department of State Health Services , and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN â€™s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University .
