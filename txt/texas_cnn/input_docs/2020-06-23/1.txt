As Texas sees its highest numbers of positive tests and hospitalizations , Gov . 
Greg Abbott advised residents of the state to stay at home . 
" Because the spread is so rapid right now , there â€™s never a reason for you to leave your home , unless you do need to go out , " Abbott added . 
New restrictions could be put into place if the virus spread continues at its current rate , Abbott said , but the state is already encouraging and reinforcing the ideas of mask wearing , hand sanitization and social distancing . 
There is increased enforcement in areas , such as bars , that are seeing overcrowding , he said . 
He added that his first obligation is that people in the state understand the magnitude of Covid 19 .
