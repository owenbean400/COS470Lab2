At least 13 states have reported more than 100,000 coronavirus infections and four of them — California , Florida , Texas and New York — have recorded more than 400,000 . 
California , with more than 516,000 positive cases , has reported the most infections in the nation , but is beginning the week on a positive note . 
The state reported a seven day average of cases of about 7,764 Monday , which is down about 21 % from the previous week , Gov . 
Gavin Newsom said . 
In Los Angeles County , officials said they 're cautiously optimistic as data trends seem to be stabilizing and moving slightly downward . 
Los Angeles is seeing a seven day average of about 2,600 cases per day , down from a couple weeks ago when that same average was more than 3,000 cases each day . 
Florida has the second highest number of cases in the country , with more than 491,000 recorded infections . 
Two teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 have also died in the state , according to state data , bringing the total number of minors in Florida who have died in relation to the virus to seven . 
In Texas , Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner , who in July proposed a two week stay at home order to help drive down cases , said Monday the city will be issuing citations and fines to people who are not following the state 's mask mandate . 
The state has reported more than 455,000 infections and more than 8,000 people are hospitalized statewide . 
" When we are encountering people on patrols , out and about , and we are seeing that they do not have their mask on when they are in public and around other people , we will provide the necessary warning , " Turner said . 
" And then a failure to heed to that warning will lead to a citation and a $ 250 fine , " he said .
