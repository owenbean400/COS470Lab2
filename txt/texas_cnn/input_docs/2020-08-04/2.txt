Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott said that local school districts in the state , not local governments , have the flexibility to decide how and when they will open during the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Texas local school officials can base their operating decisions on input from local health authorities , Abbott said . 
In a statement Friday , Abbott said while local health authorities can close schools during the school year if conditions warrant , they " do not have the power to issue preemptive , blanket closures of schools weeks or months in advance of when a school may open its doors to students . " 
Abbott said schools can choose to open remotely with online study , or in classrooms , or a blend of both . 
The remote learning option can continue for eight weeks , after which schools have the option to seek a waiver to continue remote study . 
Speaking before a backdrop of personal protective equipment inside the Texas Division of Emergency Management in San Antonio , Abbott said the state has already provided the necessary protective equipment for schools to open safely , boasting " more than 59 million masks , more than 24 thousand thermometers , " as well 500,000 face shields and 565 gallons of hand sanitizer have been delivered .
