As coronavirus cases continue to increase in Texas , Austin Mayor Steve Adler said that it was failure at the statewide level that has brought Texas to its current coronavirus stage . 
Texas ' mask mandate went into effect on July 3 , weeks after other states issued theirs . 
Many other states still do not have statewide mandates and there are no federal orders to wear masks . 
The mayor said that a mask mandate sends a " clear message " when the message coming out of Washington is " harmful . " 
Mayor Adler added that the city of Austin 's mask mandate " bought some more time " — but it ’s still on the edge . 
" We 've bought some more time , but if anybody 's listening now from Austin , now is not the time to take the foot off the break . 
We are on the edge , " he said . 
" We had 17 more people admitted into our ICUs last night . 
That 's a 10 % increase . 
So we 're still in a rough place . " 
He added that he ’s hearing from other hospitals near Austin , asking about ICU availability , and he ’s expecting the demand to come from all over the state . 
" What happens around the state impacts us , " he said . 
" We have been calculating our need based on our need and now we realize that it 's going to be coming from all over the state . 
This needs a statewide and a [ national ] response . "
