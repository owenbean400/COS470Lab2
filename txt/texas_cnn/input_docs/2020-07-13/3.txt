Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , said the United States did not shut down entirely , and now we are seeing surges in cases in several states across the nation . 
" It is very clear – and we know this from countries throughout the world – that if you physically separate people , to the point of not allowing the virus to transmit … We know that we can do that if we shut down , " Fauci said while speaking during a webinar with the Stanford School of Medicine on Monday . 
" Then , as we started to reopen , we 're seeing the surges that we 're seeing today , as we speak , in California , your own state , in Arizona , in Texas , in Florida , and in several other states , " he explained . 
Fauci said , however , that he is " confident " the US can get a handle on this situation . 
" You do not necessarily need to shut down again , but pull back a bit . 
And then , proceed in a very prudent way , observing the guidelines of going from step to step , " he said .
