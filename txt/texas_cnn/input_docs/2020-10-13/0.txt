Fans attended a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) game on Monday night for the first time since March , when the league shut down spring training due to the pandemic . 
It was previously announced that MLB would make approximately 11,500 tickets available for each game at Globe Life Field in Arlington , Texas , the site for the National League Championship Series ( NLCS ) and the World Series . 
And the fans came on Monday , for the start of the NLCS between the Atlanta Braves and the Los Angeles Dodgers -- making this the first 2020 playoff game with fans in the stands . 
No fans were allowed during the 2020 regular season . 
They were treated to a good game : The teams were tied at 1-1 in the top of the ninth inning when Austin Riley , on a 1-2 pitch , blasted a solo home run 448 feet to give the Braves a 2-1 lead . 
Atlanta would go on to win 5-1 . 
" We have not heard anything other than fake crowd noise , " Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman said to reporters after the game . 
Game 2 of the best of seven series will be Tuesday .
