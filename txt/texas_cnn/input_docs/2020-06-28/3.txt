The Texas Medical Center released a statement Sunday saying that an incomplete slide deck , or presentation page , was posted yesterday to their website . 
This means there was insufficient information on the number of ICU beds amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
This statement comes amid concerns that the Texas Medical Center had stopped publishing updated data on Intensive Care Unit bed availability in the Houston area . 
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told CNN Sunday that he noticed data was down for Friday and Saturday . 
" That information was provided for the last , well over the last month , I would get those numbers every morning . 
So I noticed that I did not get them Friday and Saturday , " Turner said . 
" I 've had some conversations and I think we 're all on the same page . 
And that should be coming back as of tomorrow . " 
Texas Gov . 
Greg Abbott spoke with hospital executives earlier in the week and told them that they need to provide accurate and timely data on Covid 19 as often as possible , an Abbott spokesperson told CNN .
