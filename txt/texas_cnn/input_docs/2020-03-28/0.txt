Sheri Reiter , a speech pathologist , has an elderly father in Houston , Texas , who has been waiting more than a week to get the results of his coronavirus test . 
Reiter shared her story and frustration Friday night during CNN 's town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden . 
Reiter specifically asked the presidential hopeful , " Why is it that some rich and famous can have Covid 19 test and get results in 24 hours ? " 
Biden claims part of the problem is the country has not been " focused on dealing with what needs to be done from the outset . "
