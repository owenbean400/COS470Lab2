The city of Houston , Texas could furlough all of its employees except for police and firefighters , Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a news conference on Tuesday . 
The furloughs are likely to take place to make up for a $ 200 million budget shortfall and would likely start on July 1 , Turner said . 
Turner reiterated that the city is looking at the possibility of utilizing some of those dollars to prevent furlough in some categories .
