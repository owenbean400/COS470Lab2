New York Gov . 
Andrew Cuomo pushed back against comments by President Trump that he could reopen the US economy while keeping an eye on some of the most at risk populations , including seniors . 
" My mother is not expendable . 
And your mother is not expendable . 
And our brothers and sisters are not expendable , " Cuomo said . 
" And we 're not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable . 
And we 're not going to put a dollar figure on human life . " 
Cuomo said saving lives is most important , but there can be an " intelligent " strategy for getting people back to work .
