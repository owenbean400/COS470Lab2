Local Texas officials want Gov . 
Greg Abbott to require face masks but the governor 's office says they have not imposed penalties already available to them , a spokesperson for Abbott tells CNN . 
Nine Texas mayors , including the top officials in Houston , Dallas , Austin and San Antonio , have urged the state 's governor to require face masks to stop Covid 19 from spreading in their cities . 
Wittman seemed to refer to Shelley Luther , a Texas salon owner , who was sent to jail for seven days for violating the state 's stay at home order . 
" No one could be jailed for not wearing a mask under my or the City of Dallas ' orders , " Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said earlier this week . 
" I â€™m simply asking the governor to lead on the masking requirement the medical experts say is the single most important thing we can do right now . " 
" All of us have a collective responsibility to educate the public that wearing a mask is the best thing to do . 
Putting people in jail , however , is the wrong approach for this thing and that 's exactly what I believe the Dallas County judge wants to do , " Abbott said in during a briefing Tuesday . 
Local officials " have the ability to impose fines , not for face masks , but for other strategies " like certain gatherings , Abbott said . 
Texas currently has 93,044 Covid 19 cases and 2,044 coronavirus related deaths , according to John Hopkins University . 
It is among the at least 21 states that are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next .
