The mayor of Houston , Texas , Sylvester Turner , said Wednesday that he is considering implementing a face mask order . 
The Houston Health Department is reporting at least 10,507 positive cases of coronavirus and approximately 169 deaths since the pandemic began , Turner said . 
The mayor said the Greater Houston partnership , which is a coalition of Houston area business owners , supports the idea of a mask order that would require employees and customers to wear face masks . 
Turner said he spoke briefly to Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo today about the possibility of an order , but said he does not anticipate any moves to happen immediately . 
He added that even if a face mask order was issued , he would not require jail time for violators . 
" We want people to be able to go back to school for example in the fall and to engage in other activities and functions during the fall . 
But in order for that to happen , how we handle the summer is going to be critically important , " he said . 
Dr . David Persse with the Houston Health Department said he is concerned with the recent uptick in emergency room visits in Houston . 
Both Dr . Persse and Turner believe the recent uptick is due to younger people going to clubs and restaurants .
