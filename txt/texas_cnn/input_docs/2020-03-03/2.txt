Scientists are working on a vaccine , but do not expect it anytime soon . 
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) is trying to develop one but says it will take at least a few months before clinical trials start and more than a year until a vaccine could become available . 
Separately , scientists in Texas , New York and China are also trying to create a vaccine , said Dr . Peter Hotez , a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . 
But the challenge is daunting , Hotez said . 
" The lesson we 've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats , " he said .
