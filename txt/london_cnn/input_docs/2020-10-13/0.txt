The Mayor of London said it was " inevitable " the UK ’s capital would meet the threshold for tougher coronavirus restrictions in the coming days . 
Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday , Sadiq Khan said : Like most of England , London is currently on " medium " alert – the lowest level of the government 's new three tier system announced Monday – meaning bars and restaurants are still open until 10 p.m . and up to six people from different households can meet indoors . 
The mayor is calling for the capital to be moved into the second tier " high " alert level , which would ban people from socializing with other households indoors . 
He added it should cover the whole city because people frequently travel between boroughs to work and study . 
The Liverpool City Region is currently the only part of England in the third tier and is on " very high " alert , with bars and pubs closed . 
This area is situated in the northwest of the country , which has the highest infection rate of 1,741 per 100,000 people . 
The current rate of infection in London is 695 per 100,000 people , according to government data . 
The UK ’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer on Monday voiced " great concern " that the virus was spreading to southern parts of the country .
