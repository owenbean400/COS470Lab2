There are currently almost 3,000 lorries stranded in Kent , England , a press officer for Kent County Council told CNN on Tuesday afternoon . 
They are stranded because France closed its border with Britain on Sunday following the emergence of a new Covid 19 variant discovered in the UK . 
There are 632 lorries on the M20 motorway – a key gateway to the continent for freight trucks traveling in and out of the UK – and 2,188 lorries in the Manston Airport carpark , the press officer said . 
On Monday , the UK enacted " Operation Brock " in a bid to keep traffic moving on the M20 during periods of cross Channel disruption . 
The motorway barrier system was designed to deal with potential traffic disruption at the end of the Brexit transition period . 
Lorries arriving in Kent en route to the port of Dover or the Eurotunnel are being diverted to Manston Airport to park . 
The operation involves using a contraflow road layout on the M20 London bound carriageway between junctions 9 and 8 ( from Ashford to Maidstone ) and directing lorries heading for mainland Europe onto the coastbound carriageway , where they can be queued if necessary . 
Hauliers have been advised to avoid traveling to Kent as disruption could last for several days .
