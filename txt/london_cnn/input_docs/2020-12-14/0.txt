London Mayor Sadiq Khan has criticized the UK government â€™s current Covid 19 restrictions and asked for tighter measures , such as school closures . 
" With significant outbreaks among 10 to 19 year olds , the Government must consider asking schools and colleges to close early and re open later in January , " Khan said . 
In London , 17 local authorities have registered a 7 day case rate higher than 200 cases per 100,000 people . 
Khan told the government it should consider moving London from Tier 2 to Tier 3 of restriction levels , putting the city on " very high alert . " 
This would also allow authorities to introduce more restrictions . 
On Sunday , local authorities in the London borough of Greenwich announced the closure of all its schools from Monday until the end of the term . 
That decision challenges the central government 's policy to keep schools open . 
Sharma said 99 % of schools across the UK have remained open since the beginning of the school year , and the government will talk to local authorities to discuss changes in restrictions " on a case by case basis . "
