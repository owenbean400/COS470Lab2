However the figure is more likely 2-3 % in the UK as a whole .

At least 1,228 of those hospitalized have died .

Junior Health Minister Helen Whately told BBC Radio that she is aware of work being undertaken to develop the test , but would not confirm when it would be available . 
She also defended the UK ’s record on testing for coronavirus , while conceding there are a " handful " of countries that are doing more testing .
