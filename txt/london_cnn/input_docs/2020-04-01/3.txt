Jack , who worked primarily as a dialect coach to stars including Chris Hemsworth , died at St . Peter ’s Hospital , Chertsey , just outside London , his agent Jill Mc Cullough said . 
Jack ’s wife was unable to be with him , as she is stuck in quarantine in Australia . 
Mc Cullough added . 
" She was unable to see or talk to him at the end of his life and there is a chance a funeral may not be held , " she said . 
" He was still working full pelt , currently coaching on the new ' Batman , ' " the statement reads . 
" Dialect coaching is not just about being good at accents -- you need to make your actors feel safe and confident -- and Andrew ’s actors adored him . "
