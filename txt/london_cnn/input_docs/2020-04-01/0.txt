The UK will open the doors this week on what could soon be the biggest intensive care unit in the country -- and it was built in about a week . 
As the number of Covid 19 cases in the UK began to rise , the National Health Service ( NHS ) realized it might be short many thousands of ICU beds . 
It hopes the solution is at a massive convention space in London ’s East End . 
The Ex Cel Center is more accustomed to showcasing the latest ventilator technology than actually using it . 
The coronavirus field hospital will be called NHS Nightingale , after the pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale . 
She is the operational guru responsible for transforming empty halls into a functioning hospital . 
When fully running , it will have 4,000 beds . 
At the moment , just a few dozen that CNN saw were ready . 
" Obviously we do not want to use those beds , " Forrest says . 
It ’s staff , rather than equipment , that medical director Dr . Alan Mc Glennan says he ’s most nervous about running out of . 
" Critical care nurses are in very short supply , " he said . 
It wo not be a hospital in a traditional sense . 
There will be no front door , no waiting rooms . 
" We will be receiving patients from ICUs across London , " Forrest says . 
" So not all types of patients -- just patients who are sedated and ventilated , and need to be cared for in an ICU . " 
Britain has more than 25,400 coronavirus cases , with nearly 1,800 deaths , according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University .
