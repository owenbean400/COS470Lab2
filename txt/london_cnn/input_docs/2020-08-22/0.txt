British people on summer holidays abroad are rushing home as government rules on who must quarantine on their return have again changed . 
The UK on Thursday removed Croatia , Austria , and Trinidad and Tobago from its list of safe travel corridors as cases in those countries rise , obliging those returning from those countries to quarantine for 14 days . 
The new restrictions were scheduled to take effect after 4 a.m . on Saturday , triggering masses of holidaymakers to cut short their vacations and get on earlier , often more expensive , flights home . 
Thomas Maguire , 63 , a sales manager from Northern Ireland was among those on the last planes to land at London 's Heathrow Airport before the quarantine rules went into effect . 
He was due to fly back Sunday but returned early on Friday evening . 
He told the UK 's PA Media the rule changes were a " complete shambles , " saying he had spent almost £ 400 ( $ 523 ) to get on an early flight . 
" Why they decided to do it the way they have done it , it ’s not in support of any scientific evidence ... that I ’m safer today than I would be tomorrow , " he said . 
The UK on Thursday also added Portugal to its list of safe travel corridor countries . 
The UK government has advised British residents to only travel if they are happy to be forced to quarantine on their return . 
" As with all air bridge countries , please be aware that things can change quickly . 
Only travel if you are content to unexpectedly 14 day quarantine if required ( I speak from experience ! ) , " UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps said in a Tweet on Thursday .
