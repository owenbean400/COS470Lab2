Researchers at Imperial College London will begin human trials of a UK government funded Covid 19 vaccine this week , the UK Department for Business , Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement . 
Beginning this week , 300 healthy human participants between the ages of 18 and 70 will receive two doses of the vaccine . 
The vaccine was already shown to be safe and effective in animal trials and " has undergone rigorous pre clinical safety tests , " according to the government statement . 
The vaccine involves a " new approach " that uses synthetic strands of genetic code , called RNA , which are based on the virus ' genetic material . 
When injected , the vaccine prompts a person 's muscle cells to produce virus proteins . 
" The trials will be the first test of a new self amplifying RNA technology , which has the potential to revolutionise vaccine development and enable scientists to respond more quickly to emerging diseases , " the statement said . 
The UK government has contributed $ 51.4 million ( 41 million pounds ) towards the Imperial College London vaccine development , and another $ 6.3 million ( 5 million pounds ) has been donated by members of the public . 
Oxford University is also working on a vaccine in partnership with UK based global biopharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca . 
In May , Oxford University announced that their vaccine research moved to the second phase of human trials , which involves 10,260 participants , including a small number of older adults and children .
