Heathrow Airport CEO John Holland Kaye said the UK government must work with the international community to establish a common standard for how to avoid measures , such as quarantine , that will " completely kill the travel sector " . 
He noted that there is no commonly , internationally established health screening other than temperature checks . 
What the airport is doing now : Heathrow Airport is testing technologies around a large scale screening system to reduce the risk of Covid 19 transmission while traveling . 
Trials will assess for medical effectiveness , passenger response as well as suitability to the airport environment . 
Technologies under review will include UV sanitation , facial recognition thermal screening technology and contactless security procedures . 
Heathrow Airport will share data from trials with government and industry to jumpstart the creation of a Common International Standard for health screening . 
Why this matters : If this technology proves successful , it will give us a glimpse of what the future of travel will look like when the the movement restrictions around the world are lifted .
