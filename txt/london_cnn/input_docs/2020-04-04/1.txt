What happens when a once rejected dystopian novel turns into reality ? 
Ask Scottish author Peter May . 
The screenwriter turned novelist wrote a book titled " Lockdown " in 2005 about a global pandemic . 
Fifteen years later , that 's our reality due to coronavirus , which has so far infected more than 1 million people globally . 
The book , which was rejected by publishers at the time for being too unrealistic , was finally published on Thursday . 
The story , and the revival : The thriller is set in London , the epicenter of a global pandemic that forces officials to institute a lockdown . 
Years ago , publishers dismissed the novel as " extremely unrealistic and unreasonable , " May said . 
So he put the book on the back burner and eventually forgot he even wrote it . 
That was until a fan on Twitter asked him to write a book set against the backdrop of the coronavirus . 
" Lockdown , " available only on Amazon UK , is being sold in Kindle format and will be available as a paperback and audiobook on April 30 .
