London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that the capital 's public spaces will only remain open if the government 's stay at home order is adhered to . 
Some context : The mayor 's warning follows an earlier call by the British government for members of the public to stay at home over the weekend , amid concerns that the sunny weather could see an uptick in the number of people gathering outside . 
" If you go out this weekend , you might catch more than the sun , " Downing Street said in a tweet Saturday . 
The UK National Police Chiefs Council ( NPCC ) has also confirmed that patrols will be taking place over the weekend to encourage people to follow the rules . 
" Please continue to stay at home and only travel for essentials . 
We know the weather is going to be nice , but the sooner we can beat Covid 19 , the sooner we can all go back to enjoying the great outdoors , " the NPCC said .
