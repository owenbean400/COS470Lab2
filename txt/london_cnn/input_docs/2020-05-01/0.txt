London likely wo not be able to return to pre pandemic life , even after the immediate threat passes , warned Mayor Sadiq Khan in an opinion piece published in the Evening Standard newspaper . 
" While non essential shops will be able to reopen after introducing social distancing measures , it is difficult to see how this can safely be extended to bars , restaurants or social spaces in a practicable way soon . " 
He also suggested there will be new rules for people traveling on public transport , like wearing face coverings . 
To avoid rush hour and congestion , schools and workplaces will stagger their start times , and more people will have to walk or cycle to their destinations , he said .
