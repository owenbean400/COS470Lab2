World Health Organization officials are investigating a rare inflammatory condition called Kawasaki disease that has emerged as a possible complication of coronavirus infection in young children , officials in Europe said during a media briefing on Thursday . 
While there have been rare reports of cases in London and other parts of Europe , " only half of these children tested positive for coronavirus , " Adam Finn , professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol and chairman of the European Technical Advisory Group of Experts advising WHO Europe , said during the briefing . 
" This may be a late complication of the infection , " Finn said , " But all of this is speculation at this point . 
The size and exact nature of this problem is only just beginning to emerge . " 
Research into this possible association now continues , Dr . Dorit Nitzan , health emergencies coordinator for WHO 's European Region , said during the briefing . 
" We are looking together with our clinical network and the pediatricians in the European region and in the Americas for the possible connection or correlation or some kind of association between that type of inflammatory syndrome and Covid 19 , " Nitzan said on Thursday . 
" We will come out with the results and new news as soon as we have them done . "
