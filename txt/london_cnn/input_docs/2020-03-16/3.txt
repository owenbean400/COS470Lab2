All passengers were taken off a flight scheduled to depart from the Indian state of Kerala for Dubai on Sunday morning after officials learnt that a UK national who had tested positive for the coronavirus was on board , an Emirates spokesperson said . 
The UK citizen had been touring Munnar , a hill station in the southern Indian state , and was under surveillance after testing positive for the coronavirus , the spokesperson said . 
He and his wife were a part of a group of 19 British tourists who were also among the 290 passengers removed from the flight at Cochin International Airport in Kochi . 
" Fifteen minutes prior to departure we learnt that a UK national who had tested positive for coronavirus was onboard the flight , " said the Emirates spokesperson . 
The 19 tourists and one Indian national were isolated at the airport , and the remaining 270 passengers took the flight to Dubai after a three hour delay . 
" The husband and wife have been sent to a local hospital for quarantine and further tests while the remaining group of tourists has been quarantined at a makeshift facility at a hotel near the airport , " said P.S . Jayan , a spokesperson for Cochin International Airport . 
The Indian national was let go as he was not under suspicion of contracting the virus , Jayan added . 
An American couple who had flown from London to Kochi earlier this month were apprehended at the same airport on Friday while trying to fly to Doha , after an alert was issued by a hospital . 
They had visited the hospital earlier that day because the woman was suffering from diarrhoea . 
After examination , staff asked that they be tested for coronavirus and quarantined until the results came back . 
The couple left the hospital without taking the test . 
They are currently under quarantine in hospital .
