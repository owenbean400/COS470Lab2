British doctor Katie Sanderson says there are some " very , very significant gaps " in the provision of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for treating coronavirus patients . 
Referencing a Doctors ' Association UK survey with more than 1,100 responses in 250 settings , Sanderson told BBC radio that 38 % of doctors had no eye protection , 38 % who need FFP3 masks do not have access to them and 47 % do not have access to long sleeve gowns . 
Sanderson , who works as a junior doctor in north London , also said the government should provide reassurance to families of medical workers that they wo not face financial ruin if the health worker dies at work . 
" All of us are more or less worried about dying as a result of being infected with coronavirus at work , " Sanderson said , adding that for migrant families , there is the extra stress of their visa situation .
