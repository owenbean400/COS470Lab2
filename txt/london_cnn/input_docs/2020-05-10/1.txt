Police in London have been struggling to keep people from breaking lockdown rules over the long weekend , as warm weather has tempted crowds of people outdoors . 
Police in the eastern borough of Hackney posted a photo on Twitter of people drinking beer and wine , and eating pizza at a park , saying " sadly we ’re fighting a losing battle in the parks today . " 
Images from Greenwich Park in the city 's southeast also showed police patrolling while asking people having picnics and drinking in the sun to leave . 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled on Sunday evening to present a plan for lifting the nation 's lockdown . 
He said earlier in the week that he had hoped some restrictions could be eased on Monday . 
But without ministers giving details on the record about which measures may be loosened , British media has speculated on what new freedoms they may have next week . 
Meanwhile , the country ’s Housing Minister Robert Jenrick spoke Sunday of a new five tier alert system to rank the virus ' threat level . 
Johnson is expected to announce the system when he unveils a plan this evening to ease the nation out of lockdown . 
The UK is likely on level four of the alert system , Jenrick told Sky News . 
UK reports suggested the alert system would only initially apply to England and that the government would work with Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland to establish similar systems . 
" At the moment , we believe the country is at four on a scale of five , with five being the most concerning , " Jenrick told Sky News . 
" Our aspiration is to bring that down as swiftly as possible to three . 
" This will be a cautious approach . "
