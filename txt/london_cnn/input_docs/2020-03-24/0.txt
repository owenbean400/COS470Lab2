They " enable researchers to separate the effects of genes from environmental factors such as diet , lifestyle , previous illnesses and infections , and the microbes within the gut ( microbiome ) " the school said in a news release . 
The twins will record information about their health on a daily basis , including temperature , tiredness and symptoms such as coughing , breathing problems or headaches .
