Members of the British royal family and political figures , including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson , laid wreaths at the war memorial in central London on Sunday as part of Remembrance Sunday commemorations , but the event was pared back this year due to Covid 19 restrictions . 
The socially distanced wreath laying ceremony was preceded by a two minute silence and was observed by the Queen watching overhead from the balcony of the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office building . 
Both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall observed the ceremony from separate balconies above . 
This year members of the public were asked to watch the celebrations from home , and the London ceremony was restricted to invited guests only . 
UK Minister for Defence Ben Wallace said the government had left the responsibility for local ceremonies to local councils but encouraged members of the public to show their respect in alternative ways this year . 
Wallace said it was important to " get the balance right " for this year â€™s commemorations as " some of our veterans are very elderly and indeed the very people we need to protect against this awful infection . " 
The Royal British Legion echoed this call to members of the public telling them on Twitter to " join the nation in Remembrance and observe the two minute silence from your doorstep . " 
The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge were among the first to pay their respects to the lost soldiers , laying crimson poppy wreaths at the Cenotaph shortly after 11 a.m . local time ( 6 a.m . ET ) . 
They were followed by Johnson , Opposition Leader Keir Starmer , Home Secretary Priti Patel , Minister for Defence Ben Wallace , and representatives from Commonwealth countries . 
Remembrance Sunday has been observed in the UK and Commonwealth countries since the end of World War I in 1918 .
