Easyjet will close its bases at London Stansted , London Southend and Newcastle starting August 31 , said the group on Monday , putting hundreds of jobs at risk . 
It cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and related travel restrictions compounded by quarantine measures in the UK . 
These rules have " created uncertainty for customers and an impact on demand for travel , " said Easyjet in a statement . 
The three bases employ 670 people , and Easyjet says it has reached an agreement on voluntary redundancy with staff . 
London Stansted and Newcastle will remain part of its network , and some domestic and international flights will continue to operate . 
The airline said it will inform customers of available refunds and transfer options in the coming days .
