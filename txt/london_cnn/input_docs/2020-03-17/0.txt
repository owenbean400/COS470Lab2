When Declan Chan , a stylist based in Hong Kong , flew home from London this week , he was given a wristband to wear upon arrival . 
It was an electronic band , and would track his movements while he stayed home for 14 days under mandatory quarantine , officials explained . 
It 's the latest preventative measure introduced in the city , which has seen a rise in imported coronavirus cases from overseas in the past two weeks , after a period of slowing infections . 
The government announced new travel restrictions today , requiring all arriving travelers from foreign countries to undergo the 14 day quarantine . 
The wristbands , and an accompanying smartphone app , will alert officials if travelers violate the quarantine . 
Chan said he was instructed to download the smartphone app , and to walk around his apartment once he arrived home , so that it could map his premises .
