London is weeks ahead of the rest of the UK in the coronavirus pandemic , and must now move into the next phase of its response , Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a video posted to Twitter . 
" The Prime Minister ( Boris Johnson ) has said that London is now a few weeks ahead of the rest of the country because of our global connectivity and size , " said Khan , urging residents to follow the official advice . 
If residents had family members showing symptoms , the entire household should self quarantine and not go outside for 14 days , he said . 
Vulnerable residents like the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions should limit their contact with others . 
London is the biggest city in Western Europe , with close to 9 million inhabitants . 
There have been 1,547 coronavirus cases and 55 deaths in the UK , according to the World Health Organization . 
The new measures are being implemented because the country is " now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve " in cases and " without drastic action cases could double every five to six days , " Johnson has warned .
