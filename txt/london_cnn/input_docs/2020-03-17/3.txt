Healthy people over the age of 70 should avoid crowded places and social gatherings -- even family Sunday lunches -- the UK ’s chief scientific adviser said Tuesday as he clarified some of the government advice given to the British public the day before . 
Sir Patrick Vallance told the House of Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee that everyone over 70 -- not just those with underlying health conditions -- should drastically change their daily routines . 
" Avoid crowded spaces , avoid gatherings , do not got to the club where you normally go to , reduce travel , try to avoid unnecessary travel , do not [ do ] your usual things in terms of going to the shops unless you absolutely have to , " Vallance said . 
Asked by the committee ’s chairman , and former health secretary , Jeremy Hunt , whether people that age should avoid Sunday lunch with their grandchildren , Vallance said they should . 
Giving evidence later , the chief executive of the National Health Service in England , Sir Stewart Stevens , said elective ( non urgent ) operations would be suspended until April 15 , or earlier , if hospitals could manage it , in order to free up capacity to deal with the expected spike in coronavirus cases . 
Asked whether the country would have enough ventilators to treat the expected number of cases in the new set of modelling published by scientists at Imperial College London yesterday , Stevens demurred , saying that it would be necessary to wait and see what the real life effects of the social distancing advice given by the UK government would be .
