More research shows that coronavirus can cause a range of neurological problems , from dementia to psychosis . 
Some patients with severe cases of the disease have presented with several neurological conditions , according to a study of UK patients published in The Lancet Psychiatry Thursday . 
These included newly diagnosed altered mental states in people under age 60 , including a dementia like cognitive syndrome , psychosis , inflammation and mood disorders like depression or anxiety . 
And although strokes were markedly more common among patients above 60 , they were also seen across all age groups included in the study . 
How it works : Jennifer Loftis , a psychiatry professor at Oregon Health & Science who was not involved with the study , said inflammatory molecules , called cytokines , are found throughout the body , including the central nervous system . 
When these molecules proliferate , such as during a Covid 19 infection , elevations could also be in the brain â€” contributing to neuropsychiatric impairments like depression and impacting how cells talk to each other . 
Still , the study published Thursday cannot discount the possibility that young patients had undiagnosed , pre existing psychiatric conditions . 
As for younger Covid 19 patients in the study who have had a stroke , Michael said the possible causes include artery inflammation and changes in clotting proteins . 
This may also cause strokes for older patients , in addition to conventional risk factors for that population . 
" We ca not tell the relative frequencies of these things , but it 's really what doctors are seeing and reporting , " Timothy Nicholson , one of the study 's co authors and a clinical lecturer at King 's College in London , said in a statement . 
" It 's really a sort of early warning system of what we might expect , " he added .
