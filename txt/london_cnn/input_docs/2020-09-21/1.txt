The UK has " in a bad sense , recently turned a corner " in the coronavirus pandemic , UK chief medical adviser Chris Whitty said Monday , at a special briefing alongside chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance . 
Coronavirus cases are on the increase across the UK , and Vallance and Whitty -- the country 's leading medical experts -- warn that , as the weather turns colder , the situation is likely to worsen . 
Vallance said infections were increasing across all age groups , with the highest rise among 20 - to 29 year olds . 
" There is the potential for this to move very fast , " Vallance told reporters at the news conference in Downing Street . 
Whitty said the virus was likely to be a serious concern for the next six months , during the annual winter flu season . 
" The seasons are against us , " Whitty said . 
" We should see this as a six month problem that we have to deal with ... we have to realize that we have to take this collectively very seriously . " 
Coronavirus is more virulent than the flu , he said . 
" This is not someone else 's problem ; this is all of our problem , " Whitty said . 
" If this carries on unabated ... the number of deaths directly from Covid will continue to rise , potentially on an exponential curve , " he added . 
Evidence suggests that fewer than 8 % of people overall have developed antibodies to the virus -- though that number may be higher in cities , and up to 17 % in London , Vallance said . 
" The vast majority of us are not protected in any way and are susceptible to this disease , " he said , repeating for emphasis : " The vast majority of the population remains susceptible . "
