Loss of smell and taste are a strong sign that someone is infected with Covid 19 , according to new research published Thursday . 
People who lose either smell or taste should consider self isolating , even if they have no other symptoms , researchers in Britain said . 
How the study was conducted : The team studied 590 volunteers who experienced a new loss of smell or taste . 
They tested 567 of them for coronavirus . 
Of the 567 , 77.6 % tested positive for SARS Co V 2 antibodies . 
In total , 80.4 % of participants reporting smell loss and 77.8 % of those reporting taste loss had a positive test result , the team reported in the journal PLo S Medicine . 
Nearly 40 % of those who tested positive for antibodies had neither a fever nor a cough . 
Batterham and her colleagues also found that participants with a loss of smell alone were nearly three times more likely than patients with just a loss of taste to have Covid 19 antibodies , and participants with a combined loss of smell and taste were four times more likely to have antibodies . 
" These findings suggest that a loss of smell is a highly specific symptom of Covid 19 , in contrast to a loss of taste , despite their comparable frequency , " the researchers wrote . 
The study recruited its volunteers between April 23 and May 14 , during the peak of the Covid 19 outbreak in London . 
It did not include a comparison group of people who did not lose their sense of smell and/or taste .
