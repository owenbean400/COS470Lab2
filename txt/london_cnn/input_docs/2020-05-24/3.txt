One of Boris Johnson ’s Conservative Party lawmakers has called on the Prime Minister ’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings to resign for breaching coronavirus rules . 
" Enough is enough , " Steve Baker wrote in an opinion piece for The Critic website . 
" Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK , the Government , the Prime Minister , our institutions or the Conservative Party . " 
Baker said it is " intolerable " that Johnson ’s government is losing so much political capital at the moment . 
" Time is up . 
It is time for Dom to resign so Boris can govern within the conventions and norms which will see us through . 
" It is time to get competing expert advice , decent software and better decisions , end the lockdown and start a long , hard recovery . " 
A former adviser for Johnson ’s predecessor , Theresa May , has also called on Cummings to resign . 
" I think the second incident … if true , does it . 
I do not think there ’s any way around it , " Tom Swarbrick told Sky News . 
" It ’s very clear he broke the rules anyway and the mitigation that was being offered does not stack up when you ’ve had this second incident . " 
The Guardian and Mirror newspapers are reporting that Cummings made a second trip from London to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown . 
Downing Street said in response to the latest stories : " We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr . Cummings from campaigning newspapers . " 
They follow earlier reports that Cummings made an initial journey to his parents for childcare while sick with Covid 19 symptoms .
