London is at risk of being placed into England 's highest Tier 3 category of restrictions with Covid 19 infection rates " still far too high , " according to a top health official for the capital . 
Professor Kevin Fenton , London regional director for Public Health England , said that case reductions during England 's national lockdown , which ended on Wednesday , had started to slow . 
Fenton said there was a " mixed picture " across London , with the highest cases in the north east of the city , but that " even in those areas that have had the biggest declines , rates are still far too high . " 
He called on residents to " remain vigilant " as the city approaches its first weekend under Tier 2 restrictions since the month long lockdown ended , saying that action in the weeks ahead will make a big difference to the outlook into the New Year . 
His warning came as the Office For National Statistics said that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England decreased in the week from 22-28 November . 
Infection rates decreased in all regions except the North East . 
Around 1 in 105 people tested positive , with around 25,700 new infections per day . 
The UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer/Bion NTech vaccine this week , with the first doses delivered from Belgium on Thursday and shots expected to start in days . 
But the rollout will take time as the vaccine has to be kept in freezing temperatures . 
It is set to be delivered initially to care home workers , health workers and the elderly , with 800,000 doses promised in the coming week .
