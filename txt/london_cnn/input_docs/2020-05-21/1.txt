London Heathrow Airport is implementing thermal screening in one of its arrival terminals in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus . 
The technology under trial " uses camera detection systems capable of monitoring the temperatures of multiple people moving through the airport , " Heathrow â€™s CEO said in a statement . 
Some background : Other international airports have implemented temperature screenings , but they are not currently required to take place in the UK . 
The Spanish Health Ministry made temperature checks in airports mandatory earlier this month . 
Temperature checks in the immigration hall of terminal two is part of a wider range of precautions being adopted to reduce the risk of contracting or transmitting Covid 19 in the future . 
Starting this week , all operational staff at Heathrow have to wear face coverings , and are handing them out to passengers who do not have their own , Heathrow said . 
Observations from the trial will be shared with the UK government , and will also " explore the use of UV sanitation " and " contact free security screening equipment " , John Holland Kaye said . 
He called for international standards of temperature screening in all airports to be implemented and said this trial could provide a global template . 
CNN has previously reported that Heathrow has been conducting temperature checks on passengers where their destination requires it .
