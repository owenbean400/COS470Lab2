The food industry shares the blame for both the obesity pandemic and the severity and consequences of Covid 19 , according to an editorial published Thursday in the BMJ . 
The authors , who are from Queen Mary University in London , highlight the link between obesity and serious illness and death from Covid 19 . 
Studies show that for people who were overweight , the risk of critical illness increased by 44 % and the risk of death increased by 27 % . 
Studies also showed the risk of both critical illness and the risk of death nearly doubled for people who were obese , the authors wrote . 
Obesity also affects immune responses and lessens lung function . 
Because of this , food industries worldwide must change the way that they are reacting to the pandemic and governments must support healthier food habits , the group argued . 
" The food industry has launched campaigns and corporate social responsibility initiatives , often with the thinly veiled tactics using the outbreak as a marketing opportunity , " they wrote . 
During the pandemic , there have also been many issues surrounding food , which include an increase in food poverty and disruptions in the supply chain . 
This may have limited access to fresh food , forcing people to eat more food that is processed or high in salt , sugar and saturated fat . 
With 65 % to 70 % of the United States and United Kingdom populations being overweight or obese , the effects of Covid 19 have made it clear that these changes from the food industry and from governments need to be made , the authors say .
