A new London based coronavirus treatment trial launched this week will test if a formulation of ibuprofen can treat one of the complications of coronavirus : severe acute respiratory distress syndrome . 
The trial is jointly headed by King 's College London , a London research hospital and the pharmaceutical organization , the SEEK Group . 
It aims to reduce Covid 19 related respiratory failure , which in turn may decrease the need for more aggressive intervention such as ventilation , Kings College London said in a statement . 
The drug would be given at a " very specific stage " of the virus to hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected Covid 19 in a randomized study . 
Researchers say the drug differs from standard ibuprofen and is already licensed for use in the UK to treat other conditions . 
If proven successful , the treatment could be " invaluable " because of the low cost and high availability of the drug , the statement adds .
