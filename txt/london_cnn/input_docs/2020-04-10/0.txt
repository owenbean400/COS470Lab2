" I feel tremendously grateful on behalf of the family , Boris ' family , my family , family members all over the place , and of course thankful for the tremendous amount of support ... and thankful for the extraordinary work of the National Health Service . " 
On Thursday evening , Downing Street said the Prime Minister was moved from intensive care back to the ward at St . Thomas ' Hospital in London , where he will be closely monitored . 
But the danger has not fully passed yet , said Stanley Johnson . 
" I do not think you can say this is out of the woods now . 
He has to take time . 
I 'm not onto the details , but I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reigns without a period of adjustment , " he said .
