A team of scientists at Imperial College in London has delivered the first dose of their trial Covid 19 vaccine to a human volunteer , a spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday . 
The dose was administered on Friday to a volunteer , Ryan O ’Hare told CNN . 
The vaccine will initially be trialed in 15 volunteers , he said . 
In the second phase , 300 volunteers will receive the vaccine . 
The so called self amplifying RNA vaccine uses " bits of genetic code , rather than bits of the virus , " to use muscle cells to " produce copies of a protein found on the outside of the virus . " 
According to Imperial College , this " trains the immune system to respond to the coronavirus so the body can easily recognize it as a threat in future . " 
In April , scientists called for volunteers for the human trial of the coronavirus vaccine . 
" We are looking for volunteers to take part in our trial in June — they will be the first volunteers to get the vaccine , " Professor Robin Shattock told BBC radio in April .
