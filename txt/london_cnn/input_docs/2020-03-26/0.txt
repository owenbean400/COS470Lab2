Hospitals in London are experiencing a " continuous tsunami " of coronavirus patients , according to a group that represents Britain 's hospitals , ambulance services and community health services . 
Speaking to BBC Radio today , National Health Service Providers CEO Chris Hopson said London hospitals had increased critical care capacity by between five and seven times in the past couple of weeks to cope with the extra need . 
But Hopson said hospitals in London were struggling to meet the " explosion of demand " because of " the number of patients that are arriving and the speed at which they ’re arriving and how ill they are . " 
He added : Meanwhile , Dyson — a company best known for its hand dryers and vacuum cleaners — has received an order from the UK government for 10,000 ventilators to support efforts by the country 's health service to treat coronavirus patients .
