Between 75 to 100 children in the UK are estimated to have contracted a rare inflammatory disease linked to Covid 19 , a health official said Thursday . 
A 14 year old child in London has died of what is now called " multi system inflammatory syndrome in children " and cases have been found in the US and Europe . 
The syndrome resembles another childhood condition known as Kawasaki disease which typically affects children under the age of five . 
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health called it an " extremely rare condition " in a statement to CNN , adding they expect to have a better idea of the extent of the illness next week . 
British researchers at Evelina London Children ’s hospital said on Wednesday they had treated more than 20 children , all fit and well , with symptoms bearing resemblance to a severe form of Kawasaki disease . 
Their initial findings were published in a study in the Lancet . 
While the new syndrome also involves inflammation , infectious disease experts say it is different from Kawasaki disease . 
Symptoms include persistent fever , rash , red eyes , inflammation and poor function in one or more organs . 
In late April , Britain ’s National Health Service sent an " urgent alert " to doctors saying they had seen cases of atypical Kawasaki disease that could be linked to coronavirus . 
" Only some cases " get very , very sick . 
So parents need to be aware , but I do not think they need to be too concerned , " Viner said . 
Some older teenagers suffering from this disease appear " really washed out and tired , " potentially after having coronavirus . 
British researchers are working to establish the exact prevalence of the syndrome , he said .
