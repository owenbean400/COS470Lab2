The case was identified on March 12 and the government said it had traced all those who had come into contact with her . 
Kagwe told reporters the patient is " stable , her temperature has gone down to normal , she ’s been eating -- but she ca not be released until the test comes back as negative . " 
The government said in a statement that it was strengthening " measures to ensure no further transmission of the disease " in Kenya .
