Loss of taste or smell does indeed seem to be a symptom of Covid 19 infection , researchers reported Wednesday . 
A survey of more than 200 patients in Italy found that 67 % reported an altered sense of taste or smell either right before or right after they tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Dr . Daniele Borsetto of Guy ’s Hospital in London and colleagues said theirs was only the second medical study of what ’s called anosmia , despite many stories from patients who say they have experienced it . 
For their study , called the Sino nasal Outcome Test 22 or SNOT 22 , the researchers spoke to 202 Italian Covid 19 survivors by telephone . 
" Patients were contacted five to six days after the swab was performed , " they wrote in their report , published in the medical journal JAMA . 
They found that 130 of the patients reported some sort of altered taste or smell . 
That ’s 67 % . 
A third also reported having had a blocked nose , which can alter taste and smell . 
The loss of taste or smell is not necessarily a precursor to other symptoms . 
Only 12 % reported it as their first symptom . 
About a quarter said they lost smell or taste along with their other symptoms and another 27 % noticed it as the last symptom . 
Just 3 % said it was their only symptom . 
" If these results are confirmed , consideration should be given to testing and self isolation of patients with new onset of altered taste or smell during the Covid 19 pandemic , " the researchers concluded .
