London ’s transport operator is in a " critical " financial situation and needs to reach an agreement with the government in the next 48 hours , London ’s Deputy Mayor for Transport Heidi Alexander said Tuesday . 
Alexander told a Transport For London ( TFL ) finance committee that the local government body may be forced to issue a Section 114 notice , which is the equivalent of a public body going bust , if an agreement is not reached . 
Across London , tube travel has been reduced by 95 % and bus travel by 85 % during the coronavirus outbreak , TFL said in a statement on Monday . 
On April 24 , the organization announced it had furloughed 7,000 staff -- around 25 % of its workforce -- under the government ’s coronavirus job retention scheme . 
It said this would save it an estimated £ 15.8 million ( $ 19.3 million ) every four weeks . 
However , a TFL document submitted to Tuesday ’s committee says its loss from the " steep decline " in revenue for the full year is anticipated to be over £ 4 billion ( $ 4.9 billion ) and the remaining gap to balance its proposed Emergency Budget for 2020/21 is around £ 3.2 billion . 
It says TFL is in ongoing discussions around how this should be funded with the Department for Transport and HM Treasury . 
CNN has contacted the Department for Transport for comment .
