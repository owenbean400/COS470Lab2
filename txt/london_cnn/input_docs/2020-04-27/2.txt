The UK government ’s coronavirus restrictions are confusing and are making the job of police even harder than it already is , according to London ’s Metropolitan Police Federation chief Ken Marsh . 
" My colleagues are the ones being asked -- on an hourly , daily basis -- to put this into practice , " Marsh told BBC Radio 5 . 
" And when you ’re trying to ask two people not to sit on a bench , and my colleague looks over his or her shoulder and sees 300 people queueing to go to a DIY store without a piece of paper between them , then what do we do ? " 
He said there had been " mixed messages " coming from the government about what is allowed and what is not . 
Marsh said that in the past few days , an increasing number of DIY stores had opened up and the volume of traffic on the roads had been increasing " quite heavily . " 
Meanwhile , the UK government is inviting members of the public to submit questions to the daily coronavirus press briefings via the website gov.uk/ask . 
The government says an independent polling organization will choose one question a day , which will not be seen or heard by the ministers before it is asked live . 
The briefings have been held by a rotating group of government ministers , with journalists asking questions via video conference . 
Members of the public whose submissions are selected can either record a video of themselves asking their question , or have it read out loud during the briefing .
