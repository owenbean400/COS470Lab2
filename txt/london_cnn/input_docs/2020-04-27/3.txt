The court hearing on whether Julian Assange will be extradited from the UK to the United States is set to be adjourned until September because of the coronavirus . 
Citing fears around the virus , Edward Fitzgerald , QC , Assange ’s lawyer , said the " evidence is it would not be medically safe for Assange to attend a video conference , " according to News Central UK , a British court reporting service . 
Fitzgerald said that for " over a month " his team have had no direct access to the Wiki Leaks founder , who is being held at Belmarsh prison in south east London , where visits have not been possible . 
He said " there have always been great difficulties in seeking access to Mr . Assange but with the coronavirus outbreak the preparation of this case goes from difficult to impossible , " the court reporting service said . 
He said that should the hearing go ahead on May 18 , Assange " would be fighting a David and Goliath battle with his hands behind his back . " 
Assange ’s lawyer concluded that " for all these reasons we submit it is the fairest course to adjourn the matter from May to fix it for September when a realistic date can be settled on . " 
The judge presiding over proceedings , District Judge Vanessa Baraitser agreed that the extradition hearing should be adjourned . 
An administrative hearing will be heard on May 4 . 
Assange is wanted in America for allegedly conspiring with US military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to expose classified US intelligence back in 2010 . 
He was granted political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 and was arrested in April 2019 in London .
