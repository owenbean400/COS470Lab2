Pharmaceutical company Glaxo Smith Kline says it has plans for next year to manufacture 1 billion doses of its pandemic vaccine adjuvant - a booster that potentially could help make any Covid 19 vaccine stronger and possibly aid in scaling up production . 
The London based company said in a statement on Thursday that its adjuvant has been shown to reduce the amount of vaccine required per dose , which allows more vaccine doses to be produced . 
An adjuvant also is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response , which creates stronger immunity against infections . 
GSK said it will make the vaccine adjuvant technology available to partners that are developing " promising " Covid 19 vaccine candidates , and that making the adjuvant available to the world 's " poorest countries " would be key . 
" We believe that our innovative pandemic adjuvant technology has the potential to help improve the efficacy and scale up of multiple COVID 19 vaccines , " Connor said . 
Some background : In April , GSK and French drugmaker Sanofi announced they will be collaborating to develop a vaccine for Covid 19 , with clinical trials expected to begin in the second half of 2020 . 
They are among dozens of companies around the world working to develop a Covid 19 vaccine .
