Spencer Suckling has been driving one of London 's famous red buses for 16 years . 
In that time , he ’s dealt with rude passengers , stressed commuters and speeding motorists . 
But the Covid 19 pandemic has brought new dangers for transport workers in the British capital . 
Suckling was spat at by a moped driver during an altercation with the man two weeks ago in south London . 
The moped was speeding and Suckling pointed that out to the driver . 
Suckling kept his cool . 
He sounded the alarm on his bus . 
British Transport Police officers were not far away but the moped driver fled before they could catch him . 
" I was extremely shocked and alarmed . 
With what is going on , I was a little worried and scared . 
Before I even thought ‘ oh that is disgusting ’ my first thought was Covid 19 , " he said . 
He spent seven days in isolation after the incident . 
In the past two weeks London ’s Metropolitan Police force has arrested six people for assaults on the city ’s bus drivers alone . 
Yet transport workers have not only caught Covid 19 , but have died from it . 
The virus has killed more than 40 workers in the city , according to the Transport for London transit authority . 
Belly Mujinga , a railway ticket office worker , was also spat at and coughed on by a man claiming he had coronavirus , while working at London 's Victoria train station . 
She died 14 days later . 
Thankfully , Suckling had no symptoms and is now back at work , doing the job he takes great pride in . 
And despite this incident , he has not lost faith in the public in these unprecedented times . 
" For once in my 16 years I think I have seen the public actually appreciate frontline workers , especially bus drivers . 
A lot of appreciation , at last , for what the bus driver does , " he said . 
As the UK starts to move out of lockdown from next week , these bus drivers will be key to keeping London moving in the weeks and months ahead .
