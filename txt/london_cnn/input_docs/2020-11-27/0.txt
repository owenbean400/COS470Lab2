Local authorities across England could see their coronavirus risk category de escalated before Christmas as part of a mid December review period , UK Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Friday . 
But Jenrick cautioned that any adjustments to local tiers would require careful consideration , highlighting the potential for local infection rates to rise over the holiday period . 
" There will be an opening over the Christmas period which is likely to drive some higher rates of infection , if some people choose to meet family and friends for Christmas Day and the days surrounding it , so we have to bear that in mind , " Jenrick said . 
The updated tier system includes tougher restrictions . 
London will be placed in the tier 2 " high alert " risk category , while cities including Greater Manchester , Birmingham , Leicester and Bristol will be placed in the highest tier 3 " very high alert " category . 
A review of the national tier system is expected to take place on or around Dec . 16
