The novel coronavirus that has devastated the Chinese economy is having a ripple effect across the globe . 
The food we eat , the work we do and the clothes we wear -- many are daily reminders of the vital role China plays in the global economy .

The co operative usually exports more than 90 % of its catch to China . 
The co operative was forced to cut its buying price to $ 0 , to stop fishermen from bringing in lobsters than it could not sell on . 
The price has since crept back up ; as for the backlog , some stocks will be frozen , while other sellers are looking for other international buyers .

She has not been able to source new products for nearly a month , as her suppliers have been unable to commute to their factories , many of which were closed .
