Trials for specially trained sniffer dogs that may be able to detect coronavirus in humans , even before symptoms appear , are set to begin in London . 
Researchers hope to determine whether the dogs could be used as a potential new " non invasive , early warning measure to detect coronavirus in the future , " the United Kingdom government said on Saturday . 
The trial will look at whether the six dogs , called " The Super Six , " a mixture of labradors and cocker spaniels , can be trained to detect coronavirus from odor samples . 
Respiratory diseases are known to change body odor , according to the researchers , who hope dogs can detect the virus as they have been able to do with malaria . 
The researchers have already trained dogs to detect the odor of many different diseases in humans , such as cancer , malaria and Parkinson â€™s disease . 
" We are sure our dogs will be able to find the odor of Covid 19 and we will then move into a second phase to test them in live situations , following which we hope to work with other agencies to train more dogs for deployment , " Guest said .
