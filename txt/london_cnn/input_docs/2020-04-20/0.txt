The Mayor of London , Sadiq Khan , says there is increasing evidence that people from ethnic minority backgrounds in Britain are being " disproportionately affected " by Covid 19 , saying it should act as a " wake up call " for fundamental change . 
In an opinion piece published in the Guardian newspaper on Monday , Khan points to a study showing that a third of those critically ill in hospital from coronavirus are from black , Asian and minority ethnic ( BAME ) communities , even though people from those groups make up just 14 percent of the population as a whole . 
" More and more , the notion that this epidemic is some kind of " great leveller " is being exposed for what it is – a complete myth , " Khan writes . 
He says the reasons for the disparity are complex and varied , but says people from BAME communities are more likely to be employed in frontline roles , as health workers , supermarket shelf stackers and bus drivers . 
" One of the biggest underlying factors driving the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities is socioeconomic , " he says . 
" It ’s an uncomfortable truth that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented in poor , overcrowded accommodation , or households with multiple generations under one roof . 
And it ’s a fact that they are more likely to live in poverty or work in precarious and low paid jobs . 
Many simply do not have the luxury of being able to work safely from home during the lockdown . " 
" This must be a wake up call for our country and a catalyst for far reaching and fundamental change , " he says , adding : " Once this crisis is over , we will need to forge a new social contract that advances the twin causes of racial and economic equality , and prioritises the welfare and wellbeing of every single community in this country . " 
Khan says there needs to be real time collection of data about the ethnicity of those who contract coronavirus .
