Police have urged anti lockdown protesters gathering in central London on Saturday to maintain social distancing and warned that violence towards officers will not be tolerated . 
A number of demonstrations are planned , including a large event in Trafalgar Square , a Metropolitan Police news release said . 
Protesters are expected to move on to Hyde Park . 
Commander Ade Adelekan , who is leading the police operation , said officers would continue to take the approach of engaging , explaining and encouraging people to following the regulations . 
While it is currently illegal in England for people to gather in groups of more than six , there is an exemption for protests . 
However , protest organizers must submit a risk assessment and comply with social distancing . 
According to the Metropolitan Police , some organizers have submitted risk assessments for Saturday 's demonstrations but others have not . 
Adelekan urged against a repeat of the hostility police reported at demonstrations last weekend , which he said resulted in injuries to 15 officers and more than 30 arrests . 
" Last weekend it was highly disappointing to see that a small minority of demonstrators targeted officers with violence , " he said . 
" I will not tolerate a repeat of this behaviour this weekend and officers will respond quickly to any scenes of violence . " 
London was on Friday added to the national Covid 19 watchlist amid concern over rising coronavirus case numbers .
