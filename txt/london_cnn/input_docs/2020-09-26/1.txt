Police have told anti lockdown protesters in central London 's Trafalgar Square to disperse after they failed to follow the rules on social distancing . 
Images from Trafalgar Square show large crowds of people packed together , with few if any face coverings to be seen . 
Protesters carried placards with slogans such as " No to mandatory vaccines " and " Where is the pandemic ? " 
" We want to be clear , this protest is no longer exempt from the regulations . 
We are asking those attending to disperse , " the Metropolitan Police Service said on Twitter . 
" Sadly , some officers have been injured while engaging with people . " 
While it is currently illegal in England for people to gather in groups of more than six , there is an exemption for protests . 
However , protest organizers must submit a risk assessment and comply with social distancing . 
According to the police , those conditions have not been met . 
" Crowds in Trafalgar Square have not complied with the conditions of their risk assessment and are putting people in danger of transmitting the virus , " the force said . 
" This has voided their risk assessment and we have informed the event organisers they are no longer exempt from the regulations . " 
Some protesters are now moving toward Hyde Park , police said .
