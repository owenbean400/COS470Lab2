The National Football League has issued a statement regarding Dr . Anthony Fauci ’s comments on Thursday saying , " football may not happen this year . " 
Dr . Allen Sills , NFL chief medical officer , said in a statement that the organization will " make adjustments as necessary to meet the public health environment as we prepare to play the 2020 season . " 
Sills continued : " Make no mistake , this is no easy task . 
We will make adjustments as necessary to meet the public health environment as we prepare to play the 2020 season as scheduled with increased protocols and safety measures for all players , personnel and attendees . 
We will be flexible and adaptable in this environment to adjust to the virus as needed . " 
Some background : Earlier this week , Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , told CNN 's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupta , " Unless players are essentially in a bubble — insulated from the community and they are tested nearly every day — it would be very hard to see how football is able to be played this fall . 
If there is a second wave , which is certainly a possibility and which would be complicated by the predictable flu season , football may not happen this year . " 
In May , the NFL canceled all planned international games due to the pandemic , moving them instead to the US . 
The league had previously planned to play four games in London and one game in Mexico City .
