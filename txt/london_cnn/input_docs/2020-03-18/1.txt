The UK 's largest pharmacy chain Boots has joined other retailers in imposing rations on items like hand sanitizer , as shoppers panic buy products during the coronavirus outbreak . 
In Boots stores across London , items like thermometers , paracetemol and hand soap have sold out . 
Hand soap sales alone are at about 1,000 % of usual levels , the company says . 
" Clearly people are very anxious , " Boots Chief Operating Officer for the UK and Ireland Tracey Clements told CNN . 
" So customers may find we have [ a product ] for a part of the day , but not the whole of the day , but we continue to try and procure as much as possible . " 
Supermarket chain Sainsbury 's also announced it would implement a series of measures , including some to help the elderly and vulnerable ensure they get the items they need . 
" We will set aside the first hour in every supermarket this Thursday 19th March for elderly and vulnerable customers , " Sainsbury 's Chief Executive Officer Mike Coupe said in a statement shared on Twitter on Wednesday . 
" We will also help elderly and vulnerable customers to access food online . 
From Monday 23rd March , our online customers who are over 70 years of age or have a disability will have priority access to online delivery slots . "
