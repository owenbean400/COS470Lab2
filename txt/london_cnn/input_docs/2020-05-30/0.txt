London Mayor Sadiq Khan has urged citizens to " act with caution " as the UK government prepares to ease lockdown measures on Monday . 
" The Joint Biosecurity Centre has said we â€™re not ready to move from Level 4 to 3 , and the 5 tests are not met . 
I urge Londoners to act with caution -- lives depend on it , " he said . 
Earlier on Saturday , members of the scientific advisory board to the UK government -- SAGE -- warned that a premature easing of the coronavirus lockdown could lead to a " significant " number of new cases and deaths across the country . 
Speaking to Sky News on Saturday , SAGE adviser and epidemiologist Professor John Edmunds said that the easing of the lockdown would be " risky " and warned that a relaxation of containment measures could lead to some 8,000 new cases of coronavirus every day . 
" Significant numbers of cases , unfortunately , means we will get deaths , " he said .
