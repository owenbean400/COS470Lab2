CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour is tuning into the town hall from London , where she 's been covering the outbreak in the UK . 
Shortages : " There is a national shortage of nurses , " she said . 
" Testing kits are in short supply , not only here but around the world . " 
Preventative measures : " There is a sense that they might have to go into methods such as controlling how people work , keep them at home more . 
And it 's called social mitigation . 
So also as you were talking about how do people deal with each other , social distancing , for instance . 
There is a huge amount of talk about should people shake hands , should they hug , kiss . " 
" The main advice that people here are being given is wash your hands , and wash them over and over again . 
And if you use sanitizer , use something that 's at least 60 % alcohol contained . "
