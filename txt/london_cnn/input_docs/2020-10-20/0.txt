The United Kingdom government has signed a contract with Open Orphan allowing the Irish pharmaceutical services company to conduct the first human challenge studies for the novel coronavirus , in which healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the virus in a controlled setting . 
Some participants will receive an experimental vaccine . 
Up to 19 volunteers at a time will take part in the trials , which will be held at the Royal Free Hospital in London , which houses a biosafety ward . 
The trials will be run by h VIVO , a subsidiary of Open Orphan , in partnership with Imperial College London . 
The first steps will take place early next year , the company said . 
It expects to be able to test the efficacy of up to three vaccine candidates sometime next year . 
In a statement , UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the " ground breaking but carefully controlled studies " mark an " important next step " in Britain â€™s fight against coronavirus . 
While the study will still need to get ethics approval from UK regulators , England 's Heath Research Authority said it has already set up an ethics committee to assess any challenge trial proposals .
