Parts of Britain will go back into lockdown during Christmas after a newly identified strain of Covid 19 has proved to spread more quickly than previous strains of the virus . 
The British prime minister broke the news Saturday that London and the south east of England where cases are surging , will go into tier 4 restrictions on Sunday , which is akin to a lockdown . 
" This is now spreading very fast , " he added . 
" It is with a very heavy heart that I say we cannot continue with Christmas as planned . " 
Johnson outlined that in areas under the toughest restrictions , there will be no possibility for household mixing over Christmas . 
In areas under tier 3 , mixing will now be restricted to Christmas Day . 
Earlier this week Johnson had ruled that up to three households could mix over the Christmas week . 
The entire nation is being asked not to travel and those under the highest level of restrictions will not be allowed to travel abroad except for work purposes .
