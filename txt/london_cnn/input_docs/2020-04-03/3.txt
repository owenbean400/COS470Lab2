Heathrow Airport will " transition to single runway operations " due to the " unprecedented impact that the coronavirus outbreak is having on Heathrow â€™s operation . " 
In a statement to CNN , Heathrow said that single runway operations will commence on April 6 . 
The airport will alternate which runway is used on a weekly basis : 27R or 09L . 
The statement continued to say that Heathrow will remain open so that it can " play a crucial role in helping to secure vital medical goods and food for the nation during the unprecedented epidemic . " 
The change is the latest change at all major London airports due to the coronavirus outbreak . 
London City airport closed last month to all commercial and private flights .
