A man who worked for the UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) for 20 years was " neglected " by his employer after he contracted Covid 19 and died , alleges his daughter Tamira Harvey . 
Although Thomas Harvey never got a test for Covid 19 before he died , an NHS Trust confirmed to CNN that he had picked up the virus . 
According to his daughter , the 57 year old health care assistant was let down by both the hospital where he helped care for recovering stroke patients , and by emergency responders . 
Tamira alleges that London 's Goodmayes Hospital failed to provide necessary personal protective equipment ( PPE ) to her father . 
And just a few days before Harvey 's death , emergency services " refused " to come to take him to hospital , Tamira says , despite family concerns that he was not " breathing properly . " 
The NHS trust responsible for the hospital where Thomas Harvey worked told CNN on Wednesday that there were no symptomatic patients when he went off work sick . 
CNN reached out to NHS England via phone and email and has yet to receive a response . 
The London Ambulance Service ( LAS ) said they were " seeing unprecedented demand " for both their 999 and 111 services at this time . 
But Tamira remains adamant that the blame for her father 's death should ultimately lie in the hands of the UK government . 
Boris Johnson 's government has been criticized in recent days for the small number of NHS workers who have received tests for Covid 19 .
