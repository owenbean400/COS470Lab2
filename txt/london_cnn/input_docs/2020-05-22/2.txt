Prince Charles recorded a video message to support the " Remember Me " project , saying the pandemic had resulted in sudden change in British society . 
" This virtual book of remembrance is here to help us remember ; not just to recall our loss and sorrow , but also to be thankful for everything good that those we have loved brought into our lives , and all that they have given to others . " 
The project would be an opportunity to mourn those who have died and recognize the impact of the pandemic , said David Ison , the cathedral 's dean . 
" For centuries , St . Paul 's Cathedral has been a place to remember the personal and national impact of great tragedies , from the losses of war to the devastation of the Grenfell Tower fire , " he said .
