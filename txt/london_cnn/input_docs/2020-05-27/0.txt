Junior UK minister Douglas Ross has resigned from the British government over the controversy surrounding Boris Johnson 's senior adviser , Dominic Cummings , who traveled more than 250 miles from his London home during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown in March . 
Some context : Ross ' resignation follows a press statement made by Cummings on Monday , in which the aide admitted to travelling to Durham in northern England during the lockdown , despite the fact that his wife was ill . 
Cummings said he made the trip to ensure the welfare of his child , asserting that while his wife had fallen ill in London , she did not have symptoms of coronavirus . 
" I was worried that if both my wife and I were seriously ill , possibly hospitalized , there is nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid , " Cummings said . 
Ross said that while Cummings ' intentions " may have been well meaning , " the subsequent reaction to the news " shows that Mr Cummings interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked . " 
" I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior advisor to the government was right . "
