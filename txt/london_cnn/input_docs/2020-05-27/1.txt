The young man admitted to the Newton Wellesley hospital in Massachusetts was clearly very ill -- so ill that he needed the help of a ventilator to breathe . 
The doctors treating him were certain he was infected with the new coronavirus . 
It was mid April -- the height of the outbreak in the Boston area . 
The patient had trouble breathing and had other symptoms . 
But the first swab test for coronavirus came back negative . 
A second test , 24 hours later , came up negative , too . 
So they tried a different approach . 
" The clinical team reached out to me for help in testing a tracheal aspirate , " Dr . Michael Misialek , a pathologist at Newton Wellesley Hospital outside Boston , told CNN . 
That 's a test that takes a sample from deeper in the respiratory system . 
It uses a different technique , but doctors are increasingly reporting that they cannot find evidence of Covid 19 infection until they perform such tests . 
This tracheal secretion came back positive . 
" That allowed the team to enroll the patient in a clinical trial , " Misialek said . 
He was treated with one of several immune based drugs being tried out on coronavirus patients , eventually recovered and was discharged from hospital . 
Similar cases were taking place around the world . 
In London , New York , and elsewhere , health workers were seeing patients arrive with severe symptoms -- but then test negative for Covid 19 . 
Why is this happening ? 
Some studies are beginning to indicate that when patients are severely ill , the virus is replicating deeper in the respiratory system , beyond the reach of the swabs used for most of the testing , experts say . 
Dozens of tests are on the market , but their reliability varies greatly . 
Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) tests , which look for evidence of the virus , are usually reliable -- but not always .
