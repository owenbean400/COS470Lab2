Astra Zeneca has approached rival drugmaker Gilead about a potential merger , according to a Bloomberg report . 
Neither company responded to requests for comment on Monday , but if the transaction were to take place , it would unite two of the leading players in the fight against coronavirus in the biggest health care deal on record . 
Astra Zeneca has secured production capacity to make 2 billion doses of a potential vaccine , while the experimental Gilead drug remdesivir has been approved by the US government to treat hospitalized patients with severe Covid 19 . 
Shares in Astra Zeneca dropped by more than 2 % in London -- even as the FTSE 100 index rose -- after Bloomberg reported that the UK based company had made a preliminary approach last month to US firm Gilead . 
The two companies have a combined stock market value of nearly $ 140 billion . 
What 's behind the move ?

Its report also said that Gilead discussed the idea with advisers , but the companies were not in formal discussions .

Still , Gilead does have something Astra Zeneca does not â€” plenty of cash .
