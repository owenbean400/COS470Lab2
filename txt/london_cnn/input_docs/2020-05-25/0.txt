The UK Cabinet Office is investigating how an " unauthorised tweet " was sent from the official Civil Service Twitter account that appeared to be critical of Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s government . 
The tweet – sent just after Johnson gave a televised press briefing – said : " arrogant and offensive . 
Can you imagine having to work with these truth twisters ? " 
The tweet went viral before it was deleted , with screenshots shared widely on social media and the post liked by thousands of people . 
While it is not confirmed what prompted the tweet , many have speculated that it was directed at Johnson after he defended the actions of his senior adviser , Dominic Cummings . 
Cummings has come under fire for allegedly breaching national lockdown regulations after traveling to Durham – more than 250 miles ( 402 kilometers ) from his home in London – on two separate occasions . 
During his briefing on Sunday , Johnson said that while he acknowledges why people may feel " offended " by Cummings ’ apparent disregard for the government ’s emergency restrictions , he believes " most people will understand " his adviser ’s actions . 
According to a Downing Street spokesperson , Cummings acted " in line with coronavirus guidelines " and traveled to " ensure his young child could be properly cared for " after his wife became infected with suspected coronavirus .
