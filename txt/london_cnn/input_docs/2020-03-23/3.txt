As people across the globe worry about the well being of health care workers and the ability of small businesses to survive during the coronavirus pandemic , one restaurant in the UK found a way to tackle both . 
Crust Bros pizza in London has served up hundreds of pizzas to doctors , nurses and ambulance staff who are the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus . 
The best part ? 
The pizzas are donated in part by customers hoping to keep the pizzeria open . 
After the restaurant donated the first pizzas , Moore realized he could use the restaurant 's social media following to reach out to the local community and donate even more . 
He invited customers to " Pay it Forward " to Britain ’s National Health Service and donate a pizza themselves . 
" This afternoon we ’re going to be delivering about 300 more pizzas , " said Moore on Sunday . 
" And today we ’re going to have seven people working for the restaurant who otherwise would not . 
So this has enabled us to carry on . " 
It ’s a bittersweet final day for the restaurant — Crust Bros closed Sunday night , but Moore hopes to reopen in 12 weeks depending on announcements from the British government .
