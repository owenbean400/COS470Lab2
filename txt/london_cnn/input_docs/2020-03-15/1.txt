American Airlines is suspending most long haul international flights from the US between March 16 and May 6 , said the airline in a news release . 
Demand has plummeted amid virus concerns and new US government travel restrictions . 
The airline is reducing its international capacity by 75 % compared to last year . 
It will only continue three long haul international routes : one flight a day from Dallas to London , one from Miami to London , and three flights a week from Dallas to Tokyo . 
Short haul international flights , like those from the US to Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean , Central America , and certain parts of South America will continue . 
Domestic flights are not immune , however . 
The airline anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20 % compared to last year , and the number could fall to 30 % by May on a year over year basis .
