British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit on Monday after his condition with coronavirus symptoms " worsened , " his office said . 
By Tuesday morning , Johnson , 55 , was still in the ICU and had received oxygen support , Michael Gove , Minister for the Cabinet Office , said in an interview with the BBC . 
Here 's everything we know : Not on a ventilator : While Johnson has been treated with oxygen , the prime minister is not on a ventilator , according to Gove . 
" One of the reasons for being in intensive care is to make sure that whatever support the medical team consider to be appropriate , can be provided , " Gove said . 
Hospitalized on Sunday : Johnson was first admitted to St Thomas ' Hospital in London on Sunday evening for what he said were " routine tests " after his coronavirus symptoms persisted 10 days after testing positive . 
Intensive care : He was moved to the intensive care unit on Monday at around 7 p.m . , Downing Street said . 
The decision was made by the leader 's medical team after his condition worsened over the afternoon on Monday . 
Change in condition : The move strikes a sharp contrast to earlier reports on Johnson 's condition . 
During his period of self isolation , Downing Street had said that Johnson 's symptoms were " mild , " and on Sunday said his hospitalization was just a " precautionary step . " 
Who is running the country ? 
While Johnson is in hospital , Foreign Minister Dominic Raab is deputizing for the prime minister " where necessary . " 
Johnson was working less last week : The prime minister had a " stripped back diary " last week and was following the medical advice of his doctors , Gove told BBC Radio . 
" And all last week he was following the advice he was being given by his doctors -- he had a stripped back diary in order to make sure the appropriate medical advice could be followed . "
