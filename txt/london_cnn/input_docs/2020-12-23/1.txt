" I would urge everyone to review their plans for Christmas and to err on the side of caution , " Swann added . 
" Just because you can do something , it does not mean you have to . " 
Health authorities in the nation went on to say it is " increasingly likely " that the new variant has established itself across the UK and Ireland . 
" While virus mutation is not uncommon , the potential of this new strain to spread rapidly is cause for serious concern , " the Northern Ireland Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael Mc Bride said , according to the statement . 
" I would advise the public to act on the assumption that it is already well established in Northern Ireland and that the person they pass in the street or stand next to in a queue may have it . " 
" We protect ourselves and others from this new strain through taking the same vital steps and using the same methods we have been using since the start of the pandemic . "
