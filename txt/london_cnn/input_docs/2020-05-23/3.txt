Dominic Cummings , a senior adviser to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson , says he will not consider resigning following allegations he broke national lockdown regulations in March . 
Asked by reporters whether he would consider his position , the prime minister ’s adviser said " obviously not . " 
Pressed once again on whether he would resign in light of the general public ’s probable anger , Cummings said " I do not think so . " 
Some context : Cummings ' remarks come after an investigation by the Guardian and Mirror newspapers revealed that he had been spotted in late March in Durham , more than 250 miles from his London home — seemingly in contravention of the government 's lockdown regulations . 
Earlier on Saturday , Cummings addressed the allegations , telling reporters that he believes he behaved " reasonably and legally . " 
The British Labour Party has , in a letter to the Cabinet Secretary , called for an " urgent investigation " into allegations Cummings . 
" I am writing to request the Cabinet Office launch an urgent investigation into allegations Dominic Cummings broke the coronavirus lockdown rules , " Labour Minister Rachel Reeves wrote Saturday . 
" The British people have made important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort … it is therefore vital that the Government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone else . " 
According to a Downing Street spokesperson , Cummings acted " in line with coronavirus guidelines " and travelled to " ensure his young child could be properly cared for " after his wife had become infected with suspected coronavirus .
