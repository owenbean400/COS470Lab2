The leading epidemiologist who advised the UK government on the coronavirus response has resigned from his government post today after the Telegraph newspaper reported he broke lockdown rules . 
Professor Neil Ferguson , who is based at Imperial College in London , is one of the architects of the UK government stay at home strategy and was a prominent member of Britain 's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( SAGE ) , which has been spearheading the coronavirus response . 
In a statement to CNN , Ferguson said he accepted he made " an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action , " and therefore stepped back from his involvement in SAGE . 
" I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic . 
The government guidance is unequivocal , and is there to protect all of us , " Ferguson said .
