US governors were priming for battle against coronavirus as early as February but Donald Trump â€™s lackadaisical approach to the spreading disease hindered a national response , according to Maryland governor Larry Hogan , chairman of the National Governors Association . 
Trump initially was downplaying " the threat and saying this virus is going to disappear , " despite grave warnings from top national experts , Hogan told The Associated Press . 
" All of the leaders in the administration , the experts and the public health doctors at the ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) , they were aware and providing this information . 
And yet it seemed as if the president was downplaying it and saying , you know , this virus is going to disappear , " Hogan said . 
The biggest mistake in the first couple of months , the governor said , was not developing a national testing strategy . 
" Throughout the pandemic , it ( the federal government ) was not assisting the states enough with testing and now as its spiking back up again and we have a resurgence of this virus all across the country , the number one thing we can do is to put more into testing and contact tracing to identify and stop the spread , " Hogan said .
