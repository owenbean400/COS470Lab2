It took only 15 days for the total number of coronavirus cases in the US to go from 3 million to 4 million . 
In contrast , the number of US coronavirus cases surpassed 1 million 99 days after the country ’s first case was confirmed . 
The US currently accounts for about a quarter of all confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide , according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . 
The US hit the grim milestone of four million cases a day after Fox News aired an interview with Trump in which the president argued coronavirus tests are " overrated . " 
" To me , every time you test a case it gets reported in the news , we found more cases , " he said . 
" If instead of 50 we did 25 , we have half the number of cases . 
So I personally think it ’s overrated , but I am totally willing to keep doing it . " 
The United States just reached 4 million reported coronavirus cases:0 to 1 million cases : 99 days1 to 2 million cases : 43 days2 to 3 million cases : 28 days3 to 4 million cases : 15 days
