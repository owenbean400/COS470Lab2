The US government will send an " overwhelming majority " of the rapid Covid 19 tests it purchased from Abbott Laboratories last week to governors of states and territories to support school reopenings and other critical tasks . 
Other top priorities for the newly purchased tests include day care centres , first responders , and " critical infrastructure , " said Admiral Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
The tests will be distributed in collaboration with Abbott beginning in mid September , Giroir said . 
Abbott said last week it will ramp up production to around 50m tests per month by mid October . 
The US government agreed to purchase 150m rapid antigen tests for Covid 19 from Abbott in a roughly $ 750m deal . 
The portable tests can deliver results within 15 minutes and will sell for $ 5 . 
They require no additional equipment , and can use a less invasive nasal swab than traditional lab tests . 
Antigen tests are cheaper and faster than molecular diagnostic tests , but somewhat more likely to fail to identify positive cases of the virus than lab based diagnostic tests . 
President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for schools to reopen , but most of the largest US school districts have said they would start the school year with online classes . 
Giroir also said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) still supports testing asymptomatic individuals for Covid 19 who are prioritised by local health officials or in high risk populations . 
Last week , the CDC sparked outcry among many public health officials when it said testing some asymptomatic people may not be necessary . 
The United States has conducted 85m Covid 19 tests so far with a positivity rate of just over 5 % , Giroir said . 
The mean turnaround time is 2.27 days .
