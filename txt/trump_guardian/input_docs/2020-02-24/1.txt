The US department of homeland security ’s top official on the White House ’s coronavirus task force has sought help on social media accessing a map about the virus . 
Ken Cuccinelli , the DHS acting deputy secretary , first asked on Twitter if a link to the map stopped working for other people ( it worked for the Guardian ) . 
In a second post , he said it looked like he could not access it because it was behind a paywall . 
" Seems like bad timing to stop helping the world with this ( previously ) useful resource , " tweeted the senior member of the Trump administration . 
" Here ’s hoping it goes back up soon . " 
Ken Cuccinelli , the # 2 official at Homeland Security , is top DHS official on the Trump admin ’s coronavirus task force . 
Someone please get him a Johns Hopkins membership .
