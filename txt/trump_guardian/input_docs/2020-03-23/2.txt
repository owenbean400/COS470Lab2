A bizarre moment of comedy came earlier in this press conference . 
" Saturday , I had a little low grade fever , " Dr . Deborah Birx said . 
" Uh oh , " President Trump says , and backs away from the podium . 
( She said she got a test and tested negative , and the president eventually moved back . ) 
Birx : " Saturday , I had a little low grade fever . " 
Trump jokes , " Oh oh ! " and recoils in cartoon fashion . 
Birx says she tested negative . 
Trump says , " Phew ! "
