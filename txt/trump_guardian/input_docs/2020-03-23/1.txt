Trump has repeatedly suggested that a damaged American economy could create " more death " than potential deaths from the coronavirus . 
" People get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicide over things like this , when you have a terrible economy , you have death , definitely would be in far greater numbers than we ’re talking about with regard to the virus , " Trump said . 
" We have a double obligation . 
We have a great country , there ’s no country like it in the world , and there ’s no economy like it in the world . " 
Trump : " This is going away . 
We 're going to win the battle . 
But we have tremendous responsibility . " 
You have suicides in terrible economies .
