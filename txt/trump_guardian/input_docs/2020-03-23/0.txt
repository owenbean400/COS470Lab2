Major theme of this press conference : Trump wants to get the American economy going again as soon as possible , and is not open to the idea of restrictive public health measures going on for months . 
Asked what he would do if , a week from now , public health experts asked him to extend public health restrictions , Trump said , " We ’ll see what happens . " 
Later , Trump said that very soon " we ’re going to be opening up our country . " 
Asked by a reporter if that meant " weeks or months , " Trump s aid , " I ’m not looking at months , I can tell you right now . " 
Trump is asked what will happen if , a week from now , doctors want him to maintain restrictions but he wants to start reopening the economy."We ’ll see what happens , " he says . 
" We can do two things at one time." ( Health officials will certainly say : no , we really ca not . )
