NBC news is reporting that the White House is " seeking to discredit Dr . Anthony Fauci , " as Trump struggles to gain control over the coronavirus pandemic : In a remarkable broadside by the Trump administration against one of its own , a White House official said Sunday that " several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr . Fauci has been wrong on things . " 
The official gave NBC News a list of nearly a dozen past comments by Fauci that the official said had ultimately proven erroneous . 
Among them : Fauci â€™s comments in January that the coronavirus was " not a major threat " and his guidance in March that " people should not be walking around with masks . " 
It was a move more characteristic of a political campaign furtively disseminating opposition research about an opponent than of a White House struggling to contain a pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 people , according to an NBC News tally .
