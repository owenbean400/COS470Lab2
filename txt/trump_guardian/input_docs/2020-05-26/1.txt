Here is the full story on Twitter labelling Trump ’s false claims with a warning for the first time . 
The Guardian ’s Julia Carrie Wong reports from San Francisco with Sam Levine in New York : Twitter for the first time took action against a series of tweets by Donald Trump , labeling them with a warning sign and providing a link to further information . 
Since ascending to the US presidency , Trump has used his Twitter account to threaten a world leader with war , amplify racist misinformation by British hate figures and , as recently as Tuesday morning , spread a lie about the 2001 death of a congressional aide in order to smear a cable news pundit . 
Throughout it all , Twitter has remained steadfast in its refusal to censor the head of state , even going so far as to write a new policy to allow itself to leave up tweets by " world leaders " that violate its rules . 
The company ’s decision on Tuesday afternoon to affix labels to a series of Trump tweets about California ’s election planning is a result of a new policy debuted on 11 May . They were applied – hours after the tweets initially went out – because Trump ’s tweets violated Twitter ’s " civic integrity policy " , a company spokeswoman confirmed , which bars users from " manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes " , such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election .
