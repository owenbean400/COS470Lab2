Donald Trump said his administration was considering further economic measures , possibly via executive orders , to provide help against the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic . 
In remarks to reporters at the White House , the US president appeared to confirm the possibility of further postponement of the deadline for filing 2019 federal income tax returns , already extended by three months to July 15 . 
" Things could happen like that . 
We have to help people , " he said in response to a question about the tax deadline and economic measures that would not require congressional action . 
" We can do things ... through executive order or otherwise that can help a lot of people ... like delays . 
We can do delays of various files . ... 
I can see that happening , " he said . 
Congress has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $ 3 trillion , including payments of $ 1,200 to many individuals and more than $ 650 billion in loans to small businesses . 
Asked whether there would be more direct payments to individuals , Trump said : " Well , something could happen . 
There ’s talk about something happening . 
We ’ll see what ’s going on . "
