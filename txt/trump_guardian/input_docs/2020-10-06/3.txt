Six US states reported record numbers of patients hospitalised with Covid 19 , including Wisconsin , where officials on Tuesday issued a new order limiting the size of indoor public gatherings , Reuters reports . 
The surge of hospitalisations and new cases in some states coincides with the president Donald Trump and several members of his White House staff testing positive for coronavirus . 
Trump ’s doctors on Tuesday said he was not displaying any acute symptoms after he left the Walter Reed Medical Center , where he was treated for three days . 
The rise in reported hospitalisations on Monday hit states in the Midwest the hardest , with Montana , Nebraska , North Dakota , South Dakota , and Wyoming reporting their highest figures , according to a Reuters tally . 
Wisconsin has 782 hospitalised patients , compared with 433 two weeks ago . Wisconsin ’s Department of Health Services issued a directive that gatherings will be limited to no more than 25 % of a room or building ’s total occupancy . 
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said in a statement : We ’re in a crisis right now and need to immediately change our behaviour to save lives . 
We are continuing to experience a surge in cases and many of our hospitals are overwhelmed , and I believe limiting indoor public gatherings will help slow the spread of this virus .
