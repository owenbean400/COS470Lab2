Here is more on US president Donald Trump calling for an in person G7 meeting . 
Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face to face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington , after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
" I am considering rescheduling the G 7 , on the same or similar date , in Washington , D.C . , at the legendary Camp David , " the US president tweeted on Wednesday . 
" The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK . 
It would be a great sign to all – normalization ! " 
In March , the Republican president canceled the physical summit scheduled for June , moving to a video conference as nations grappled with the shutdown of international travel and multiple closures to fight the outbreak . 
The leaders ’ April and May discussions were also moved to teleconference . 
But Trump , who is head of the G7 this year , said an in person summit would be a symbol of the United States and other countries seeking to return to normal , something the president has urged should happen quickly despite concerns from public health experts . 
As we reported earlier , French president , Emmanuel Macron , is open to traveling to the United States for an in person meeting of G7 leaders if the coronavirus pandemic situation allows , an Elysee official said on Wednesday .
