The former US president Barack Obama criticised some officials overseeing the coronavirus response on Saturday , telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials " are not even pretending to be in charge " . 
Obama spoke on Show Me Your Walk , HBCU Edition , a two hour livestreaming event for historically black colleges and universities broadcast on You Tube , Facebook and Twitter . 
His remarks were surprisingly political and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts . 
" More than anything , this pandemic has fully , finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they ’re doing , " he said . 
Obama did not name president Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials .
