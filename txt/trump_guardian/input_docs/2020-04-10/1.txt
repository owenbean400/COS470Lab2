Asked whether he would open up the US again next month if his advisers presented him with evidence that there would be a dramatic spike of coronavirus cases , Trump has said he wants to get it open as soon as possible . 
But he is not determined , the president said in response to a question from CNN ’s Jim Acosta . 
I do say this Jim : I want to get it open as soon as possible . 
I would love to open it . 
I ’m not determined . 
He said that he would unveil a new task force of council to advise him on dealing with coronavirus and when to reopen the country . 
He said he would discuss it more next week Trump said it would be bipartisan . 
The one thing I did not ask : ‘ Are you a Republican or Democrat ? ’ 
And I want their views on what they think .
