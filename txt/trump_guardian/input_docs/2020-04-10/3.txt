In Washington , Trump has said that deciding whether to ease recommendations on social distancing might be one of the biggest decisions , if not the biggest one , he ’ll have to make . 
Pressed on whether the United States has enough medical equipment and whether Trump offers too rosy a picture at his briefings , the president said he believes the country has enough equipment and that he did not enjoy speaking at these press conferences . 
The comments from the president came in response to a question from CNN ’s Jim Acosta . 
These are the saddest conferences I ’ve ever had . 
I do not like doing them . 
Why ? 
Because I ’m talking about death ... there ’s no happy talk Jim . 
This is the real deal . 
And I ’ve got to make the biggest decision of my life and I ’ve only started thinking about that . 
This is by far the biggest decision of my life . 
Trump went on to say the country has enough equipment . 
" It ’s not ‘ no no no ’ it ’s yes yes yes , ’ " Trump said .
