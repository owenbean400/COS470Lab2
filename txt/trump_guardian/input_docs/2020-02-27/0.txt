Trump has been rambling a bit , blaming the federal reserve , Boeing , General Motors , and Obama , for drops in the US market . 
Q : Are you telling Americans , apart from the ones who are sick , not to change any of their behaviours ? 
A : No , you should wash your hands , you do not have to grab every handrail , he says . 
Treat it like the flu . 
Then he tells an anecdote about a man who came up to him to say hello , and hugged Trump , and then said he was very ill , so Trump extricated himself . 
~~~ Q : In the course of the last few minutes you have disputed what some of the health officials standing behind you have said . 
Do not you trust them ? 
A : I have not disputed them . 
" I do not think it ’s inevitable " that there will be further outbreaks . 
" There ’s a chance it could get worse , a chance it could get fairly substantially worse , but I do not think it ’s inevitable . "
