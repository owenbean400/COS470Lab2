Recently there has been some tension in messaging about the virus from key members of the group . 
Fauci has cautioned that the US needs to have enough testing capacity to reopen safely , and is not yet at that stage .

" I do not think there ’s a chance that this virus is just going to disappear , " he told National Geographic .
