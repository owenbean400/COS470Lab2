Trump has said key advisers Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx will still be involved after the taskforce is dismantled , according to Reuters . 
He claimed the US is moving into a second phase , dealing with the aftermath of the outbreak and reopening services , even as the CDC announces another 823 deaths . 
Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job . 
But we ’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening and we ’ll have a different group probably set up for that . 
Asked if he was proclaiming " mission accomplished " in the fight against the pandemic , Trump said , " No , not at all . 
The mission accomplished is when it ’s over . "
