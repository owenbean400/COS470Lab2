Trump is asked if federal distancing will be extended until the US summer ? 
" We may , we may go beyond that - we ’ll have to see where it is . 
Until we feel it ’s safe , we ’re going to be extending , " Trump said . 
The president says he is " not happy about Brian Kemp " , referring to the governor of Georgia , who has moved ahead with a plan to reopen businesses despite criticisms from the president and other Republican and Democratic lawmakers . 
" I do not want this thing to flare up because you ’re deciding to do something that ’s not in the guidelines , " Trump said . 
Trump finishes the briefing by criticising the media ( " CNN is fake news . Do not talk to me . " ) , complaining about the " fake Russia , Russia , Russia deal " and the " illegal witch hunt , " ( impeachment ) and implying that the media is giving Joe Biden " a pass " , or an easy ride because of the virus . 
The briefing has now ended .
