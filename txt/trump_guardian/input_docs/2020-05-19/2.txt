In the US , Donald Trump has claimed that scientists carried out a study of the effects of hydroxychloroquine , the results of which suggested he is wrong to tout it , because they oppose him politically . 
The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8 % death rate , while those who did not had an 11.4 % death rate . 
Trump said : " That was a false study done . 
Where they gave it very sick people . 
Extremely sick people . 
People that were ready to die . 
It was given by obviously not friends of the administration " -- Trump defends hydroxychloroquine by suggesting a study of VA patients was fruit of a conspiracy Joanna Walters writes that Trump also falsely claimed evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine does not have negative side effects . 
In reality , the Food and Drug Administration has said it should only be used as a coronavirus treatment in hospital settings due to " reports of serious heart rhythm problems " in virus patients who had received the drug . 
When a reporter mentioned the FDA guidance , Trump said , " That ’s not what I was told . " 
* We originally inaccurately reported that this study was published in the New England Journal of Medecine . 
The research was published as a pre print — it has not yet gone through a rigorous process of peer review .
