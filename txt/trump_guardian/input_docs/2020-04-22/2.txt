Trump said he told Georgia Governor Brian Kemp that he disagreed strongly with Kemp ’s decision to begin allowing some nonessential businesses to reopen in the coming days . 
Speaking at a daily White House briefing Wednesday evening , Trump said he had spoken with Kemp over the phone . 
At the same time he must do what he thinks is right , Trump said of the Republican governor . 
Kemp ’s plan to begin cracking open the Georgia economy faces two major hurdles : the state is struggling to increase testing for new coronavirus infections and boost tracking of those in contact with infected people , AP reports . 
Without those capabilities , experts said Georgia risks a quick rebound of the Covid 19 illness as Kemp allows some businesses to reopen in coming days . 
The Republican governor ’s decision has been questioned because the state has yet to show continuing progress in those areas , and it could be difficult to catch up .
