The pharmaceutical company Sanofi has temporarily stopped recruiting new Covid 19 patients for two clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine and will no longer supply the anti malaria drug to treat Covid 19 until concerns about safety are cleared up , it has said . 
The moves come after the World Health Organization paused its large trial of hydroxychloroquine , prompting several European governments to ban the use of the drug , also used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . 
That dealt a major blow to hopes for a treatment , touted by the US president Donald Trump , as drugmakers and governments race to find ways to treat patients and control the spread of the virus .
