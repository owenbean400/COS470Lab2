Making the announcement earlier , Trump accused the WHO of failing to adequately respond to the pandemic because he believes it is controlled by China . 
He also noted that the body was much more dependent on funding from Washington than on that from Beijing . 
The US is the largest single source of financial support to the WHO and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organisation . 
Trump also mischaracterised the WHO ’s recommendations on travel restrictions , claiming it had strongly resisted his early efforts to ban travel from China . 
In reality , the WHO ’s director general suggested international travel bans were of limited public health benefit and could be counter productive , but did not call for them to be abandoned altogether . 
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that , where restrictions were introduced , they should be limited and proportionate . 
The Trump administration introduced limited restrictions , which came later date than those put in place by many other nations . 
Trump , who was still publicly dismissing the virus as a " hoax " when the WHO raised the global risk to its highest level , alleged that the body had misled the world on the dangers in the early stages , under pressure from Beijing ’s officials , whom he also accused of ignoring their reporting obligations to the WHO .
