The fourth Covid 19 test result for Ohio governor Mike De Wine came back negative on Saturday after he received conflicting positive and negative results two days before , ahead of a scheduled meeting with President Trump , the Associated Press reports . 
On Thursday De Wine was administered a rapid point of care antigen test ahead of a planned meeting with Trump , according to his spokesperson Dan Tierney , which gave a positive result . 
Shortly afterwards he took a polymerase chain reaction test , which is the most commonly used test in the country and is considered the gold standard by medical professionals . 
More than 1.3 million Ohioans have been tested with it . 
The results were checked twice , both negative . 
The conflicting results underscore the problems with both kinds of tests and are bound to spark more questions about their reliability .
