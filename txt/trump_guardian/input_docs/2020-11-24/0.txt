Using blood plasma from Covid 19 survivors to treat patients with severe pneumonia caused by the coronavirus showed little benefit , according to data released from a clinical trial in Argentina . 
The therapy know as convalescent plasma , which delivers antibodies from Covid 19 survivors to infected people , did not significantly improve patients ’ health status or reduce their risk of dying from the disease any better than a placebo , the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found . 
Despite limited evidence of its efficacy , convalescent plasma , which US president Donald Trump touted in August as a " historic breakthrough , " has been frequently given to patients in the US . 
In October , a small study from India suggested convalescent plasma improved symptoms in Covid 19 patients , such as shortness of breath and fatigue , but did not reduce the risk of death or progression to severe disease after 28 days . 
The new Argentine study involved 333 hospitalised patients with severe Covid 19 pneumonia who were randomly assigned to receive convalescent plasma or a placebo . 
After 30 days , researchers found no significant differences in patients ’ symptoms or health . 
The mortality rate was nearly the same at 11 % in the convalescent plasma group and 11.4 % in the placebo group , a difference not deemed statistically significant . 
It is still possible that convalescent plasma might help less sick Covid 19 patients , study leader Dr Ventura Simonovich of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires said , but more studies would be needed and supplies of the treatment are not scalable . 
For patients with severe disease , like the ones in this study , " other therapies based on antibodies could have a role , " he said .
