The company ’s chief executive officer , Stéphane Bancel , told FT that he did not expect to have full approval to distribute the drug to all sections of the US population until next spring . 
Moderna will not be ready to seek emergency use authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration before 25 November at the earliest , the report said , citing Bancel . 
The company ’s experimental vaccine is among the leaders in the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine to tackle the Covid 19 pandemic .

A Covid 19 vaccine has become a divisive issue for the US presidential election and was of significant importance in the presidential debate on Tuesday between president Donald Trump and contender Joe Biden . 
Results from an early safety study of Moderna ’s coronavirus vaccine candidate in older adults on Tuesday showed that it produced virus neutralising antibodies at levels similar to those seen in younger adults .
