The US Food & amp ; 
Drug Administration ( FDA ) said it has authorised the use of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from Covid 19 as a treatment for the disease , a day after President Donald Trump blamed the agency for impeding the rollout of coronavirus vaccines for political reasons . 
The announcement from the FDA of a so called " emergency use authorisation " comes as Trump has announced a news briefing for today where he is likely to make an announcement on the topic . 
The FDA early evidence suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients when administered in the first three days of their hospitalisation . 
It was not immediately clear what the immediate impact of this decision would be . 
Patients who benefited the most from this treatment are those under 80 years old and who were not on a respirator , the agency said . 
Such patients had a 35 percent better survival rate a month after receiving the treatment . 
" It appeared that the product is safe and we ’re comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals , " said Peter Marks , director of the Food and Drug Administration ’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , on a conference call with reporters . 
The agency also said it determined this was a safe approach in an analysis of 20,000 patients who received this treatment . 
So far , 70,000 patients have been treated using blood plasma .
