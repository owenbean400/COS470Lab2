The US Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors against prescribing the malaria drug Donald Trump has been touting , citing reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among patients . 
From the Associated Press : The warning comes as doctors at a New York hospital published a report that heart rhythm abnormalities developed in most of 84 coronavirus patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin , a combo Trump has promoted . 
Both drugs are known to sometimes alter the heartbeat in dangerous ways , and their safety or ability to help people with COVID 19 is unknown . 
The warning excludes in hospital and research studies . 
A National Institutes of Health experts panel earlier this week also recommended against taking that drug combo except in a formal study .
