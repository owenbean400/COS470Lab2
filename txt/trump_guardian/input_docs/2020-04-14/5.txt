Fact check : Travel restrictions Trump has repeatedly touted his travel restrictions as evidence that he reacted early to the coronavirus threat . 
We ’ve addressed this several times on the liveblog over the past few weeks , but here we go again ... 
The administration ’s travel policy did not " cut off " all travel from China , as Trump calims . 
Although non US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks , American citizens , permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt . 
Similarly , Trump ’s European travel restrictions exempted citizens , residents and their families . 
And initially , the restrictions did not apply to the UK and Ireland , as well as most Eastern European countries . 
Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact , as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US .
