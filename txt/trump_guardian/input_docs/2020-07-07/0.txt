The United States will leave the World Health Organization on 6 July 2021 , the United Nations has said after receiving formal notification of the decision from Washington . 
The US president Donald Trump had to give one year ’s notice of for withdrawal from the Geneva based UN agency under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress , which also obliges Washington to pay financial support . 
The United States currently owes the WHO more than $ 200m ( approximately £ 160m ) in assessed contributions , according to the WHO website . 
After more than 70 years of membership , the United States moved to quit the WHO after Trump accused it of becoming a puppet of China amid the pandemic . 
The virus first emerged in China ’s Wuhan city late last year . 
Stéphane Dujarric , a UN spokesman , said : The secretary general ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met . 
Trump had halted US funding for the 194 member organisation in April , then demanded a series of reforms on 18 May , before announcing the decision to pull the US out less than two weeks later . 
The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations . 
The UN s Secretary general António Guterres has said the WHO is " absolutely critical to the world ’s efforts to win the war against Covid 19 " . 
Trump has long scorned multilateralism as he focuses on an " America First " agenda . 
Since taking office , he has quit the UN Human Rights Council , the UN cultural agency , a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal . 
He has also cut funding for the UN population fund and the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees .
