In Washington , Trump has ended his briefing on a sour note . 
Asked by CBS White House Correspondent Weijia Jiang why he is fixated on comparing the US ’s testing capability with other countries as opposed to focusing on the lag that still exists in the US , Trump replied : " Maybe that ’s a question you should ask China . 
Do not ask me , ask China that question , OK ? " 
He then called on CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins , who ceded the mic to Jiang so she could ask her follow up . 
Jiang , who is Asian American , replied to Trump : " Sir , why are you saying that to me , specifically , that I should ask China . " 
" I ’m telling you , I ’m not saying it specifically to anybody . 
I ’m saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that , " he said . 
Collins then tried to ask her question but Trump skipped her . 
He then refused to take any more questions and left the podium .
