Asked why he did not take the virus seriously in the early phases of its spread in the US , the president repeated his claims about that his travel restrictions against China made a difference and saved many lives : " People should say I acted very early . " 
In fact , the administration ’s travel policy did not cut off all travel from China . 
Although non US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks , American citizens , permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt . 
Similarly , Trump ’s European travel restrictions exempted citizens , residents and their families . 
And initially , the restrictions did not apply to the UK and Ireland , as well as most Eastern European countries . 
Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact , as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US .
