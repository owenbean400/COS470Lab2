The US president Donald Trump has no basis for claiming success battling the country ’s coronavirus crisis , the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said on Monday , saying his policies had endangered Americans . 
He should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he had such good policies , because in fact he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country . 
Pelosi said she hoped Monday ’s decision to release Trump from his hospital stay for the virus came from his doctors . 
A bit later , the doctors said he would have good medical care at the White House . 
Pelosi told MSNBC that Trump could be a " long hauler , " someone who experiences longer term consequences . 
She said the testing protocol at the White House , where several of Trump ’s aides have also fallen ill , " apparently ... does not work . " 
Before he was due to leave the hospital on Monday , Trump urged people not to be afraid of the disease , which has killed more than a million people worldwide and wreaked economic and social havoc . 
" Do not be afraid of Covid . 
Don*t let it dominate your life . 
We have developed , under the Trump Administration , some really great drugs & amp ; knowledge . 
I feel better than I did 20 years ago ! " he tweeted . 
Trump was eager to get out , a source familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier on Monday . 
His doctor said the president " may not entirely be out of the woods yet . " 
Pelosi said she tested negative on Friday . 
Her spokesman said her test on Monday also was negative . 
" We will do what we need to do to protect the members of Congress , " Pelosi told MSNBC , but she did not announce any new testing protocols . 
Most of the people in our world who have come into contact and have been , tested positive , did not get the virus at the Capitol . 
It was in other encounters , including at the White House .
