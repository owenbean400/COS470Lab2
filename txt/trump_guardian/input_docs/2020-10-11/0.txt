Twitter has flagged a tweet by Donald Trump suggesting he has coronavirus immunity as misleading . 
The disclaimer said the tweet violated its policies about misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid 19 . 
" A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday . 
That means I ca not get it ( immune ) , and ca not give it . 
Very nice to know , " Trump said in the tweet . 
A Twitter spokeswoman told Reuters that the tweet made " misleading health claims " about Covid 19 and that engagements with the post would be " significantly limited , " as is standard in such cases .
