The president said that he ’ll decide by the end of the week whether the US will continue to fund the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
The international body has been a frequent scapegoat for Trump , who blames WHO officials for the severity of the pandemic . 
He also referred to the WHO and the World Trade Organization as the Bobbsey Twins , characters from children ’s books first published in 1904 . 
My long dead grandfather called and wants his " Bobbsey Twins " reference back . 
President Trump was just denouncing the corrupt ( WHO ) World Health Org . 
& amp ; 
( WTO ) World Trade Org for constantly " ripping off the U.S . " and said " they 're like the Bobbsey Twins . " 
If you do not find that characterization highly entertaining , I 'm not sure we can be friends anymore . 
Trump says he calls the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization the " Bobbsey Twins , " and I had to look that up which made me feel young ;)
