Trump is addressing the press flanked by Mike Pence , the vice president he put in charge of coronavirus response efforts to not universal acclaim , and federal health officials . 
It ’s a long preamble on Afghanistan , in which Trump said he would personally meet Taliban leaders soon and said the US could yet go back in " with a force like nobody ’s ever seen " . 
So much for that . 
The coronavirus outbreak is very important to many people , Trump says , paying tribute to the officials with him and others in a more than usually husky voice . 
A lot of progress has been made , he says , and he will update us here . 
Remember , the first US death was confirmed just before he came out . 
There are 22 patients in the US – the president says one person died overnight and it was a woman in her late 50s . 
Washington state governor Jay Inslee just announced it was a man .
