Trump said he would deploy the military if governors failed to sufficiently deploy national guard members , but that he was immediately deploying the military in Washington DC . 
Our country always wins . 
That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America . 
First we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country . 
We will end it now . 
Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets . 
Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled . 
If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents , then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them . 
I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital - Washington DC . 
What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace . 
As we speak , I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers , military personnel , and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting , looting , vandalism , assaults , and the wanton destruction of property . 
We are putting everybody on warning - a 7:00 curfew will be strictly enforced . 
Those who threaten innocent lives and property , will be arrested , detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . 
I want the organisers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail . 
This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence .
