My colleagues on our US live blog also report that Anthony Fauci , the government ’s top public health expert and Covid 19 task force member , said he was no longer in frequent contact with the president . 
Asked whether the president talks to him often about Covid vaccine work , he told a reporter with Stat News , " No ... 
As you probably noticed , that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately . 
And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased . " 
Fauci noted that they used to have task force meetings daily , including on the weekend , and said that frequently , the two would talk after the meeting , estimating that a month ago , they met four times a week . 
Fauci , the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases , also told a CNN reporter that he has not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks and that their last interaction was 18 May , during a teleconference with the nation ’s governors .
