The US president Donald Trump has asked Americans to wear masks " whether you like the mask or not " , despite repeatedly downplaying the importance of wearing masks and refusing to wear one on many occasions . 
The president was first seen wearing a mask publicly earlier this month . 
At a White House press briefing , he has noted a " concerning rise " in cases in parts of the South , in a complete shift from his previous strategy - refusing to acknowledge that there is a problem . 
He stayed uncharacteristically on message , saying the government is " asking Americans to use masks , socially distance and employ vigorous hygiene â€“ wash your hands every chance you get " . 
He also asked younger people to " avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings . "
