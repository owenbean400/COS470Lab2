Hi , this is Helen Sullivan taking over the blog from my colleague Kevin Rawlinson . 
US president Donald Trump is still addressing reporters at the White House , which means we are hard at work fact checking . 
Trump was asked when the US will catch up with South Korea and other countries in terms of testing per capital . 
" It â€™s very much on par , " Trump says of the US testing numbers . 
So , Is testing in the US on par with other countries ? 
My colleague Adam Gabbatt answers this one : " The US , as of Monday afternoon , had conducted about 287 tests per 100,000 people in the US ( with huge variations depending on the county , city and state ) . 
This compares to 709 per 100,000 in South Korea and 600 per 100,000 in Italy . "
