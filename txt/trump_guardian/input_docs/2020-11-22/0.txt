US president elect Joe Biden will have a scaled down version inauguration due to the coronavirus pandemic , the incoming White House chief of staff has said . 
Ron Klain said : " I think it ’s going to definitely have to be changed ... 
Obviously , this is not going to be the same kind of inauguration we had in the past . " 
Its worth remembering here that Donald Trump , the outgoing president , had something akin to a scaled down inauguration in 2017 due to remarkably low attendance , though his then press secretary Sean Spicer falsely claimed it was " the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration , period , both in person and around the globe " . 
Presidential inaugurations traditionally featur a swearing in and speech by the new president before crowds backed onto the national mall , as well as lunch with lawmakers and a parade to the White House . 
Biden ’s team is consulting with leaders in the House of Representatives and Senate on details and best practices , said Klain . 
The result will likely be a " scaled down versions of the existing traditions , " he told ABC."We know people want to celebrate . 
There is something here to celebrate . 
We just want to try to find a way to do it as safely as possible . "
