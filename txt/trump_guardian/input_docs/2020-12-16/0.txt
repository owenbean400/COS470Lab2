US hospitals have been slow to embrace Covid 19 antibody drugs from Eli Lilly and Regeneron that have been authorised to reduce the risk of hospitalisation , US officials said . 
Demand for the therapies , which are given as a one time intravenous infusion , has been " disappointing , " and hospitals should be using them more , Operation Warp Speed chief advisor Dr Moncef Slaoui said . 
The government programme is distributing and allocating the drugs . 
Health systems say they have been slow to ramp up use of the antibody drugs due to extra levels of complexity during the pandemic - including requirements for quick diagnosis times and the need to isolate infectious patients . 
The US Department of Health and Human Services has so far delivered over 250,000 doses of Lilly ’s bamlanivimab and Regeneron ’s antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab to states and territories . 
Both treatments have US emergency use authorisation for non hospitalised Covid 19 patients at risk of becoming severely ill due to age or underlying health conditions . 
The drugs are monoclonal antibodies , known as MAbs in medical shorthand , manufactured copies of proteins produced by the body to fight coronavirus infection . 
The Regeneron cocktail was among the medicines used to treat US president Donald Trump when he contracted Covid 19 . 
Despite emergency use authorisations for both antibody drugs , the National Institutes of Health and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend against their routine use , saying the benefits are uncertain .
