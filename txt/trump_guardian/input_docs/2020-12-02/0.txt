Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain unable to reach agreement on fresh relief for a pandemic hit US economy , with top Republicans supporting what the Senate ’s top Democrats dismissed as an " inadequate , partisan proposal " . 
Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said outgoing president Donald Trump supported a proposal put forth by Republican majority leader Mitch Mc Connell , after Mc Connell on Tuesday rejected a $ 908bn bipartisan package . 
Mc Connell ’s outline is very close to the legislation that the Senate leader has been touting for months and was rejected by Democrats , according to one Senate Republican source . 
The plan includes $ 332.7bn in new loans or grants to small businesses , according to a document provided to Reuters . 
" The president will sign the Mc Connell proposal that he put forward yesterday . 
We look forward to making progress on that , " Mnuchin said . 
But the Senate Democratic leader , Chuck Schumer , blasted the Republican effort for excluding Democrats , who control the US House of Representatives . 
In a speech on the Senate floor , he said : The Republican leader should not waste the Senate ’s time on another inadequate , partisan proposal and instead should sit down with Democrats to begin a true bipartisan effort to quickly meet the needs of the country . 
He noted the Mc Connell proposal includes liability protection for businesses that Democrats reject . 
Adding to the pressure , the two parties face a 11 December deadline to pass a $ 1.4tn budget or risk a shutdown of the government as the Covid 19 crisis worsens across the US .
