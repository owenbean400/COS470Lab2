The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said the number of Covid 19 cases in the US may be 10 times higher than reported . 
By those measures , an estimated 20 million Americans have been infected by the virus , compared to the official number of 2.45 million infected . 
The CDC released the new estimate based on testing for antibodies across the country . 
" Our best estimate right now is that for every case that ’s reported , there actually are 10 other infections , " CDC director Dr Robert Redfield said on a call with reporters Thursday . 
That ’s because many cases of the illness come with no symptoms , Redfield noted . 
That does not undermine how dangerous the disease is , he noted . 
On Thursday , the CDC also expanded its list of who is at greatest risk of Covid 19 complications , removing the age cutoff of 65 . 
" There ’s not an exact cutoff of age at which people should or should not be concerned , " Jay Butler of the CDC said . 
Meanwhile , vice president Mike Pence and other members of the Trump administration were criticised on Thursday for touring Lordstown Motors , in Lordstown , Ohio , without wearing masks .
