Wyoming has become the 50th , and final , US state to be under a disaster declaration following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday . 
That means for for the first time in history every US state is under a disaster declaration . 
The US Virgin islands , the Northern Mariana Islands , the District of Columbia , Guam and Puerto Rico are also under disaster declarations , which allow federal funds to be used by state and local governments during the pandemic . 
" Though Wyoming has not reached the dire situations of some states , this declaration will help us to prepare and mobilize resources when we need them , " said Wyoming â€™s governor , Mark Gordon , in a statement after requesting the declaration earlier this week . 
There have been 253 confirmed cases of Covid 19 in Wyoming to date . 
Wyoming is the least populated state in the US . 
So far there have been no deaths from Covid 19 among its 578,000 residents .
