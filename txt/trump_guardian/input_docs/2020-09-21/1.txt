Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has slammed US president Donald Trump ’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic , saying the Republican " froze " when faced with the enormous challenge posed by the health crisis . 
With US deaths from Covid 19 approaching 200,000 , Biden said on a campaign stop in Wisconsin that Trump had fallen short of the level of presidential leadership required to contend with the pandemic ’s spread . 
" He just was not up to it . 
He froze . 
He failed to act . 
He panicked , " Biden told workers at an aluminum manufacturing plant in Manitowoc , south of Green Bay . 
Trump will also campaign on Monday in the Midwest , where Biden is highlighting the faltering post pandemic economy as he tries to reclaim a handful of key states that backed Trump in 2016 . 
Trump will hold events in Ohio . 
In Wisconsin , Biden said Trump could have saved lives with a mask mandate but continued to hold rallies without social distancing or people wearing masks , and worried too much about spooking financial markets . 
" Frankly , I ’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life ... guys who think they ’re better than you , ’ Biden said . 
" I do not like guys like this . " 
Trump visited Wisconsin last week , announcing a new round of coronavirus pandemic assistance to farmers of about $ 13bn .
