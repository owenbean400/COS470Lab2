A federal judge in Nevada has dismissed a lawsuit by president Donald Trump ’s re election campaign that sought to block the state from sending mail in ballots to every registered voter there , a legal victory for Democrats ahead of November ’s election . 
The order is the latest in a string of wins for Democrats in battleground states , including in Michigan and Pennsylvania , where courts this month ruled that mailed ballots that arrive within certain time periods after the 3 November election day must still be counted . 
Trump ’s campaign had argued that the Nevada law , which includes provisions mandating that ballots received up to three days after 3 November be counted even if they lack a postmark , would lead to election fraud . 
Experts say election fraud is exceedingly rare in the US , but Trump , facing off against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , has repeatedly said without evidence that an expected surge in voting by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a " rigged " election . 
In an order dated Friday but released on Monday , US district judge James Mahan dismissed the case , saying the campaign does not represent Nevada voters , and did not have legal standing to bring the complaint , which he called " impermissibly generalised . " 
" Not only have plaintiffs failed to allege a substantial risk of voter fraud , the State of Nevada has its own mechanisms for deterring and prosecuting voter fraud , " he wrote , adding that the alleged injuries were " speculative . " 
Marc Elias , an elections lawyer working with Biden ’s campaign , said on Twitter that the ruling was a " big victory " for Democrats . 
Nevada is among eight states that plan to mail every voter a ballot . 
Election officials in most states have encouraged at home voting as the highly contagious nature of Covid 19 has made voting in person a concern .
