Trump is now getting a question about why he did not warn Americans about the virus earlier . 
Trump responds by asking the reporter which network she is from ( CBS ) . 
She follows up her question and he tells her to " relax " . 
He does not answer and goes to his stock answer that he put a ban on flights from China in the end of January . 
He ’s getting quite angry now . 
In a back and forth with the reporter , Trump tells her to " keep your voice down " . 
Now he is shouting at her and telling her she should say to him " thank you very much for ( my ) good judgement " . 
Another female reporter is asking a question now . 
He talks over her and it ’s hard to hear her question .
