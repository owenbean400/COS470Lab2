The US Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) has treated 1,300 coronavirus patients with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine , which a study has tied to an increased risk of death . 
The Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer , who received the information from the VA in response to questions he submitted on the issue , said he was " deeply troubled " by the data . 
The US president Donald Trump has urged use of hydroxychloroquine against the virus and recently said he has been taking it himself , despite evidence that the treatment could be harmful . 
A study published on Friday in the medical journal Lancet tied the drug to an increased risk of death in hospitalised patients with Covid 19 .
