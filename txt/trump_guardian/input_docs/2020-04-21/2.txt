In today ’s White House press briefing Trump said the US has " tested more than any country in the world , even put together . " 
This is false . 
Overall , the US had administered more than 4.5m coronavirus tests , according to the Covid Tracking Project . 
From a very slow start , the US , with a population of 329m , had ramped up to a testing rate of one in every 100 people — similar to South Korea . 
Germany has done even better , testing every 1 in 63 people . 
The UK , however , is behind , having tested only 1 in 230 people . 
In America , despite the recent increase in testing , backlogs are reported in labs across the country , and many people with symptoms — including health workers — are still struggling to access tests
