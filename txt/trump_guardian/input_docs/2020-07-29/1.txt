Texas Representative Louie Gohmert has tested positive for Covid 19 , forcing him to abruptly cancel his plan to travel to his home state with president Donald Trump . 
The Republican immediately faced criticism from colleagues for shunning masks on Capitol Hill , where face coverings are not mandatory and testing is sparse . 
66 year old Gohmert , one of the House ’s most conservative and outspoken members , told a Texas news station that he tested positive at the White House and planned to self quarantine . 
He is at least the 10th member of Congress known to have tested positive for the coronavirus . 
The congressman ’s positive test raised further questions about the lack of mask and testing requirements in the Capitol as members frequently fly back and forth from their hometowns and gather for votes , hearings and news conferences . 
Several GOP senators said they were pushing for more regular testing in the Capitol . 
Republican Missouri senator Roy Blunt , chairman of the Senate Rules Committee , said : I think particularly for members of Congress who are going back and forth , they represent the perfect petri dish for how you spread a disease . 
You send 535 people out to 535 different locations , on about 1,000 different airplanes , and bring them back and see what happens . 
It seems to me theres a better path forward . 
House speaker Nancy Pelosi has tried to encourage mask use , and committees have rules requiring the wearing of face coverings in hearing rooms . 
But there ’s no mandate for lawmakers to wear masks in hallways or while voting on the floor , and no mechanism for enforcement . 
Gohmert , who has questioned mask use for months , also went as far as to say that wearing a mask may have been how he contracted the virus . 
Medical experts say masks are one of the best ways to prevent transmission of the virus , which is thought to mainly spread through people who are in close contact .
