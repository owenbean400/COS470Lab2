A challenge laid down to US President Donald Trump . 
Since President Trump claims he can force the FDA to approve a vaccine and ignore its own safety rules , I 'm asking him whether he 'll commit to vaccinating himself and each member of his family before November 3rd with any COVID 19 vaccine approved by the FDA before election day .
