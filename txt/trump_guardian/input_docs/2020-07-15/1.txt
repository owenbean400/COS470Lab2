Brazil has suffered 1,233 more deaths and registered 39,924 new cases , its health ministry has said . 
The country has now recorded a total off 75,366 deaths and confirmed 1,996,748 cases in all , making it the world ’s second worst affected . 
As the figures were released , the far right president , who has repeatedly dismissed the dangers posed by the pandemic , publicly acknowledged a second positive test that suggests he has not recovered . 
Bolsonaro told reporters he would get tested again in a few days . 
He continued to play down the country ’s mounting death toll and said his good physical condition would prevent him from developing serious symptoms if he got ill . 
Bolsonaro has also sidelined medical experts in Brazil ’s handling of the pandemic , pushed back against state and city lockdowns and circulated often in public without a mask , drawing criticism from public health specialists . 
He has also said he was taking the anti malarial drug hydroxychloroquine , an unproven Covid 19 treatment that he and Trump have touted as a remedy . 
Bolsonaro ’s pressure to use the drug alienated two health ministers who resigned in the middle of the pandemic . 
The ministry is being led on an interim basis by an active duty army general .
