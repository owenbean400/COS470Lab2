Fact check : ventilators My San Franciscan colleague Maanvi Singh has a fact check on that Trump claim regarding where things stand with ventilators . 
It looks like we ’re in great shape from the bed standpoint . 
It looks like we ’re in great shape from the ventilators standpoint , " Trump said . 
However , an article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid 19 in the coming months . 
The authors , American public health experts , wrote : ‘ There is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for US patients with Covid 19 , from several hundred thousand to as many as a million . 
The estimates vary depending on the number , speed , and severity of infections , of course , but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed ... . current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000 , depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included . 
The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap . 
No matter which estimate we use , there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid 19 in the upcoming months . "
