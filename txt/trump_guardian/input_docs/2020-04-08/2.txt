Trump has just been asked by a reporter : " When are we going to open up ? " referring to the economy . 
Trump says he does not want to give a date . 
" I had a date . 
It was very aspirational – Easter . " 
Trump said Easter might still be a good date after all , but for flattening the curve . 
He said the government is no longer receiving new requests for ventilators , and that he ’d like to be able to lend ventilators to US allies – and non allies , he adds , because " we ’re saving lives . " 
Trump has now left the podium . 
Pence says that the losses of life that are being seen today are in many cases people who contracted the virus before strict measures and other aspects of the response came into effect . 
But in new cases there is great progress , says Pence . 
" We continue to evidence of stabilisation . " 
" We may – may – be reaching the point where the coronavirus is levelling off , " says Pence .
