Top Democrats in the US Congress today urged renewed negotiations over a multitrillion dollar coronavirus aid proposal , but the top Republican immediately rejected their approach as too expensive , continuing a months long impasse . 
The House of Representatives speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and Senate Democratic leader , Chuck Schumer , ticked off a litany of grim data about the spread of the coronavirus in the US , with eight straight days of over 100,000 new coronavirus cases being reported each day . 
" It ’s like the house is burning down and they just refuse to throw water on it , " Pelosi said of Republicans . 
She and Schumer told a news conference that President elect Joe Biden ’s victory strengthened the Democratic position , which is to spend at least $ 2.2tn on another round of coronavirus aid , on top of $ 3tn Congress has approved since the pandemic began . 
The Republican president , Donald Trump , has not conceded to Biden . 
" We ’re willing to sit down and talk ; they have not wanted to talk , " Schumer said , referring to the post election session of Congress that lasts until the end of the year . 
The Senate majority leader , Mitch Mc Connell , speaking to reporters in a hallway a few minutes later , said he preferred previous Republican proposals in the range of $ 500bn . 
" I gather she [ Pelosi ] and the Democratic leader in the Senate still are looking at something dramatically larger . 
That ’s not a place I think we ’re willing to go , " Mc Connell said . 
" But I do think there needs to be another package , " the Republican said . 
" Hopefully we can get past the impasse . " 
In May , the Democratic majority House approved an additional $ 3.4tn in coronavirus aid , but it went nowhere in Mc Connell ’s Senate , where Schumer ’s Democrats blocked less expensive Republican proposals .
