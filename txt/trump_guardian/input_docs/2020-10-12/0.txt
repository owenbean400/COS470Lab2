Top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci said on Monday that the president Donald Trump ’s campaign team should take down an advertisement that draws on a public statement Fauci made that he says is being used out of context . 
Asked in an interview on CNN if the ad should be removed , Fauci said , " I think so . " 
He said the ad was " unfortunate and really disappointing . " 
The ad , released last week , discusses Trump ’s efforts to recover from Covid 19 , as well as his administration ’s work to address the coronavirus pandemic . 
The 30 second spot uses older remarks from Fauci in a way that suggests he was praising the president .
