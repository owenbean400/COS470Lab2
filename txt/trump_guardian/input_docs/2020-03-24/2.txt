Trump evaded a question about why he ’s fixated on easing back distancing measures by Easter . 
" I just thought it was a beautiful time " he said . 
But he said he ’ll " be guided very much by Dr Fauci " and Dr Deborah Birx . 
" Maybe we do sections of the country , " Trump said . 
Fauci said timeline of when the US should ease physical distancing measures is " really very flexible " . 
He said people " can look at a date but you have to be very flexible " . 
Fauci once again emphasised the need for data to inform public health policies .
