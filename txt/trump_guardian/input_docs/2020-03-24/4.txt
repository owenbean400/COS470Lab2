The Australian market rose 5.81 % at the opening bell on Wednesday , following extraordinary gains of as much as 11 % on US markets overnight . 
With markets extremely volatile , it ’s become something of mug ’s game to try to explain the latest gyrations . 
While some analysts put the US market ’s increase down to hopes a long awaited stimulus package was close to being approved by congress , a more likely - if grimmer - explanation is that traders have reacted with glee to talk from Donald Trump that he might soon lift coronavirus restrictions . 
This would cost many lives but get cash moving in the economy again . 
On the Australian bourse , the biggest gainer at the open was debt collector Credit Corp , which was up 39 % - a second day of big gains - and the biggest loser was funeral home operator Invocare , which told the market it would be hit by new restrictions limiting the number of people at funerals to 10 .
