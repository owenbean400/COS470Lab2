In Washington , both Trump and Pence indicated in that press briefing that the Defence Production Act ( DPA ) would not be invoked to compel private companies to produce masks , ventilators and other vital supplies . 
But their comments appeared to contradict what Peter Gaynor , the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , said earlier today . 
This morning , Gaynor told CNN that his agency was " going to use the DPA for the first time today " . 
A FEMA spokesperson said minutes later that the act had indeed not been needed . 
UPDATE : FEMA spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow tells me " at the last minute we were able to procure the test kits from the private market , " meaning no DPA after all . 
FEMA administrator Gaynor told CNN this morning the agency was utilizing the wartime production act . 
Last week , Trump issued an executive order invoking that the 1950 law , so the government could ask companies to prioritize the production of crucial medical supplies . 
Ever since , the administration has undermined the need for such measures arguing that companies are voluntarily stepping up to make necessary products , and ordering companies do this work would have amounted to socialism .
