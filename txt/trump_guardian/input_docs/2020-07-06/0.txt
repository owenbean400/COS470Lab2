New York ’s governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday called on Donald Trump to not be a " co conspirator " of the coronavirus and acknowledge the " major problem " it poses as cases spiked in dozens of states after some rushed to reopen , Reuters reports . 
The number of US coronavirus deaths exceeded 130,000 on Monday ( see 3.59pm . ) , following a massive surge of new cases that has put Trump ’s handling of the crisis under the microscope and derailed efforts to restart the economy . 
" So , Mr . President , do not be a co conspirator of Covid , " Cuomo said at a news briefing . 
Acknowledge to the American people that Covid exists , it is a major problem , it ’s going to continue until we admit it and each of us stands up to do our part . 
Cuomo said the president was " enabling " the virus if he failed to acknowledge the severity of the situation , and slammed the president ’s comments that the surge in US cases was due to increased testing . 
" He makes up facts . 
He makes up science , " Cuomo said , citing several past Trump statements on the virus such it would disappear like a miracle as the weather got warmer . 
He said all those things , none of them were true . 
And now we have a problem in 38 states because some people believe him . 
Cuomo said coronavirus hospitalisations in New York dropped to 817 - the lowest since 18 March - and nine people died from Covid 19 on Sunday , adding : The numbers have actually declined since we started reopening . 
Cuomo warned about complacency now that the worst seemed to be over in New York , pointing to reports of some July Fourth celebrations , including in Manhattan and on Fire Island and upstate , where revellers ignored social distancing and face covering rules . 
He said : That curve was purely a function of what we did . 
If we change what we ’re doing , you ’re going to change the trajectory of the virus .
