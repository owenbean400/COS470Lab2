Jair Bolsonaro , the far right president of Brazil , is suffering Covid 19 symptoms and is awaiting the results of a test , according to CNN Brasil . 
Bolsonaro , who has previously tested negative after people close to him were infected , has repeatedly dismissed the risks posed by the virus , even as his country â€™s suffering increased . 
Brazil is the second worst hit nation in the world after the US , whose own rightwing president Donald Trump has also sought to play down the dangers posed by the pandemic .
