The US â€™s top infectious disease expert has testified before Congress that the country will be doing more Covid 19 testing , not less , hours after Donald Trump insisted he was serious when he called for testing to slowdown in the US . 
Coronavirus cases have continued to rise in about half of US states , but Trump said at a weekend rally in Tulsa , Oklahoma , that increased testing was making the US look bad and that he had asked staff to slow down . 
# His press secretary had later said the remarks were " in jest " but the president stood by them on Tuesday , telling reporters that the comments were not a joke . 
Speaking to a congressional committee hours later , however , Dr Anthony Fauci said : I know for sure that to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing . 
That just is a fact . 
In fact , we will be doing more testing .
