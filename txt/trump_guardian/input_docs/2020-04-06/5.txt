The Guardian â€™s David Smith asked Trump about Boris Johnson and whether the UK PM had been wrong about his earlier relaxed attitude to social distancing . 
Trump said : Boris was looking at it differently . 
He was looking at it earlier . 
He was looking at it like : ride it out . 
There were many people thinking about riding it out . 
Meaning , you know , whatever it is , it is . 
But then you see what starts to happen then the numbers become monumental , and they decided not to do that .
