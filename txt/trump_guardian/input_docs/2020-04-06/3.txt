Back to Trump ’s briefing , where the president is now taking questions . 
First up about Boris Johnson . 
He says : " I found Boris to be a fantastic person , a fantastic warm strong smart guy . 
He loves his country , you see that . 
He fought like hell for his country . 
But intensive care is big stuff , really big stuff ... " 
When asked about the news of the UK prime minister meant the White House would reconsider its own safety procedures , Trump said : " Mike had his test ... 
I had my test ... 
We ’re here and here you are . " 
He said because of " questions like that " , the White House will probably do more tests , which he said are so " quick and easy " .
