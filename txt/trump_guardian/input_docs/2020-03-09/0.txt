The coronavirus crisis has edged closer to the Oval Office after it emerged that Florida congressman Mark Gaetz , who travelled with Donald Trump on Air Force One from his state to Washington on Monday , is now in self isolation . 
He took the action after it emerged that he was one of several Republican lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month ’s Conservative Political Action Conference who tested positive for the virus . 
The president meanwhile continued to play down the impact of the virus and again compared it with the common flu . 
So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu . 
It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year . 
Nothing is shut down , life & amp ; the economy go on . 
At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of Corona Virus , with 22 deaths . 
Think about that !
