Joe Biden has argued that President Trump deserved no credit for the US jobs report which showed unemployment had dropped slightly to 13.3 % from 14.7 % a month earlier . 
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Trump had still failed to acknowledge how his response to the coronavirus pandemic had hampered the country ’s economy . 
" He has no idea the depth of the pain that so many people are still enduring . 
He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference , " the former vice president said . 
" It ’s time for him to step out of his own bunker , take a look around the consequences of his words and his actions . " 
Biden added : " Let ’s be clear : a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of American their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return . "
