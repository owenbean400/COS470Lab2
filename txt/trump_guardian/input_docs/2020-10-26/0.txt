The World Health Organization chief has warned abandoning efforts to control the coronavirus pandemic , as suggested by a top US official , was " dangerous " , urging countries not to " give up " . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged that after months of battling Covid 19 , which has claimed more than 1.1 million lives globally , a certain level of " pandemic fatigue " had set in . 
" It ’s tough and the fatigue is real , " Tedros said . 
" But we cannot give up , " he added , urging leaders to " balance the disruption to lives and livelihoods " . 
" When leaders act quickly , the virus can be suppressed . " 
His comment came a day after US president Donald Trump ’s chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN that the administration ’s focus had moved to mitigation , not stamping out the virus . 
" We ’re not going to control the pandemic . 
We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines , therapeutics and other mitigations , " Meadows said , comparing the more deadly Covid 19 to the seasonal flu . 
Asked about Meadows ’ comments , Tedros said he agreed that focusing on mitigation , and especially on protecting the vulnerable , was important . 
" But giving up on control is dangerous , " he insisted . 
Tedros stressed that mitigation and controlling the pandemic were " not contradictory . 
We can do both . "
