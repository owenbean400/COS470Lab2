Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders criticized China for censoring early coverage of the coronavirus outbreak , telling CNN that the global pandemic may have been averted or lessened had journalists had more freedom in the country . 
Strongman leaders around the world are using the coronavirus crisis to stifle journalists , the leading press freedom watchdog warned , as it bemoaned a missed opportunity to highlight the severity of the outbreak in its early days in Wuhan , China . 
" Sometimes we can talk about press freedom in a theoretical way , but this shows the impact can at times be physical . 
It can affect all of our health , " she added . 
Chinese politicians downplayed the severity of the virus in its early weeks , while police targeted " rumormongers " and censors deleted any commentary that questioned the official line . 
Wuhan 's mayor Zhou Xianwang later said he understood the public was " unsatisfied with our information disclosure . 
" Reporting the truth at the earliest possible moment would have allowed the rest of the world to react probably earlier and probably more seriously , " Vincent said . 
" The consequences ( of stifling media freedom ) are actually deadly . " 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday responded to the report , criticizing the group during a daily press briefing , saying that " this organization has always held deep rooted prejudice against China and their so called report is not worth rebutting . "
