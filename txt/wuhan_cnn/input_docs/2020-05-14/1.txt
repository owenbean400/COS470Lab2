Health officials in China said Thursday that they will be stepping up coronavirus testing and screening countrywide amid growing concern of a domestic rebound in cases . 
The announcement comes after both Jilin and Liaoning provinces in the northeast of the country reported new locally transmitted cases this week . 
Earlier on Thursday , Chinese state media reported that the city of Wuhan , ground zero for the Covid 19 pandemic , had begun a " 10 day battle " to test all 11 million of its citizens for coronavirus after the public health authorities identified six locally transmitted cases .
