The United States is concerned about transparency inside the Chinese government on the Wuhan coronavirus , said a senior State Department official Wednesday . 
" I do believe that the concern you see both inside China and internationally is a reflection of what we â€™ve seen in the past . 2003 was SARS , and a number of issues , where the government has been slow to respond out of fear of embarrassment or making things look worse than they are . 
And that reluctance to respond in a rapid manner does not give the global community a secure feeling for this being managed inside China , " the official said . 
However , there have been encouraging signs that China understands the gravity of the problem , the official added , which is particularly important in the lead up to the Spring Festival period , when millions of Chinese travel both at home and abroad . 
The US is in contact with " the folks in Wuhan and the Ambassador in Beijing , " said the official . 
There have been discussions about raising the travel advisory in response to coronavirus but nothing has been formally announced yet , they added .
