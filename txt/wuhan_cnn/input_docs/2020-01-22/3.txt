A man in his 30s who recently returned from Wuhan has been confirmed as the US 's first case of the new strain of the coronavirus . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the diagnosis Tuesday , saying authorities would now begin to step up health screenings at airports for passengers arriving from the Chinese province . 
The patient , who has not been named , is currently in isolation at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett , Washington . 
He returned from Wuhan on January 15 , before health screenings begun , and sought medical care on January 19 after he began to feel unwell . 
US officials are tracking who the man has been in contact with since returning home but John Wiesman , secretary of health for the state of Washington , said that he believed the risk to the public was still " low . "
