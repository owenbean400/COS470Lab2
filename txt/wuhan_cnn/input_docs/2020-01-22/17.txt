The Hong Kong Food and Health Bureau says it has designated two holiday camps as quarantine centers to isolate family members – or close contacts -- of potential patients infected with the Wuhan coronavirus . 
Close contacts are individuals who will be identified as living and working in close proximity of someone infected with the virus . 
While the patient will be admitted to hospital , close contacts will be isolated at these camps . 
There are currently no confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Hong Kong . 
The city ’s Health Secretary , Sophia Chan , says the government will meet on Thursday to decide if more such camps are needed . 
If necessary , these quarantine centers can be activated within a few hours , she added . 
Once identified and inside the camp , each family of confirmed patients would be kept under medical surveillance and each family will be isolated from each other . 
Back in 2003 , Hong Kong had set up similar quarantine camps to curb the spread of SARS .
