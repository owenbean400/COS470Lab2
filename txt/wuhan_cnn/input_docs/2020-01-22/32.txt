Top officials from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) will meet again Thursday to decide whether to declare the Wuhan virus a " public health emergency of international concern . " 
The WHO 's Emergency Committee met Wednesday in Geneva but decided more information was needed to declare the status of the outbreak and what recommendations should be made regarding it , including potential cross border screening , greater surveillance and rolling out treatment programs . 
" There was an excellent discussion during the committee today , but it was also clear that to proceed , we need more information , " said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , WHO director general . 
" The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously , and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence . "
