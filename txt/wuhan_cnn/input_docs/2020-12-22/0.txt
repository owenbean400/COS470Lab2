Taiwan 's outbreak : Taipei 's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been one of the world 's most effective . 
Taiwan has never had to enact strict lockdowns . 
Nor did it resort to drastic restrictions on civil freedoms , like in mainland China . 
Instead , Taiwan 's response focused on speed . 
Taiwanese authorities began screening passengers on direct flights from Wuhan , where the virus was first identified , on December 31 , 2019 -- back when the virus was mostly the subject of rumors and limited reporting . 
Taiwan confirmed its first reported case of the novel coronavirus on Jan . 21 and then banned Wuhan residents from traveling to the island . 
All passengers arriving from mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao were required to undergo screening . 
All this happened before Wuhan itself went into lockdown on Jan . 23 . 
By March , Taiwan banned most foreign nationals from entering the island , apart from diplomats , residents and those with special entry visas .
