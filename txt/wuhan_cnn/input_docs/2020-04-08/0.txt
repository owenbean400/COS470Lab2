China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan , the original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis , as the city reemerges from a deadly outbreak that is now raging across the globe . 
But even as Wuhan reopens its borders after 76 days , some restrictions within the city will remain in place , and officials warn that the threat of further infections remains far from over . 
The metropolis of 11 million , where the coronavirus was first detected in December , had been sealed off from the outside world since January 23 in an unprecedented effort to contain the outbreak . 
What this means for Wuhan : On Wednesday , healthy residents and visitors will finally be allowed to leave Wuhan , the capital of Hubei province , with trains and flights resumed and highway entrances reopened . 
Wuhan 's railway authority estimated more than 55,000 passengers will leave Wuhan by train Wednesday , with about 40 % bound for the Pearl River Delta region , a major manufacturing hub in China , according to state broadcaster CCTV . 
What this means for China : The easing of travel restrictions on Wuhan is the latest milestone in China 's fight against Covid 19 . 
The country reported nearly zero new local infections in recent weeks , leading to similar restrictive measures being lifted for other parts of Hubei province late last month . 
Luo Ping , an epidemic control official in Wuhan , told CCTV Sunday that the lifting of the lockdown marks a " full restart " of the city 's economic and social activities from their previous " suspension . " 
But he warned the city faces an arduous task preventing imported cases and a recurrence of local infections .
