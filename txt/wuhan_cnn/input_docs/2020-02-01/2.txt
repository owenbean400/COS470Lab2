An estimated 75,815 people could be infected with the coronavirus in Wuhan , China -- far higher than reported numbers , said Hong Kong researchers in a study published Friday . 
Using mathematical models , the authors estimated that the number of people affected in Wuhan ranges from 37,304 to 130,330 . 
The estimates could be much higher than the number of confirmed cases because " not everyone who is infected would require or seek medical attention , " said Gabriel Leung , one of the authors of the study . 
It could also be higher because of a delay between when someone gets infected , when they show symptoms , and when a lab is able to confirm results . 
Correction : A previous version of this post contained a map that misattributed the source of provincial coronavirus case totals . 
The data comes from each province ’s health authority , not China ’s National Health Commission .
