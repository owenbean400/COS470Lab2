Chinese cities home to millions of people feel like ghost towns , with people staying home for fear of catching the virus . 
" There ’s 24 million people in Shanghai , and there ’s nobody on the street . 
It ’s kind of spooky , " said Jenna Davidson , a US college student in Shanghai . 
She said her campus cafeterias closed , shops and restaurants closed . 
The US sent a plane to evacuate around 200 citizens from Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , on Wednesday . 
Jarred Evans , one of those evacuated citizens , told CNN what it was like in the city before he was flown out . 
There are now 11,791 confirmed cases in China , and 259 dead , the majority in Hubei province , where Wuhan is the capital .
