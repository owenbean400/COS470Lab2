The UK will withdraw some staff and dependants from the British Embassy and consulates in China , said an updated advisory from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) . 
The staff are being brought back from China as of January 31 . 
" Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain , " said the advisory . 
" In the event that the situation deteriorates further , the ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited . " 
The FCO is urging against all travel to Hubei province , the epicenter of the outbreak . 
The British Consulate in Wuhan , the city where it all started , is closed .
