Hubei Province , home to Wuhan city where the outbreak began , is suspending all marriage license registrations until further notice . 
The suspension will begin on February 3 to prevent the spread of the outbreak , " protect public health , and safeguard public interests , " said the province in a statement on its website . 
It 's just the latest of a series of drastic measures in the province -- in one other city near Wuhan , every household is only allowed one representative to leave the house and buy groceries every other day . 
Nearly 60 million people , mostly in Hubei , are under partial or full lockdown -- this means limited movement in or out of cities and towns , closed roads , and suspended public transit .
