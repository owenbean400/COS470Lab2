The nation â€™s top infectious disease doctor says a study published Thursday night shows people can spread the Wuhan coronavirus before symptoms set in . 
The study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , examined four Germany business associates who became infected through asymptomatic transmission . 
The chain of transmission : It began with a woman in Shanghai whose parents came to visit from Wuhan . 
They were healthy during their visit , but were later diagnosed as having the coronavirus . 
Then , the woman flew from Shanghai to Germany , where she went to workshops and ate meals with German employees . 
She was healthy with no signs of the disease at that point . 
Within eight days , four employees of that company were diagnosed with the coronavirus . 
Some employees had not attended workshops with the woman -- but they spent time with someone who did .
