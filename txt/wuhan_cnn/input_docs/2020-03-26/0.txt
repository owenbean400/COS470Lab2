Back in January , when the coronavirus outbreak was triggering massive lockdowns and dramatic emergency measures in China , artist Chen Xiaotao Momo drew a cartoon that quickly became popular on Chinese social media . 
In the sketch , a bowl of " hot dry noodles " -- signature dish of Wuhan , the city at ground zero of the pandemic -- sits in a hospital bed with a face mask and teary eyes . 
At the window , regional cuisines representing different parts of China hold signs expressing encouragement and support . 
Wuhan was the first Chinese city to go under lockdown . 
Two months later , the worst of the pandemic appears to have passed in mainland China . 
Lockdowns and restrictions are slowly lifting , and provincial alert levels are being cautiously lowered . 
In a new cartoon , published by Chen yesterday , the bowl of noodles is no longer in bed . 
Instead the Wuhan dish waves happily to the crowd of food friends outside the window , which appears to include Sichuan hot pot and southern Chinese dim sum , among others . 
They appear to be cheering , " Hubei restart , " referring to the hard hit province of which Wuhan is the capital . 
The cartoon has circulated widely in the past day -- the hashtag # Hot Dry Noodles Has Woken Up is trending on Weibo , China 's Twitter like platform , with more than 210 million views .
