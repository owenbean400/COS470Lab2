Jho Low , the fugitive businessman at the center of the 1MDB scandal , may be hiding in Wuhan , where the coronavirus outbreak began , according to Malaysian authorities . 
But the officer added , " There was no new information on whether ( Low ) had fled the country following the Covid 19 outbreak . " 
Low , the alleged mastermind of a multibillion dollar corruption scandal that rocked Malaysia , struck a $ 700 million deal with the US government to end a legal case against him in October last year . 
The US Department of Justice previously claimed that $ 4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB by senior officials -- including Low -- and pumped into New York condos , hotels , yachts and a jet , and used to fund movies such as Leonardo Di Caprio vehicle " The Wolf of Wall Street , " and expensive gifts for Low 's friends , including heiress Paris Hilton . 
The scandal helped bring down former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak , who was also hit with dozens of corruption related charges in the case . 
His trial in Malaysia is ongoing , and he has pleaded not guilty . 
Low has been identified by some as the alleged mastermind of the embezzlement , a charge he has strongly denied . 
He remains wanted by the authorities in Malaysia . 
Abdul Hamid said that he has asked the Kuala Lumpur International Airport " to be alert should he return . " 
He added that should Low have become infected with the coronavirus then his best option would be return to Malaysia .
