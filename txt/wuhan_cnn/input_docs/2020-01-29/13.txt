Around 240 Americans evacuated from Wuhan , China , will be flown to a military base near Riverside County , California , instead of a nearby civilian airport as first planned . 
The flight departed Wuhan about six hours ago , and will land late Tuesday night local time in Anchorage , Alaska , to refuel . 
Passengers will undergo health screenings there to ensure they are not experiencing novel coronavirus symptoms before traveling on to California , Alaska officials said . 
The plane will land at March Air Reserve Base instead of its original destination of California 's Ontario International Airport , said San Bernardino County Commissioner Curt Hagman . 
In a video statement , Hagman said he was informed of the change in plans on Tuesday night . 
No reason was immediately given for the change in itinerary .
