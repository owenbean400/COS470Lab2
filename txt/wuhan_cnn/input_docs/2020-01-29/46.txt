Earlier today , a flight carrying Americans evacuated from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak landed at March Air Reserve Base in southern California . 
Darby Siebels was on it . 
She said she was told by a US Embassy in Beijing representative last night that she had a seat , but she had to find a way to get to the airport when travel inside Wuhan is severely limited by travel restrictions put in place by the Chinese government to stop the spread of the coronavirus . 
En route to the airport , she was stopped at two checkpoints : the first checkpoint they were taking the temperature of some driversâ€”her driver was not stopped or checked ; the second checkpoint stopped them to check if the people in the vehicle were on a manifest of " accepted passengers . " 
At the airport , there was a manifest check , more temperature checks and paperwork . 
" I was probably in the airport for about 9-10 hours before we actually took off , " she said . 
Once on the plane , " everyone was in a pretty calm mood , " she said . 
Two men in what Siebels describes as " full hazmat garb " were walking through the plane giving passengers information . 
They also tried to boost morale , including getting an exit row of the plane to do the wave .
