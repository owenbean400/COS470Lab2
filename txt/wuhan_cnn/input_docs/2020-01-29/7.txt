Two Japanese evacuees who arrived in Tokyo Wednesday morning on a flight from Wuhan said they are relieved to be home . 
Speaking at a press conference after they landed , Takeo Aoyama and Takayuki Kato , both board members of the Japan Chamber of Commerce in Wuhan , said the situation in the city -- which is ground zero for the outbreak -- is rapidly deteriorating , and while they can still access food and other necessities , they cannot freely shop and work . 
Both evacuees urged support for the Chinese people in Wuhan and spoke of their Chinese colleagues and other citizens who stayed behind . 
The two were among 206 Japanese nationals who arrived on a chartered flight operated by ANA , according to Japanese officials . 
The passengers are all quarantined on board and those with any pneumonia like symptoms will be taken to a special medical center for treatment . 
Passengers without symptoms will be taken to separate hospitals for further screening . 
Japanese citizens who live close to the Huanan Seafood Market and highly populated areas in Wuhan , were given priority on first flight . 
Chinese authorities have said the market is the likely source of the coronavirus . 
Medical supplies for the Chinese government , including thousands of surgical masks , safety goggles and 50 protective suits , were also flown into Wuhan .
