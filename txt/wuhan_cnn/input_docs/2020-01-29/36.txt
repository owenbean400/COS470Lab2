The crew of the plane was completely separated from the passengers , Alaska â€™s Chief Medical Officer Dr . Anne Zink said in a news conference . 
" The way this plane was put together , the upper level with the crew was completely separated from the lower passengers , " Zink said .

Who is on the flight ? 
About three dozen US diplomats and their families were expected to be on board the aircraft , a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN previously .
