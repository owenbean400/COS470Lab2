China has still not invited US health experts to help with the fight against the Wuhan virus even though the US made the offer more than a month ago , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Friday . 
Azar said the US has experts " ready , willing and able " to go to China and his department would like to get the effort underway quickly . 
But the Chinese government has its own decision making process and " we have to respect that , " the secretary told a news conference .
