Chinese President Xi Jinping is facing a major challenge to his vast system of censorship and information control , but history does not bode well for those aligned against him . 
Following revelations that authorities in Wuhan downplayed news of the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak while it was in its early stages , and police cracked down on people spreading " rumors " about the deadly virus , there have been numerous calls for freedom of speech and a relaxation of censorship . 
They only increased after the death of Li Wenliang , a Wuhan doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the virus , officially called Covid 19 , only to be reprimanded by police . 
Li died in hospital last week from the virus , after belatedly being praised by Chinese authorities . 
Following his death , hundreds of thousands of people posted demands for free speech online -- that were themselves quickly scrubbed by the censors . 
As the outrage threatened to boil over , Beijing quickly dispatched an anti corruption task force to Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- with the clear implication that they would come back with some scalps to assuage public anger . 
At the same time , state media ramped up positive stories about efforts to rein in the outbreak , and Xi himself made his first public appearance related to the virus .
