The Chinese province at the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak reported a record spike in deaths Thursday , bringing the total number to more than 1,300 infections globally . 
Hubei announced an additional 242 deaths and 14,840 cases of the virus as of Thursday morning , the largest single day rise since the epidemic began and almost 10 times the number of cases confirmed the previous day . 
The government explained the spike is due to a change in how cases are tabulated . 
What now counts as a confirmed case ? 
The total will now include " clinically diagnosed cases " after rising numbers of residents complained about the difficulty in getting tested and treated for the virus . 
Who falls into that category ? 
" Clinically diagnosed cases " are those patients who demonstrate all the symptoms of the novel coronavirus but have been unable to be scientifically tested , or died before they were tested . 
What effect will this have ? 
The hope is that more people will be able to receive treatment by allowing doctors to diagnose them with the virus . 
Case number confusion : The massive increase in the number of cases exposes confusion over just how to diagnose the virus globally . 
Delayed diagnosis : Delays in diagnosing the virus could be significant . 
There are reports of patients waiting up to a week for their results , as the testing kits were sent from Hubei to a lab in Beijing . 
While there have been efforts to speed up the process , scientific testing of samples is difficult and time consuming , and allowing doctors to diagnose patients will enable far more people to receive treatment , including in several purpose built hospitals dedicated to treating the virus in Wuhan . 
Not just China : In the US , the CDC currently requires that all potential samples are shipped to its central laboratories for full testing .
