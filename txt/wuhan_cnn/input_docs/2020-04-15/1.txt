Members of the World Health Organization on Wednesday defended their early actions when it came to fighting the coronavirus . 
Dr . Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization ’s health emergencies program said , " when WHO issued its first guidance to countries , it was extremely clear that respiratory precautions should be taken in dealing with patients with this disease , that labs needed to be careful in terms of their precautions and taking samples , because there was a risk that the disease could spread from person to person in those environments . " 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , an infectious diseases epidemiologist with WHO , said she recently went back and listened to the WHO news conference on January 14 , and at the time , there were 41 confirmed cases worldwide . 
" All of our guidance that was before we did that press conference was about limiting exposure to people and to prevent transmission , particularly in health care settings , " adding " our guidance that was put out was about respiratory droplets and contact protection , " Van Kerkove said . 
Noting , that was out on January 10 and 11 . 
Ryan said health systems around the world , including the United States , began to activate incident management systems during the first week of January . 
" In the initial reports , in which there were no mention of human to human transmission , was a cluster of atypical pneumonia or pneumonia or unknown origin , " he said . 
" The idea of having a defense , at this point , seems rather strange , " Ryan said . 
Ryan went on to say that " there are literally millions and millions of cases of atypical pneumonia around the world , every year , " adding , in the middle of flu season , " sometimes it 's very difficult to pick out a signal of a cluster of cases . 
In fact , it 's quite remarkable that such a cluster was picked out — 41 confirmed cases ultimately in a cluster in Wuhan . "
