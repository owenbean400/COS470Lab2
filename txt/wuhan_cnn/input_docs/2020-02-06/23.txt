Li Wenliang , the Chinese whistleblower doctor who was reprimanded by Wuhan Police after warning the public of a potential " SARS like " disease in December 2019 , died of coronavirus in Wuhan in the early hours of Friday morning ( local time ) , according to a statement from Wuhan Central Hospital . 
" Our hospital 's ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was unfortunately infected with coronavirus during his work in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic , " the statement read . 
" He died at 2:58 a.m . on Feb 7 after attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful . " 
The statement came after hours of confusion over Li ’s status . 
Earlier on Thursday , several state media outlets reported Li ’s death , following Chinese social media erupting into profound grief and anger . 
A short time later , Wuhan Central Hospital released a statement saying Li was still alive and in critical condition , adding that they were " making attempts to resuscitate him . " 
State media subsequently deleted their previous tweets . 
About Li : After he alerted colleagues in December , Li was questioned by local health authorities and was later summoned by Wuhan police to sign a reprimand letter in which he was accused of " spreading rumors online " and " severely disrupting social order . " 
Li was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak , which has sickened more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560 . 
He later contracted the virus himself . 
Li was hospitalized on Jan . 12 and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb . 1 .
