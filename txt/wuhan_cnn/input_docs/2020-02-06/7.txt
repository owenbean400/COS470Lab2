Two newborn babies in Wuhan , China , have been infected with the novel coronavirus , according to China 's state broadcaster CCTV . 
The youngest baby was diagnosed at just 30 hours old . 
The baby 's mother was also infected with the virus , and CCTV suggested that " there may be mother infant transmission , " where the mother passes the virus on to the baby in utero . 
Other possibilities : Without more details , it 's impossible to know if the infants were infected in the womb . 
There are other ways they could have been exposed -- through handling by healthcare workers , mothers coughing , breastfeeding or even in the delivery process . 
Paul Hunter , a medical professor at Britain 's University of East Anglia , said that a baby born vaginally is exposed to the mother 's gut microbiome -- meaning " if a baby does get infected with coronavirus a few days after birth we currently cannot tell if the baby was infected in the womb or during birth . " 
Researchers still learning : Nancy Messonnier , a director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , warned that " there is a lot about the novel coronavirus that we do not know . "
