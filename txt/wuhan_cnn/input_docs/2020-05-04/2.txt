Doctors at a Paris hospital claim to have found evidence a patient who got sick in December was infected with the novel coronavirus . 
If verified , it may show the virus was circulating in Europe as early as December . 
The first reports of Covid 19 in France were reported on Jan . 24 , in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan , China . 
Yves Cohen and colleagues at the Paris hospital decided to check the records of patients who got sick before the Jan . 24 cases to see if the virus may have been spreading undetected earlier than first thought . 
The French team looked at people admitted to the hospital with flu like illnesses between Dec . 2 and Jan . 16 who were not subsequently diagnosed with influenza . 
The doctors re tested samples stored in a freezer for coronavirus . 
" One sample was positive , taken from a 42 year old man born in Algeria , who lived in France for many years and worked as a fishmonger , " the team wrote in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents . 
" His last trip was in Algeria during August 2019 , " they wrote . 
The man had not been to China , and one of his children had also been sick , the team reported . 
" Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS COV 2 and its spreading in the country . 
Moreover , the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December 2019 , " they wrote . 
Remember : This claim has not yet been independently verified . 
Europe did not start reporting cases of coronavirus until January . 
In Italy , the European country hit hardest by the virus , the first two cases were reported on Jan . 31 , in two Chinese tourists in Rome . 
The first known community transmission was recorded in February in Codogno , in northern Italy .
