When asked about whether he thought the origination of the coronavirus was nefarious or a mistake on Sunday , US President Donald Trump said he believes it was " a horrible mistake . " 
During a town hall on Fox News Sunday , Trump added that China " did not want to admit it , " and that China was embarrassed by the problem and was unable to " put the fire out . " 
Both Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said they believe the virus had its origins in a lab in Wuhan , China , and not at a market in the city , but neither provided evidence . 
Earlier in the week , Trump implied that China knowingly let the virus spread around the globe . 
During the town hall , Trump also seemed to indicate that he will make public a " strong report on exactly what we think happened " in regards to the origin of the virus , and that the report will be " very conclusive . "
