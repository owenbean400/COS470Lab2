All passengers arriving into Shanghai from abroad will be tested for the coronavirus , Shanghai â€™s Health Commission announced on Sunday . 
The measure will apply even to those arriving from areas where the virus is not widespread . 
Beijing flights : On Sunday , the government announced that all international flights to Beijing will be diverted to other cities in China starting Monday . 
Passengers on affected flights will need to clear immigration and customs at their first port of entry . 
Those deemed healthy will then be allowed to board the same aircraft to fly onwards to Beijing , the government said . 
The bigger picture : Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , has not reported any new cases for four days in a row . 
But now there is a new focus in the fight against coronavirus : people bringing the virus into China . 
China recorded 46 new coronavirus cases on Saturday -- and all but one came from abroad . 
That brings the total number of imported cases to 314 .
