Wuhan , the Chinese city at ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic , will need to see 14 consecutive days of no new cases before travel restrictions can be lifted , a top Chinese health expert told state media on Tuesday . 
Speaking to the state run China Daily newspaper , Li Lanjuan , a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and senior adviser to the country â€™s top health authority said : Mainland China has seen a steady decline in locally transmitted cases for weeks , even as numbers skyrocketed across the rest of the world . 
Today , China reported its first day of no new domestic cases since the outbreak started -- all new cases were imported from abroad . 
Wuhan had been reporting cases in the single digits leading up to today 's announcement . 
The rest of the country has been slowly relaxing restrictions on people 's movements in the past week , with highways reopening and quarantine stations closing . 
Inter provincial travel , which had previously been shut down entirely , is gradually resuming . 
People from other provinces are now allowed into Hubei province , of which Wuhan is the capital , if they pass temperature checks and have the appropriate " health codes " -- color coded passes that indicate permission to travel .
