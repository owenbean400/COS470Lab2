The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hubei province , China , has increased for two successive days after a period of decline , the World Health Organization said in its daily report on Sunday . 
" WHO is monitoring the situation and working to understand its possible significance , " the report said . 
The epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak is in Wuhan , the capital of Hubei province , and aggressive measures were taken in the province to contain the virus . 
On Wednesday , for the first time since the start of the outbreak , the number of new cases reported outside of China in a single day was larger than those reported inside China , WHO said . 
Still , most of the new cases in China were in Hubei . 
Dr . Liang Wannian , a senior official with China â€™s National Health Commission , said during a WHO press conference last week that despite " good news " of decreasing cases and deaths in Wuhan , " the current situation is still grim and complex . " 
Hundreds of new cases were confirmed and suspected every day , he said , " which means that the epidemic situation has not yet been completely contained by us . "
