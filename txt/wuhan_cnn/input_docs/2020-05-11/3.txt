Fortunately , all three countries have systems in place to detect and respond to a resurgence in cases . " 
Tedros added that WHO has released guidance and six criteria for countries to consider before lifting lockdown measures . 
" WHO is working closely with governments to ensure that key public health measures remain in place to deal with the challenge of lifting lockdowns , " Tedros said .
