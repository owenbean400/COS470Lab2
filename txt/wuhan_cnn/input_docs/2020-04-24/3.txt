It was just three months ago that Mr Wang was paying the workers at his Wuhan restaurant their Chinese New Year bonuses and celebrating his third year in business . 
Now , after 76 days under lockdown in the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak , he has been left mentally and financially drained , with his business facing ruin . 
The lockdown on Wuhan was lifted on April 8 . 
But two weeks later Wang 's restaurant is still not allowed to fully reopen , due to restrictions on eat in dining . 
Despite having no business , he 's still had to pay three months rent -- worth almost $ 8,500 ( 60,000 yuan ) . 
With fears rising of a second wave of infections which could cause even more financial pain across China , Wang said he has no choice but to close shop . 
" In Wuhan , there are many people like us who can no longer go back to what they were doing before the outbreak , " he said . 
Wang asked us to only use his first name over concerns about the consequences of talking to foreign media . 
Wang is just one of Wuhan 's many business owners struggling to get back on their feet in a difficult local economy . 
In the first quarter of the year alone , the economy of Hubei province , of which Wuhan is the capital , shrank by almost 40 % , according to state run news agency Xinhua . 
That 's in addition to the mental toll from a strict and lengthy lockdown , the fear of the viral outbreak itself and grief at the loss of loved ones and friends . 
Wang said three relatives had caught the novel coronavirus , one of whom passed away from the disease . 
The family was unable to have a funeral for him . 
" During that period , we were actually really terrified , really terrified , " he said .
