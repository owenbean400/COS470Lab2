But now , life is slowly returning to normal , with the outbreak appearing largely under control . 
" I want to show you some video we captured as we drive through one of the commercial streets in particular , " said Culver from Wuhan .

The stores have moved products to the front , and changed their procedures , to reduce interactions between customers and staff and keep stores as uncrowded as possible .
