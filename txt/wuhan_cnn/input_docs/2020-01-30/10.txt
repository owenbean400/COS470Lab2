China 's largest state run media outlets are belatedly going big on the Wuhan virus Thursday morning , a week after the city at the center of the outbreak was placed under lockdown . 
Both state broadcaster CCTV -- known as CGTN internationally -- and news agency Xinhua were leading their websites with multiple stories about the virus and efforts to stem its spread across the country . 
The top story on both was President Xi Jinping ordering the military to aid in containing the virus . 
While the Wuhan virus has been headline news around the world for weeks , its coverage in China has been more mixed . 
More independently minded outlets , particularly Caixin , The Paper and the Beijing News , have been dedicating significant resources and space to the virus , but state and Communist Party outlets have been more restrained for the most . 
( Though some internationally focused publications , like the English language Global Times , have been covering it extensively . ) 
For much of the crisis , the Wuhan virus was not the primary story on Xinwen Lianbo , CCTV 's main daily news broadcast , watched by hundreds of millions of people across China . 
Last week , as Wuhan was being placed under lockdown and cases of the virus were spreading worldwide , the People 's Daily -- the official mouthpiece of the Party -- was still playing it well below the fold . 
With the Wuhan crisis expanding even more in the past week , and Xi taking personal control over the response , the approach to covering it in state media appears to have shifted -- we can likely expect more banner headlines about Xi 's orders in the days to come .
