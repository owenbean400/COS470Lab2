An American who flew out of China on a chartered flight tried to leave the Southern California military base where authorities have been monitoring nearly 200 people for coronavirus symptoms , health officials said . 
The person , who was not identified , has been ordered to stay in quarantine at the March Air Reserve Base near Riverside , California , until the " entire incubation period or until otherwise cleared , " Riverside County Public Health said . 
The incubation period will be 14 days . 
" This action was taken as a result of the unknown risk to the public should someone leave MARB early without undergoing a full health evaluation , " the agency said Thursday . 
Nearly 200 Americans arrived Wednesday at the military base from Wuhan , the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China , and were asked to stay for at least three days so they can be monitored for coronavirus symptoms .
