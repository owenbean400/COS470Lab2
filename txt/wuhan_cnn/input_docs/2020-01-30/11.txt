Tibet has now confirmed its first case of the Wuhan coronavirus , Chinese health authorities said Thursday . 
Tibet was previously the only region administered by the Chinese government to have avoided the virus . 
Now , all provinces , autonomous regions , special administrative regions ( Hong Kong and Macao ) and municipalities have confirmed cases . 
Cases have also been confirmed in the self governing island of Taiwan . 
The spread to Tibet , a remote and mountainous region , will renew concerns about how easily the virus is transmitted , particularly when people are asymptomatic . 
On Tuesday , Tibet announced the indefinite closure of all tourist attractions , state run newspaper People â€™s Daily reported , citing the regional Communist Party committee . 
All travelers , including tourists , entering Tibet are now required to register with authorities and be quarantined for 14 days . 
There are now 7,711 confirmed cases in mainland China , with 4,586 in Hubei province , where the outbreak originated .
