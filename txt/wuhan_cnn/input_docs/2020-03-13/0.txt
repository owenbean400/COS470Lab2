CNN Correspondent David Culver , reporting from Shanghai , joined CNN 's coronavirus town hall to describe the improving situation in China . 
Just a few weeks ago , the country was reporting thousands of cases a day . 
Now , it 's down to about a dozen a day on average — a huge drop . 
Remember : Whistleblowers in Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak , like Dr . Li Wenliang , tried to warn people and sound the alarm as early as December — but were punished and censored by local officials . 
Li later died of the coronavirus . 
What changed : The central government 's involvement , Culver said . 
" They pushed out the local government . 
They said , we 're taking control . 
It became a military like operation . 
They began ramping up production of face masks . 
Our daily lives changed drastically . " 
What China looks like now : Things are slowly getting back to normal , now that the outbreak seems largely contained in most of the country . 
" Just today the parks are reopening in Shanghai , restaurants have given the all clear to have as many people as they need to party wise to come in and book a table . 
Tourist attractions are starting to reopen , " said Culver — a jarring difference from life in China just weeks ago , when people did not dare go outside , and when major cities felt like ghost towns .
