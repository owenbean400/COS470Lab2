Numbers suggesting death rates from coronavirus may be higher inside Wuhan and lower elsewhere may reflect " severe " pressure on the health care system there , Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organization 's Health Emergencies Programme , told reporters Tuesday . 
Ryan was responding to a report published Monday by scientists with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , showing that patient outcomes in Hubei province are a key driver of the 2.3 % case fatality rate they calculated . 
In Hubei , that number is 2.9 % ; in other Chinese provinces , that number is 0.4 % . 
The upside , Ryan added , is that " the lessons that have been learned in Hubei and Wuhan are being applied elsewhere . " 
Those lessons include predicting who 's most at risk , getting people into critical care early , and ensuring medical teams are well trained in advanced critical care techniques such as ventilation . 
" I think the system in China , for example , has got much better at prioritizing those more likely be severely ill , " said Ryan , who maintained that the case fatality rate can be misleading without proper context .
