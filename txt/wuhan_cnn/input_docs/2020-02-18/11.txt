After several deaths of healthcare employees as a result of the novel coronavirus , the Chinese government is under criticism for how it is treating its medical workers . 
Two of the most notable deaths include those of Li Wenliang , the whistleblower doctor credited for warning about the virus , and Liu Zhiming , director of the Wuchang hospital in Wuhan , the city at the center of the outbreak . 
CNN 's Kristie Lu Stout reports that , " China says it will designate all of them — the frontline doctors , nurses and medics who died while fighting the virus — as martyrs of the epicenter of the outbreak . " 
As of Friday , China 's National Health Commission ( NHC ) says at least 1,716 healthcare workers nationwide had been infected by the virus .
