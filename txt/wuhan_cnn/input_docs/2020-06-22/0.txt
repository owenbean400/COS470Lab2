The number of new coronavirus cases dropped into the single digits in Beijing on Sunday , with nine out of China 's 18 new confirmed cases coming from the city , according to the National Health Commission ( NHC ) . 
The Chinese capital has been trying to contain the spread of a fresh outbreak that emerged from its largest wholesale food market earlier this month . 
Mass testing has been rolled out across the city of 20 million , with mask donning residents forming long lines at makeshift testing centers in sweltering summer heat . 
Beijing authorities said they had collected samples from more than 2.29 million people as of Saturday for coronavirus tests . 
There are currently 2,083 testing stations operating at 474 testing sites set up across the city , according to municipal authorities . 
Since the new outbreak , Beijing 's testing capacity has more than doubled , increasing from 100,000 to over 230,000 tests per day at 124 facilities , Gao Xiaojun , spokesman for the Beijing Health Commission , told a press briefing on Sunday . 
If the samples taken from five individuals are combined together and tested in a single tube -- a method known as " pool testing , " Beijing can get 1 million people tested daily , Gao added . 
The method was adopted in Wuhan , the original epicenter of the pandemic , in May , when the central Chinese city conducted 6.5 million coronavirus tests in just nine days to prevent a second wave of infections .
