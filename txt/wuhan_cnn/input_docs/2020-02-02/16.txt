A number of UK citizens who failed to leave the coronavirus struck Chinese city of Wuhan last week are now on a second flight to Europe , UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Sunday . 
Speaking to Sky News , Raab said he could not confirm the " precise number " of those arriving into the UK on Sunday . 
A number of UK citizens had trouble reaching the muster point in time for the first flight out because of road blocks and other restrictions in place in Wuhan . 
Britons being brought from Wuhan to the UK are being placed in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral , northwest England , Raab said . 
The first flight on Friday returned 83 UK nationals .
