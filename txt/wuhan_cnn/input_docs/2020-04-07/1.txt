China reported no new novel coronavirus deaths or locally transmitted cases yesterday , according to the country 's National Health Commission . 
There were 32 new cases -- all of them imported from abroad . 
This is the first time China has reported no new coronavirus deaths since the NHC began releasing daily updates in late January . 
China has now recorded a total of 81,740 cases and 3,331 deaths , according to the NHC . 
This does not represent the total number of active cases , but rather the number of infections since the pandemic began . 
Of those total cases , 77,167 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospitals , according to the NHC . 
Much of China is returning to normal life . 
Hubei province -- ground zero for the pandemic -- and many other parts of the country have been under lockdown and movement restrictions for three months , but curbs designed to stop the spread of the virus are beginning to loosen as the perceived level of threat subsides . 
Tomorrow , the lockdown on Wuhan , the city at the epicenter of the outbreak , will be lifted -- a significant milestone in its battle against the deadly virus . 
Starting tomorrow , people will be allowed to leave Wuhan and Hubei if they have a green QR code on their mobile phones , which the provincial government has distributed as an indicator of people 's health status .
