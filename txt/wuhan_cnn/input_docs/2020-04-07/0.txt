China 's state run Xinhua news agency has released its official timeline of the coronavirus pandemic , from the original outbreak in mainland China to its global spread by March 31 . 
Full of praise for the government 's efforts to control the outbreak , the lengthy timeline makes no mention of international criticism of the country 's secrecy around the first cases of the virus nor their official response . 
According to Xinhua , the outbreak was first detected in late December 2019 , contradicting reports from the Wuhan health authorities who said cases were found as early as December 12 . 
There is no early mention of doctor Li Wenliang 's attempts to raise awareness of the virus on December 30 or how he was summoned to a police station on January 3 , where he had to sign a statement promising not to commit further " unlawful acts . " 
The timeline only reports that Wuhan announced a pneumonia outbreak in the city on December 31 . 
Li , who died of the coronavirus in February , is mentioned once in the official timeline on March 19 , when the Wuhan Public Security Bureau officially apologized and revoked his reprimand letter . 
Why he was reprimanded is not mentioned . 
The timeline explicitly says that China began to inform the United States about the outbreak on January 3 .
