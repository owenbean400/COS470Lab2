Canadian officials say they are " 95 % sure " the country has its first case of the Wuhan coronavirus , health authorities in the province of Ontario said Friday . 
The patient is a man in his 50s who traveled to Wuhan . 
He flew to Toronto on January 21 and arrived in the city a day later . 
On the 23rd , he became ill and asked a family member to call emergency services and inform them of the situation , said Dr . David Williams , the Ontario chief medical officer of health . 
The patient was immediately taken to hospital and is now in a negative pressure room , which helps stop the spread of germs . 
Canadian authorities are calling it a " presumptive confirmed case " because a preliminary test was positive for the Wuhan coronavirus . 
They are still waiting for confirmation from the national medical laboratory in Winnipeg .
