Wan officials have walked back an announcement from earlier today , which claimed travel restrictions were easing in the Chinese city where the outbreak began . 
The earlier announcement has been ruled " invalid , " according to a post on social platform Weibo by the city â€™s government . 
The initial announcement was " issued by the traffic prevention and control team in a circumstance that was not discussed with the command office and was not agreed by major leadership , " said the Weibo post . 
It added that the city is " resolutely " implementing the instructions by Chinese President Xi Jinping to prevent the virus spreading further , and that the " relevant personnel " had been " criticized . " 
Some context : Wuhan has been under lockdown for over a month now , with no movement in or out . 
Earlier , the now invalid announcement had suggested some healthy citizens would gradually be allowed to exit and Wuhan residents elsewhere in China could apply to return .
