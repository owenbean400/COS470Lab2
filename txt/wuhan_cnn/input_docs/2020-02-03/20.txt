Though China 's Lunar New Year holiday has drawn to a close , many have not returned to major cities as the Wuhan coronavirus spreads throughout the country . 
Considered the largest human migration on the planet , Chunyun -- the 40 day period when Chinese people head home to celebrate the Lunar New Year with their families -- officially began on January 10 and will end on February 18 . 
Authorities had previously estimated that 3 billion journeys would take place . 
In Beijing , however , it appears many people have chosen not to return . 
Rong Jun , the deputy commissioner of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transportation , said that train and flight bookings for inbound travel to the Chinese capital had dropped over 70 % year on year for the coming days , though did not specify a time frame . 
Travel in and out of Beijing dropped more than 60 % during the Lunar New Year period of January 24-30 , compared to the same time last year , and there appears to be a continued decrease on inbound traffic in the coming days , according to the Beijing city government . 
Many regions across China are still under travel restrictions and the Beijing city government has delayed the re opening schools and non essential businesses to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus .
