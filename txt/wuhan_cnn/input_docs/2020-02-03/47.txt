Employees of many companies that have suspended operations in China should be receiving their paychecks as usual . 
Following the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday because of the outbreak of coronavirus , China ’s government has reinforced labor laws that require employees to be compensated while on vacation . 
Local governments have also formulated their own announcements based on the law , according to Matthew Margulies , vice president of China operations at the US China Business Council . 
Employees who have been infected by the virus will still receive compensation , added Margulies . 
Additionally , employees that were required to work over the extended holiday will be paid extra . 
Initially set to run to January 30 , the Chinese government extended the holiday nationwide to February 2 . 
While business has now resumed in certain areas like Beijing , others like Shanghai and Hubei province are still in lockdown for at least another week . 
Starbucks and Mc Donald ’s have closed all their Hubei stores indefinitely while Honda and Renault have extended the shutdown period in their Wuhan plants until February 13 . 
Other large companies , such as Peugeot and Toyota , have halted operations at their Chinese plants . 
Webasto , an auto part company which confirmed last week that four of its employees based at its headquarters near Munich were affected by the virus , has closed its operation in Wuhan until February 14 . 
A spokesperson for the German company confirmed that workers would be fully paid during the closure .
