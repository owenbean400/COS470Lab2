Over the weekend , two special Air India aircrafts brought home more than 650 Indian passengers from Wuhan . 
The passengers have been quarantined in two separate camps in and around the country ’s capital , New Delhi . 
One returnee told CNN that he was worried about being placed in close quarters with others on the flights : " There are around 20 of us in a room which is a bit scary , " said Mohahammad Haseeb , a Ph D student at Wuhan University ’s Economics department . 
" We sit together for our meals , " he added , saying they will be quarantined until February 15 , when test results come back .
