Ground zero of the novel coronavirus pandemic is in Wuhan , China but it 's epicenter -- where the majority of new cases are popping up -- is a moving target , shifting globally as the virus spreads . 
Europe is the current epicenter , and Italy in particular -- the country is nearing 70,000 cases and 7,000 fatalities , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University . 
But Italy 's rate of new infections and fatalities could slow as the calendar ticks closer to two weeks since the country went on lockdown . 
Experts say that since Covid 19 is believed to have an incubation period ranging from one to 14 days , it takes those full two weeks to see the benefits of any measures advising or ordering people to stay at home . 
Italy went on total lockdown on March 13 -- meaning Friday will be two weeks since the measure came into force . 
US states began enacting their own drastic travel restrictions in recent days , but nothing has been federally mandated . 
According to CNN 's tally of US cases , there were at least 52,976 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States as of Tuesday night , and more than 700 people have died . 
The tally is based on numbers of confirmed cases provided by state and local health departments . 
CNN 's tally of total confirmed cases has increased by at least 23 % each day since March 4 -- in some cases , much more steeply . 
From March 18 to March 19 , confirmed US cases rose 51 % in just one day , from 8,760 to 13,229 , the largest one day increase in recent weeks . 
But public health experts , including the US surgeon general , have warned the worst is yet to come .
