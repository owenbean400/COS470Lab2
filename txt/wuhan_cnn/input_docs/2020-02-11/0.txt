Health officials in Hong Kong evacuated some residents from an apartment block following concerns two people contracted the coronavirus via the building 's piping system . 
" As the pipeline that transfers feces is connected to the air pipe , it is very likely for the virus in the feces to be transmitted through the air fan into the toilet , " Professor KY Yuen said during an impromptu midnight press conference held Tuesday morning local time . 
Health officials have traced at least two confirmed cases of the coronavirus to Hong Mei House in Tsing Yi , a small residential island in Hong Kong . 
Parts of the building were evacuated while health officials and engineers carried out emergency checks . 
Professor Yuen said the transmission route is not clear yet , so the evacuation was taken as a precautionary measure to protect the building 's residents . 
Hong Kong now has 42 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus . 
Some are believed to have been locally infected , according to Hong Kong 's Centre for Health Protection .
