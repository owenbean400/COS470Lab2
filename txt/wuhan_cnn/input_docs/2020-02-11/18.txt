World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he believes there is a " realistic chance " of stopping the Wuhan coronavirus . 
" We have to invest in preparedness , " he said , adding that richer countries should help invest in countries with a weaker health system . 
The director general said the virus could " create havoc " if it reaches a country whose health system is not capable of handling such an epidemic . 
" I have a great concern that if this virus makes it to a weaker health system it will create havoc , " he said . 
He cautioned that the fact that thus far authorities have been able to prevent that , " It does not mean it will not happen â€” it may . "
