A group of US evacuees who were taken out of the coronavirus epicenter in Wuhan last week and are now in quarantine have petitioned the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to test them as soon as possible . 
The evacuees , who are currently at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California , thanked the CDC for their support but asked to be tested to identify potential infections quickly . 
" We believe testing everyone at the facility would help identify potential suspects as early as possible , so the appropriate treatment could be put in place , " according to the petition , which is written in both Chinese and English . 
Two people who were evacuated to Miramar have already been diagnosed with the virus and sent into isolation . 
The CDC said that it is listening to the evacuees ' concerns but testing people who are asymptomatic may provide a false negative . 
" A false negative could provide a false sense of security , " Christopher Braden , a CDC official who is with the evacuees in San Diego , said in a statement Thursday .
