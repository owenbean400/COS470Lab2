Researchers in China reported results from one of the first Covid 19 vaccine trials Friday , but experts who spoke to CNN were skeptical of their findings and called the data lukewarm . 
In a study published in the medical journal The Lancet , researchers said their vaccine was well tolerated and generated an immune response against the novel coronavirus . 
The vaccine , developed by Can Sino Biological Inc . and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology , was tested in 108 healthy , uninfected adults aged 18 to 60 in Wuhan , China -- the original ground zero of the pandemic . 
All the participants received injections at low , middle or high doses , and no " serious " side effects were reported , researchers said . 
Side effects : Still , almost half of vaccine recipients reported fever , with 44 % reporting fatigue and 39 % reporting a headache . 
Overall , 9 % of patients reported side effects that were severe enough to have potentially " prevented activity . " 
These side effects are " not a good safety sign , " said Dr . Paul Offit , director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia . 
Experts also suggested the vaccine did not elicit a strong immune response ; all the doses , even the " low " dose , were actually very high , Offit said .
