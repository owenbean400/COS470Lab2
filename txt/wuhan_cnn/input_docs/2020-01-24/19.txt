Videos and witness accounts are being shared on Chinese social media of packed and overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan , the 11 million strong city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak . 
CNN has not been able to independently verify the videos . 
However , CNN producers have analyzed images in the videos and the dialects of the people speaking and believe them to be genuine . 
The content from these videos matches Chinese state owned media â€™s reporting that medical facilities in Wuhan have been overwhelmed with patients . 
In one widely shared video , a hospital corridor can be seen packed with patients . 
A female medical practitioner shouts , " Everyone stop speaking ! 
Listen to me ! 
Be quiet ! " 
She instructs medical staff to " get all the people coming for the test results to line up outside , " before shouting at patients , " Everyone coming to check their test results , follow this young man to the entrance and line up ! 
Go out first ! 
Line up ! 
Do not be nervous ! " 
All voices in this video are speaking in either Wuhan dialect or Mandarin with a Wuhan accent . 
Another video shared on social media appears to show white tents set up outside a hospital in Wuhan . 
Signage on the tents reads in Chinese characters " China Health . " 
One other sign post in between the tents reads in Chinese characters " Patients ' Path . " 
Chinese state media previously reported that construction has begun on a new 1,000 bed hospital in Wuhan to help alleviate the rush of patients . 
The new hospital is expected to be ready by February 3 .
