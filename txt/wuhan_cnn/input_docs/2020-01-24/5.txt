Speaking to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV , medical workers in Wuhan -- the city of 11 million people at the center of the coronavirus outbreak -- have described an incredibly intense environment , where they must balance dealing with the overload of patients and suspected patients while also keeping themselves safe . 
" Today , I heard one of my colleagues say that she has got blisters on her face , " Wang Jun , a nurse at Jinyintan Hospital , told the broadcaster . 
" It happened because she had to keep the face mask on tight for a long time . " 
Wang described the laborious process nurses undergo to enter hygienic areas : Another nurse , Fan Li , said that she often goes a whole shift without being able to go to the bathroom or get a drink of water . 
" I would drink some water before my shift , and wait till the end of my shift to drink water again or use the toilet , " she said . 
" We ca not do either of those things in the wards . " 
They also have to deal with the potential of being infected themselves -- or simply succumbing to exhaustion . 
" Many of my friends and colleagues called me yesterday and asked if I 'm alright , " Fan said . 
" It was quite touching . 
They said the medical staff of the Jinyintan Hospital are the greatest as we work on the front line . 
I feel very moved . "
