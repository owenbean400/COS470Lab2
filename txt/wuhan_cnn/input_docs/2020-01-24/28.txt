Ten cities in Hubei have been placed under emergency travel restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus , including the provincial capital Wuhan , where the new pathogen was first detected . 
Wuhan is under effective lockdown , with all public transport in and out of the city closed . 
Other cities across Hubei are under less severe travel restrictions , but the number of cities affected is growing . 
They include Ezhou , Huanggang , Chibi , Xiantao , Zhijiang , Qianjiang , Huangshi , Xianning and Yichang . 
Earlier Friday , the province upgraded its emergency response level to 1 , the highest level . 
Beijing and Shanghai have also instituted Level 1 emergency responses , as have several other cities across China . 
Restrictions include shutting down railway stations , bus stations , intercity transport links , or preventing private vehicles from driving on certain roads . 
Authorities in each of the cities have not yet announced when these restrictions will be lifted .
