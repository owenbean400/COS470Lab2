A medical student who lives in Wuhan told CNN what it is like living in a city under effective lockdown . 
On Thursday , Yasin Gaardo , from Somalia , filmed videos of deserted streets and near empty shelves in grocery stores . 
" It ’s inconvenient to stay here in Wuhan , " he told CNN Friday , on the second day of travel restrictions . 
The city tends to empty out during the Lunar New Year season , but Gaardo added that the streets were more vacant than usual . 
" I can say I ’m worried but I ’m not in panic mode right now , " he said . 
In one video , filmed outside a store in Wuhan 's Qiaokou district , he can be heard saying : He told CNN that during a food shop on Thursday he found it hard to hail taxis . 
" I waited for 40 minutes . 
Public transportation is locked up and it ’s very risky to go in public places . 
90 % of Wuhan people are staying inside , " he said . 
" You barely see anyone in the streets . 
They ’re empty now . "
