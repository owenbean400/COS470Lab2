Human to human transmission has been confirmed for the Wuhan coronavirus , but experts are now trying to understand who is transmitting it most , who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community . 
When it comes to human to human transmission of the viruses , often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person 's secretions , such as droplets in a cough . 
Depending on how virulent the virus is , a cough , sneeze or handshake could cause exposure . 
The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes . 
Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient 's waste , according to the CDC .
