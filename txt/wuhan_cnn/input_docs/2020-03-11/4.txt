Robert O ’Brien , President Trump ’s national security adviser , blasted the Chinese government for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan , saying they " covered up " the outbreak and " probably " cost the world " two months to respond . " 
" There ’s lots of open source reporting from China , from Chinese nationals that the doctors involved were either silenced or , or put in isolation or that sort of thing so word of this virus could not get out , " O ’Brien told a crowd at the Heritage Foundation in Washington . 
" If we had those and been able to sequence the virus and had the cooperation necessary from the Chinese , had a WHO team been on the ground , had a CDC team which we ’d offered been on the ground , I think we could ’ve dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what ’s now happening across the world , " he continued . 
O ’Brien also urged Americans to heed the warnings of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and take precautions to prevent further spread of coronavirus . 
" If you ’ve got a coworker who sneezes , send them home , " he said , adding that people should practice social distancing , wash their hands routinely , and take other protective measures . 
O ’Brien , whose speech notably drew a smaller than usual crowd amid fears of crowded places , described the President ’s response to the outbreak in the US as " courageous , " particularly for his decision to temporarily freeze air travel to highly affected areas . 
The coronavirus has currently spread to six continents , roiled financial and oil markets and have led to the cancellation of events , classes and other gatherings across the country .
