China â€™s National Health Commission has said the Wuhan coronavirus can be transmitted through contact , as well as droplets . 
The announcement , released in a statement Tuesday morning , follows results of the fourth trial of a coronavirus treatment scheme run by the NHC . 
On Monday the NHC said the major transmission mode of the Wuhan coronavirus is through " close range droplet transmission . " 
Droplet transmission is when a virus is passed on due to an infected person sneezing or coughing , and another comes into contact with those infected particles . 
That is still the case , but contact is also at play , the NHC said . 
No further details were given as to what type of contact could transmit the virus . 
All ages at risk : The NHC also said that people of all ages are susceptible , including children and infants , and adds that elderly patients and people with underlying conditions have more severe symptoms after infection .
