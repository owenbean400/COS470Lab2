At a bus station near the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen , in mainland China , some residents tell CNN they are concerned about the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus . 
" I ’m worried . 
If they close ( the border ) now it ’s too late . 
If they have ( the virus ) it is already in Hong Kong , " said Chan Moon , 38 , a property agent . 
" Hong Kong is small and congested , if the virus breaks out -- I ’m worried that it will be like SARS . " 
SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , was a coronavirus identified in southern China that infected 8,000 people and killed more than 700 between 2002 and 2003 . 
Ms Chow , 55 , who was traveling from the border at Lo Wu to her home in Sheung Shui , in Hong Kong 's New Territories , said that she had to go through automatic checks at the border and had filled in a health declaration form . 
Later on Tuesday , Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the government will " temporarily " close some of its borders with mainland China , cut flights from the mainland and suspend cross border ferry services , in an effort to curb the spread of the virus .
