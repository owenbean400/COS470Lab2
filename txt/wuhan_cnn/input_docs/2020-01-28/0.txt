The US Food and Drug Administration is working with other government agencies to encourage the development of medical products that may diagnose , treat or fight the virus . 
There is no vaccine , treatment or commercially available product to even test for the virus . 
The FDA created a page on its website to keep the public up to date about any products in development in relation to the Wuhan coronavirus . 
It also put a call out to diagnostic test sponsors that may want to use the Emergency Use Authorization to get a product that could test for the virus into the market . 
The FDA is also working with public health agencies to share the reference materials that companies may need to create a test .
