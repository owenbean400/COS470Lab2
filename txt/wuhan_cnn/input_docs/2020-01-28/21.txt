Wayne Dupleiss is a Canadian citizen who lives and works in Wuhan with his family . 
He 's currently under lockdown in the city , along with 11 million other people , as officials try and contain the spread of the coronavirus . 
There is no public transportation , no buses , trams , or taxis . 
He says they are coping " as best we can . " 
" We ’ve been able to get out to buy groceries and water and we 've found a local person that will deliver food and water . 
Thats helpful . 
Right now we have enough , " he told CNN via Skype from his home . 
Dupleiss said that his family have been able to get face masks but not hand sanitizer . 
He said stores in the city are still being replenished and delivery trucks are coming , despite the lockdown . 
Outside , the streets of Wuhan seem deserted . 
It 's " quite eerie , " Dupleiss said . 
" We 've been told to wash your hands , do not go out , wear masks , and now they are talking about wearing goggles . 
And do not congregate , do not go out in groups , " he said . 
While some countries are attempting to evacuate their citizens out fo Wuhan , Dupleiss said he and his family , " will stay put until we know more . " 
" I think that it is probably not a good idea to be evacuating people because you ’re putting other people at a potential risk . 
That ’s my personal opinion and I 'm not a medical personnel , " he said . 
" As I understand you have a 14 day incubation period and putting them on a plane with recycled air and there is a danger of infecting other people . "
