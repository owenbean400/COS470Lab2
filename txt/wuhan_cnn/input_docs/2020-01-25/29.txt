Fifty six Indian students have been trapped in Wuhan for three days , with some afraid to leave their dorm room and fearful of running out of food . 
Ganesan Deepshikha , a student at the Wuhan University School Of Medicine , told CNN that the students have been told by the Indian Embassy that they are safe in Wuhan but have not received any assistance . 
Normally a transport hub for central China , Wuhan has been closed off from the rest of the country since Thursday -- when the city was placed on lockdown . 
Public transport has been shut down and car travel restricted . 
Deepshikha told CNN that 25 to 30 among the group of Indian students at the Wuhan University are refusing to leave their dorm room , despite having only enough food for one more day . 
Two campus hospitals at the Wuhan University have been treating patients suffering from Wuhan coronavirus -- with one such hospital just 300 meters from the dorm where the Indian students have sequestered themselves .
