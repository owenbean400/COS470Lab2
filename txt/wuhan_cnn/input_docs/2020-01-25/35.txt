The US consulate reached out to Americans registered with the consulate and offered them seats on a flight , which will have medical personnel on board , according to a US official with knowledge of the matter . 
There are about 1,000 Americans living in Wuhan and those who choose to evacuate with diplomats will be billed for the flight , the source said . 
He disputed the Wall Street Journal 's description that " any available seats might be offered to non US citizens and diplomats of other nations , " saying that non US citizens would only be allowed to take the flight if they are related or married to Americans . 
He added that other diplomats from countries such as South Korea and the United Kingdom are arranging their own transportation out of Wuhan . 
He also said the WSJ description of the aircraft size was not entirely accurate as officials were still deciding between a narrow body Boeing 737 and a wide body Boeing 767 .
