The Wuhan New type Coronavirus Pneumonia Command -- a task force set up to deal with the crisis -- said in a statement that Wuhan has a sufficient supply and reserve of food , medical supplies and commodities . 
" There is no need for the general public of the city to panic or hoard in order to prevent unnecessary wastes , " the command said . 
However , there is still unease among many in the city . 
Jan Renders , a 29 year old Ph D student in Wuhan , told CNN that many shops are closing for the Lunar New Year holiday , so many people had already been stocking up on supplies . 
Renders , who has lived in Wuhan for the last two and a half months , said he was able to stock up on food for at least a week . 
" But of course people are not sure whether shops will be going back to normal soon , " he said . 
Another man in Wuhan sent CNN a picture inside a grocery store Thursday morning that showed several empty shelves . 
The man , who asked not to be identified , said most of the food was sold out .
