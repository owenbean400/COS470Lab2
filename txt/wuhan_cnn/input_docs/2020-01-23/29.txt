Wuhan , the city where the outbreak originated , is home to more than 11 million people -- that 's as big , or bigger than London , the largest city by population in the European Union . 
It 's the biggest city in all of central China -- and unsurprisingly , is considered the political , economic and transport capital of the region . 
Located in Hubei province on the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary , the Han River , the city is often referred to as " jiu sheng tong qu , " meaning it 's considered the main thoroughfare of nine provinces . 
In other words , Wuhan is huge and densely populated , with people coming and going every day -- making the outbreak and lockdown a nightmare for authorities , especially ahead of Lunar New Year this weekend . 
To put it in perspective : The lockdown is like closing down all transportation for a city more than three times the size of Chicago , two days before Christmas .
