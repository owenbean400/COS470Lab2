A senior State Department official said Wednesday the United States is concerned about transparency inside the Chinese government on the Wuhan Coronavirus . 
" I do believe that the concern you see both inside China and internationally is a reflection of what we â€™ve seen in the past . 2003 was SARS , and a number of issues , where the government has been slow to respond out of fear of embarrassment or making things look worse than they are . 
And that reluctance to respond in a rapid manner does not give the global community a secure feeling for this being managed inside China , " the official said . 
The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) looms large over China 's response to the Wuhan coronavirus . 
Hundreds of people died of SARS , and Chinese authorities were widely criticized for initially downplaying the severity of the disease and censoring news about its spread , potentially causing many more people to become infected . 
The State Department official said that the US was in contact with " the folks in Wuhan and the Ambassador in Beijing " on this . 
They said there is discussion about raising the travel advisory in response to the Wuhan Coronavirus , but nothing had been formally announced yet . 
Tarik Jasarevic , a spokesman for the World Health Organization , said Chinese authorities conducted genetic sequencing of the virus days after the first reported cases and then shared the sequence with the global health community . 
On its verified Twitter account , the Chinese Embassy in the United States says , " China has shared info with WHO and other countries and regions on 15 occasions . "
