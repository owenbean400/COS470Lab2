Chinese officials praised the country 's response to the coronavirus crisis at a news conference today -- but sidestepped questions about the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang . 
The virus , which has killed 636 people in mainland China , can be " prevented , contained , and cured , " said Xie Feng , commissioner of China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong . 
He emphasized China 's speed in responding to the outbreak , claiming " governments at all levels in China were immediately mobilized . " 
Fact check : In the weeks after the virus was first detected , authorities clamped down with knee jerk censorship . 
Communist Party officials downplayed the severity of the virus , police targeted " rumormongers " like Li Wenliang , and online censors deleted anything that questioned the official line . 
As the crisis has worsened , it has become clear that the failure to take quick action likely undermined any chance of containing the virus . 
On Li Wenliang : When asked whether the government should apologize for the death of Li Wenliang , Xie Feng did not answer directly , only reading out a brief statement from the Wuhan government that expressed " deepest condolences " to Li 's family . 
On censorship : Despite heavy anger from the Chinese public against the government and its censors , Xie Feng claimed there was freedom of speech in mainland China .
