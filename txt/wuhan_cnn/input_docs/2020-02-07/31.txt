A new study turns a spotlight on the possible risk of hospital related transmissions of the Wuhan coronavirus . 
The study , published in the medical journal JAMA today , involved analyzing data on 138 patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus infected pneumonia in Wuhan , China . 
The data showed that hospital related transmissions of the virus were suspected in about 41 % of the patients . 
Specifically , 40 health care workers in the study and 17 patients who were already hospitalized for other reasons were presumed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the hospital , the data showed , also revealing that 26 % of all the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit and 4.3 % died . 
The researchers noted that the new study , to their knowledge , might be the largest case series to date of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus infected pneumonia â€” but the study had some limitations . 
Hospital related transmissions of infections " could not be definitively proven but was suspected and presumed based on timing and patterns of exposure to infected patients and subsequent development of infection , " the researchers wrote in the study . 
Among the 138 cases , " most patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission . 
Therefore , it is difficult to assess risk factors for poor outcome , and continued observations of the natural history of the disease are needed , " they wrote .
