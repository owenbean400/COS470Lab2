China 's social media channels were awash with anger following news of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang 's death . 
The topics " Wuhan government owes Dr . Li Wenliang an apology , " and " We want freedom of speech , " quickly trended on China 's Twitter like platform , Weibo . 
Each gained tens of thousands of views before disappearing from the heavily censored platform . 
Another topic , called " I want freedom of speech , " had drawn 1.8 million views as of early Friday morning local time . 
Why this matters : The outpouring of grief and anger was made worse by initial confusion . 
State media first published then retracted reports of his death -- leading to allegations they were trying to cover it up . 
The push against Chinese censors and calls for freedom are rarely seen -- under Chinese President Xi Jinping , control over the media and internet has increased , and tolerance for dissent has practically disappeared . 
Anger in China against the authorities , and their handling of the crisis , had already been growing for weeks . 
Now , Li 's death could become the straw that breaks the camel 's back .
