China 's National Supervisory Commission , the country 's top anti corruption agency , is sending a team to Wuhan to investigate the case of doctor Li Wenliang " in response to issues raised by the masses , " the agency said today . 
The brief statement did not elaborate on the " issues " -- but a glance on Weibo , China 's Twitter like platform , reveal what these may be . 
A whistleblower silenced : Li died late Thursday night from the coronavirus , after sounding the alarm on the outbreak in December . 
He was targeted by police and labeled a " rumor monger , " and later was diagnosed with the virus . 
His death was met with extreme grief and rare fury online . 
Weibo users have flooded the platform with calls for accountability , greater freedom of speech , and an apology from the Wuhan government .
