Nearly half a million residents in the Chinese city where the novel coronavirus first emerged may have been infected with Covid 19 -- almost 10 times its official number of confirmed cases , according to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 
The study used a sample of 34,000 people in the general population in Wuhan -- the original epicenter of the pandemic -- and other cities in Hubei province , as well as Beijing , Shanghai , and the provinces of Guangdong , Jiangsu , Sichuan and Liaoning to estimate Covid 19 infection rates . 
The study aimed to estimate the scale of past infections in a population by testing blood serum samples from a pool of people for coronavirus antibodies . 
Its findings are not taken to be final statistics of how many people in a given area have been exposed to the virus . 
The Chinese CDC said the study was conducted a month after China " contained the first wave of the Covid 19 epidemic . " 
The prevalence rate outside of Wuhan is significantly lower , the study showed . 
In other cities in Hubei , only 0.44 % of residents surveyed were found to have coronavirus antibodies . 
Outside the province , antibodies were only detected in two people among the more than 12,000 residents surveyed . 
The results of the study were revealed in a Chinese CDC post on social media Monday . 
It did not mention whether the study has been published in academic journals .
