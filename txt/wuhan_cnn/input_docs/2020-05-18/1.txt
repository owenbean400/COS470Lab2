The Chinese city of Wuhan has conducted more than 400,000 nucleic acids tests within the first three days of a citywide campaign to test all residents for Covid 19 , the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said today . 
The testing drive comes after several new local cases were reported this month , sparking concern that the coronavirus could still be spreading in the city of 11 million people , where the virus emerged at the end of last year . 
The number of tests conducted daily has also steadily increased from 72,791 on May 14 -- when the campaign began -- to 222,675 on May 16 , local health authorities said . 
Who is being tested ? 
The Wuhan government said that the citywide tests will apply to most permanent and temporary residents who were never tested before , and will exclude children under the age of 6 . 
How will it work ? 
The tests are conducted free of charge , and only those who test positive will be notified by authorities , the local government said . 
All samples will be stored in a secure and independent server to safeguard privacy , authorities added . 
Last Thursday , leading Chinese business publication Caixin reported that Wuhan will carry out the citywide testing in waves . 
Over a period of 10 days , each district will stagger their tests in an effort to prevent a resurgence of the virus .
