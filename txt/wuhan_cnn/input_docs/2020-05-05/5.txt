There 's new evidence that the coronavirus may have been in France weeks earlier than was previously thought . 
Doctors at a Paris hospital say they 've found evidence that one patient admitted in December was infected with Covid 19 . 
If verified , this finding would show that the virus was already circulating in Europe at that time â€” well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy . 
" Covid 19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019 , a month before the official first cases in the country , " the team at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine in Saint Denis wrote in a study published Sunday in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents . 
The first official reports of Covid 19 in France were reported on Jan . 24 , in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan , China . 
Intensive care specialist Dr . Yves Cohen and his hospital colleagues wrote that they decided to check the records of earlier patients , in case the virus had been spreading undetected . 
The French team looked at people admitted to the hospital with flu like illnesses between Dec . 2 and Jan . 16 who were not subsequently diagnosed with influenza . 
The doctors re tested samples stored in a freezer for coronavirus . 
One sample , taken from a 42 year old man born in Algeria , who lived in France , tested positive . 
" His last trip was in Algeria during August 2019 , " they wrote . 
The man had not been to China , and one of his children had also been sick , the team reported .
