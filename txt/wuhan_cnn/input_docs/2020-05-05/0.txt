Doctors at a Paris hospital claim to have found evidence a patient who got sick in December was infected with the novel coronavirus . 
If verified , it may show the virus was circulating in Europe as early as December . 
The first reports of Covid 19 in France were reported on January 24 , in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan , China . 
Yves Cohen and colleagues at the Paris hospital decided to check the records of patients who got sick before the January 24 cases to see if the virus may have been spreading undetected earlier than first thought . 
The French team looked at people admitted to the hospital with flu like illnesses between December 2 and January 16 who were not subsequently diagnosed with influenza . 
The doctors re tested samples stored in a freezer for coronavirus . 
Remember : This claim has not yet been independently verified . 
Europe did not start reporting cases of coronavirus until January . 
In Italy , the European country hit hardest by the virus , the first two cases were reported on January 31 , in two Chinese tourists in Rome . 
The first known community transmission was recorded in February in Codogno , in northern Italy .
