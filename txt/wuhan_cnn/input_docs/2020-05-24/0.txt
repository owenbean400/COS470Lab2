Wang Yanyi , the director of Wuhan Virology Institute , told Chinese state media CGTN that the institute did not have any knowledge of or encountered the coronavirus that caused this Covid 19 pandemic before December 30 last year , when they received its first clinical sample . 
" We did not have any knowledge before that , nor had we ever encountered , researched or kept the virus . 
In fact , like everyone else , we did not even know the virus existed . 
How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it ? " she said . 
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been caught up in speculation that the virus was leaked from its laboratory -- a claim that was promoted by US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo . 
The claim has drawn fierce rebuttal from the Chinese government , which described the accusation as " smear " intended to bolster Trump 's reelection chances . 
Wang also refuted assertions that the pandemic was caused by two other novel coronaviruses originating from bats that the institute had carried out research on , one of which has a 96.2 % similarity with the SARS Co V 2 . 
She said although from the perspective of many non professionals , the similarity rate of 96.2 percent is fairly high , " In the natural world , it takes a long period of time for a virus to naturally evolve and mutate to become SARS Co V 2 , " she added .
