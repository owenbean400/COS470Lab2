The Director General of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has called on countries not to impose travel and trade restrictions over the coronavirus , warning that such measures could increase " fear and stigma " within the international community . 
" Where such measures have been implemented , we urge that they are short in duration , proportionate to the public health risks , and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves , " he added . 
He also called on member states to " facilitate rapid collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop the diagnostics , medicines and vaccines , " in order to bring the outbreak under control . 
Ghebreyesus asked member states to share information with the health body , " including epidemiological , clinical severity and the results of community studies and investigations , " because without such data it is difficult for the WHO to assess the evolution of the outbreak . 
" The risk of [ Wuhan coronavirus ] becoming more widespread globally remains high . 
Now is the moment for all countries to be preparing themselves , " he added .
