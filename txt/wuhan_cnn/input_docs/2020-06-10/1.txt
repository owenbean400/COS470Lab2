The Chinese government has removed pangolin scales from its 2020 list of approved ingredients used in traditional Chinese medicine , a move campaigners describe as a " critical step " towards saving the world 's most trafficked mammal . 
According to Chinese state run media Tuesday , the latest edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia -- an official government compendium of drugs covering traditional Chinese and Western medicines -- no longer includes pangolin scales on the list of approved ingredients , owing to " wild resources exhaustion . " 
The latest move to protect pangolins comes in the wake of new research that suggests pangolins kept in wildlife markets across China may have helped incubate the novel coronavirus before it spread to humans . 
The virus has now infected more than 7 million people across the world since it was detected last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan , including at least 84,000 cases in mainland China . 
According to a team of researchers from Duke University and Los Alamos National Laboratory , the virus swapped genes repeatedly with similar strains infecting bats , pangolins and a possible third species prior to jumping to humans . 
The researchers concluded that although it was too soon to blame pangolins for the pandemic , it was clear that people must reduce their contact with wild animals that can transmit new infections . 
Following the outbreak , the Chinese government outlawed the consumption of all wild animals countrywide in an effort to avoid further deadly outbreaks .
