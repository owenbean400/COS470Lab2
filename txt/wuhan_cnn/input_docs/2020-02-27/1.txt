A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time , Osaka 's prefecture government said on Wednesday . 
The first case of reinfection to be reported in the country comes amid mounting fears over the spread of coronavirus there . 
The number of confirmed cases in Japan has risen to more than 800 -- nearly 700 of which were reported on a cruise liner quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month -- and seven people have died . 
The 40 year old woman , an Osaka resident , tested positive on Wednesday after developing chest pains and a sore throat , the prefectural government said in a statement . 
She first tested positive in late January and was discharged from hospital on February 1 , after being treated for symptoms at a hospital in Osaka . 
The Japanese Ministry of Health guidelines state that coronavirus patients must get tested twice before their release . 
The woman had contact with tourists from Wuhan while working as a tour guide in mid January . 
An Osaka prefectural official told CNN that she did not attend work , wore a mask at all times and did not have close contact with anyone while she was not in a medical facility .
