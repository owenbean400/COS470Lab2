CNN is first to report that two airline passengers flew to the United States while actively sick with Wuhan coronavirus , but passengers who sat near them did not become ill , according to a spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
The sick passengers are among the 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US . 
It ’s significant that they were ill on the flights , since health authorities say people who are actively ill are most likely to infect others . 
The two sick passengers traveled from China to Los Angeles International Airport on January 20 and January 22 . 
The 14 day incubation period for the virus has since passed , so it ’s believed that other people who were on the flights are no longer at risk for contracting the illness . 
Health authorities got in touch with passengers who flew in the same rows as the sick passengers as well those in the two rows in front and behind . 
Local health officials told those passengers to look out for the symptoms of the coronavirus , including fever , coughing and trouble breathing . 
In addition to the nine travel related cases of Wuhan coronavirus , two person to person cases have been confirmed in the United States , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 11 .
