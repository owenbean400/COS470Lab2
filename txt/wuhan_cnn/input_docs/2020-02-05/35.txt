General Motors CEO Mary Barra told investors today that the company ’s " thoughts and focus has been our people , " but added that they 're working with their Chinese partner and health authorities to make sure their supply chain is not disrupted . 
GM has a large manufacturing plant in Wuhan — ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak . 
The plant employs nearly 6,000 people , about 10 % of GM 's total work force in China . 
The most interesting coronavirus wrinkle from GM is that the president of GM China , Matt Tsien , flew in last week to participate in today ’s investor conference . 
But due to " an abundance of caution , " he 's participating by calling in rather than speaking in person . 
Ford also had little hard info about the coronavirus on its own earnings call on Tuesday . 
CEO Jim Hackett said the Ford team is " proactively monitoring the situation on several fronts , including the safety of our employees and their families . 
This is paramount . " 
Hackett added that Ford is also monitoring their supply chain , but that its " too early " to tell the effect the coronavirus will have on its business . 
Last week : Ford banned travel to , from and inside China , telling employees who had traveled there to quarantine themselves for 14 days after returning .
