The coronavirus outbreak began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan , capital of Hubei province in December . 
Now , it has spread across the province , with two other cities in Hubei reporting over 1,000 cases and scores of deaths . 
The three cities : Wuhan : 8,351 cases , including 362 deaths Huanggang : 1,645 cases , including 25 deaths Xiaogan : 1,462 cases , including 18 deaths There are fears in the region that Huanggang and Xiaogan could become " the next Wuhan " -- exacerbated by the fact that they have less public health infrastructure than Wuhan , which is a major urban hub . 
Drastic measures : Authorities in these areas have implemented drastic measures to try and limit the spread of the virus . 
In Huanggang , officials are only allowing one representative from each household to leave their home every other day to go outside and buy groceries . 
Apart from the designated representative , the only other people allowed out of their homes are people seeking medical attention , or working in virus control , pharmacies and supermarkets . 
The city government said the measure was to minimize the flow of people in the city .
