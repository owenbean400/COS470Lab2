The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is not a pandemic , World Health Organization officials said Tuesday , adding that they 're hopeful transmission of the virus can be contained . 
The agency acknowledges that it is challenging to contain the virus because of global mass movement . 
" We are not in a pandemic , " said WHO official Sylvie Briand , explaining that the virus is currently considered to be an epidemic with multiple locations . 
" We will try to extinguish the transmission in each of these , " she said , adding that the agency believes this " can be done with containment measures currently in place . " 
Pandemic vs . epidemic : A pandemic is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease , but it 's not quite as simple as that . 
Many factors , including population immunity and disease severity , need to be taken into account . 
An epidemic is more than a normal number cases of an illness , specific health related behavior or other health related events in a community or region . 
A disease outbreak is the occurrence of disease cases in excess of what 's normally expected , according to WHO .
