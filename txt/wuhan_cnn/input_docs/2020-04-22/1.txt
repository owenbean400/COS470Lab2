Lockdowns restricting travel and industry imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus have resulted in unprecedented reductions in deadly air pollution around the world , new analysis shows . 
Major cities that suffer from the world 's worst air pollution have seen reductions of deadly particulate matter by up to 60 % from the previous year , during a three week lockdowns period . 
Researchers from IQAir -- a global air quality information and tech company -- studied 10 major cities around the world which have relatively high numbers of coronavirus cases and Covid 19 lockdown measures . 
The study compared levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5 . 
The pollutant , which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter , is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream , causing serious health risks . 
Seven out of the 10 cities studied , including New Delhi , Seoul , Wuhan and Mumbai , saw significant improvements in air quality . 
Those with historically higher levels of PM2.5 pollution witnessed the most substantial drops in pollution .
