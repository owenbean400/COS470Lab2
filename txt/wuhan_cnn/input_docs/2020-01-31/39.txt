Magnified images of cells infected with the Wuhan coronavirus were released Friday by scientists at the University of Hong Kong , who are studying samples of the virus to better understand how it might replicate . 
Thin section electron micrographs of the novel coronavirus show a portion of the infected cells , with viral particles being released from the surface ( the round dots lined up on the edge ) . 
Dr . John Nicholls , a clinical professor in pathology at the university , told CNN that this shows " the cell is a very efficient virus producing factory . " 
The cells were infected with a patient sample from Hong Kong . 
" It allows us to see how this virus is replicating in cells and whether it is any different to MERS or SARS in the way it replicates , " Nicholls said . 
" If this virus uses the same replication mechanisms as SARS and MERS , then we can use our existing SARS and MERS information and apply it to the new corona viruses . "
