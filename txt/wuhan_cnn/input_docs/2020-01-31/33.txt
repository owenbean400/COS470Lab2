China has chartered two flights to Southeast Asia to pick up stranded Chinese travelers from Hubei Province , the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus that has spread across the globe . 
Arranged by the government , two Boeing 737-800 jets took off from the southeastern city of Xiamen on Friday afternoon , bound for Bangkok , Thailand , and Kota Kinabalu , Malaysia , according to a statement from the Civil Aviation Administration of China ( CAAC ) . 
The charter flights are expected to bring 217 Hubei residents stranded in the two locations back to Wuhan , the provincial capital of Hubei , on Friday night , CAAC said . 
The statement added that passengers would be billed for their flight . 
Technically flights into Wuhan are allowed but all departures are banned -- except special flights , such as evacuation flights . 
But almost all airlines have canceled their Wuhan flights ( both international and domestic ) , making it nearly impossible for these travelers to find alternative flights home .
