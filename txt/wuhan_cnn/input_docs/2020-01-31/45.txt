Two flights chartered by the Chinese government have brought stranded travelers from Hubei Province , epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak , back home from Thailand and Malaysia . 
The Xiamen Airlines operated flights landed at the international airport of Wuhan , the provincial capital of Hubei , on Friday night , according to the Chinese foreign ministry and flight data . 
The foreign ministry said the flight from Bangkok , Thailand , carried 76 passengers . 
It is unclear how many people were aboard the flight from Kota Kinabalu , Malaysia . 
The authorities had earlier said that the two flights were expected to bring back more than 200 Hubei residents . 
Arranged by the government , two Boeing 737-800 jets took off from the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen on Friday afternoon , according to a statement from the Civil Aviation Administration of China ( CAAC ) . 
The statement added that passengers would be billed for their flight . 
About flying to Wuhan : Technically , flights into Wuhan are allowed but all departures are banned â€” except special flights , such as evacuation flights . 
But almost all airlines have canceled their Wuhan flights , both international and domestic , making it nearly impossible for stranded travelers to find alternative flights home .
