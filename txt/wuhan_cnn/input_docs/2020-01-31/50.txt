There have been more than 9,800 cases of Wuhan coronavirus globally as of Friday afternoon . 
Most of those cases have been documented in mainland China . 
Correction : A previous version of this post contained a map that misattributed the source of provincial coronavirus case totals . 
The data comes from each province ’s health authority , not China ’s National Health Commission . 
The sourcing for the graphic above it has also been clarified .
