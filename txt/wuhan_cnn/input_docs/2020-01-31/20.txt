One week , a dozen countries and almost 200 more deaths after initially declining to declare the Wuhan virus a global health emergency , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on Thursday did just that . 
Following a meeting of its emergency committee in Geneva , the WHO agreed " that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern " ( PHEIC ) . 
Before this week , a PHEIC has been declared five times , for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemics , twice in 2014 for polio and Ebola , the 2016 Zika virus outbreak , and for the 2018 Ebola outbreak . 
Is this significant ? 
While the decision was headline news -- and the failure to do so earlier had attracted considerable criticism -- it is largely a political move , a signal to governments around the world to take this outbreak seriously if they were not already and reminder to them of their WHO commitments . 
The statement added that " all countries " should be prepared for additional measures , and that they are legally required to share information with the WHO under the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) . 
Some background : The IHR was introduced in 2005 and agreed upon by 196 countries around the world -- but the agreement is largely toothless . 
Recommendations , even under a PHEIC , are typically non binding . 
There are also no in built sanctions or punishments for states failing to comply with their obligations under the IHR , many of which rely on governments to self report their progress . 
There are also concerns " that Emergency Committees are influenced by politics rather than strictly reviewing scientific evidence , " wrote several medical law experts in The Lancet in 2015 .
