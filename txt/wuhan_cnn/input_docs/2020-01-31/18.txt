When Justin Steece , an American citizen in Wuhan , walked through his neighborhood on Thursday , it was eerily empty and quiet . 
" Normally it is very , very bustling around here and you always see at least 20 , 30 people in my neighborhood walking around , " he said in a video documenting the walk . 
" You 'll see thousands and thousands of cars on the street at any one time . " 
Steece 's wife is Chinese , and they have a one month old baby , but they 've had trouble getting out of Wuhan . 
His wife does not have a visa to go to the US -- it would take months to process the paperwork -- and his baby does not have a passport . 
They are now trying to get on the next US evacuation flight out of Wuhan , scheduled for February 3 , but they do not have any confirmation or clear resolution in sight .
