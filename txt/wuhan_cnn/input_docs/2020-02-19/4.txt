Scientists around the world are slamming and debunking conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus has its origins not in animals , but in a Chinese laboratory , according to a statement published Wednesday in the medical journal The Lancet . 
" We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID 19 does not have a natural origin , " wrote the 27 authors , citing studies from scientists in multiple countries that have analyzed the virus â€™ genetic makeup . 
These studies " overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife , as have so many other emerging pathogens . " 
CNN previously reported statements by Sen . 
Tom Cotton of Arkansas this week on Fox News , who said " this virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market " and implied it may have started in a laboratory not far away . 
" We do not have evidence that this disease originated there ... but we at least have to ask the question , " Cotton said . 
In the newly published statement , the scientists said : " Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear , rumours , and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus . "
