A study published Friday in the medical journal JAMA found that 41 % of the first 138 patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan , China , were presumed to be infected in that hospital . 
This is big news . 
In plain English , it means that nearly half of the initial infections in this hospital appear to have been spread within the hospital itself . 
This is called nosocomial transmission . 
( Doctors use big words to hide bad things : Nosocomial means caught it in the hospital . ) 
What 's more , most spread does not appear to have been the result of a so called " super spreader event , " in which a single patient transmits infection to many other people . 
In these events , a procedure such as bronchoscopy -- where a doctor inserts a tube into the patient 's lungs -- can result in many infections . 
This would be a concern , but not nearly as much as what appears to have happened : Many health care workers and many patients got infected in many parts of the hospital . 
What 's more , since there 's a broad spectrum of infection and only patients who were sick were tested , it 's quite likely that there was even more transmission in the hospital . 
So , like SARS and MERS -- other coronaviruses -- before it , the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading in hospitals .
