Everyone !

Rise in tourism appeal : As the original epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak , Wuhan implemented a 76 day lockdown from January 23 to April 8 . 
Not only did the lockdown slow infection rates significantly -- the city has not reported a local case since May -- but it surprisingly boosted the city 's appeal . 
According to a joint study carried out in April by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Tourism Research Center and Tencent Culture and Tourism Industry Research Center , Wuhan was the top destination Chinese citizens wanted to visit after the crisis subsided .
