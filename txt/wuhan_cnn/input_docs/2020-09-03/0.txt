Thailand has reported zero locally transmitted cases of Covid 19 for 100 days , marking a significant milestone in the battle against the coronavirus only a small number of countries around the world have achieved . 
But the Thai government is also facing growing pressure from businesses to reopen borders to international tourists , as months of travel restrictions have devastated its heavily tourism dependent economy . 
The Southeast Asian country has not recorded any local infections since late May . 
It is still finding coronavirus cases in overseas arrivals , who are subjected to a mandatory 14 day quarantine period . 
Patients remain in quarantine until they 've recovered . 
So far , the country of 70 million people has a caseload of just 3,427 , with 58 deaths . 
More than 28 % of the reported infections are overseas cases , according to the Health Ministry . 
Thailand was the first country to detect the coronavirus outside China , confirming its first case on January 13 -- a Chinese tourist who had flown to Bangkok from Wuhan . 
The country had first refrained from banning Chinese tourists , but in late March , when its caseload surged close to 1,000 , the Thai government declared a state of emergency and banned all non resident foreigners from entering . 
The border closure has helped protect the country while the virus rages across the world , but it has also dealt a huge blow to its tourist sector , which according to the World Bank normally contributes close to 15 % of Thailand 's GDP . 
In June , the Tourism Council of Thailand said it expected to see an estimated 8 million foreign tourists this year , an 80 % drop from last year 's record number of 39.8 million . 
Thailand 's economy shrank 12.2 % in the second quarter of this year , its worst in 22 years since the Asian financial crisis in 1998 .
