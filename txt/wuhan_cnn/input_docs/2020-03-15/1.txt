Life in China is beginning to return to normal now that the coronavirus outbreak has largely been contained across the country , with lockdowns lifting and employees returning to work . 
China only reported 20 new cases today -- a drastic drop from just a few weeks ago , when the country was recording thousands of new infections a day . 
The new cases are no longer spread out across the country -- now , new cases are mostly either imported from international travelers or concentrated in Hubei Province , the epicenter of the outbreak . 
Domestic travel is resuming : During the worst of the outbreak , 1,119 highway entrances and exits across the country were closed . 
Now , all but two have reopened , according to state media outlet Xinhua . 
Hundreds of previously closed roads in counties , towns , and provinces have also reopened . 
The national road network is " basically running normally , " and 28 provinces have resumed inter provincial travel , Xinhua reported . 
Of 12,028 health and quarantine stations set up on highways , 11,198 have been removed . 
This is a huge contrast to February . 
Just a month ago , much of China was essentially locked down . 
Many residents were not allowed to leave their apartment complexes , let alone the city . 
Some stayed indoors for weeks on end . 
Even within cities , public transport was restricted ; in Wuhan and other locked down cities , subway trains were halted and most taxis suspended , with only a small number of government issued shuttles and cars operating .
