Chinese President Xi Jinping knew about the coronavirus outbreak in early January , he said in a speech this month . 
According to a transcript of the speech made on February 3 , and published in the Communist Party journal Qiushi on Saturday , Xi " issued requirements for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus " on January 7 . 
Previously , Xi was believed to only have learned about the extent and danger of the outbreak in late January , when he publicly intervened to order " all out efforts " to tackle its spread . 
" I have , at all times , monitored the spread of the epidemic and the progress in prevention and control work , and continue to give oral orders and instructions , " Xi said . 
While the speech underlines that Xi has been personally directing the response to the outbreak -- something that has been repeatedly emphasized in state media -- the revelation that he knew about the virus when Wuhan officials were publicly downplaying its danger , exposes him to the risk of being blamed , along with them , for failing to properly handle the outbreak in its early weeks .
