South Korea has reported three new deaths from people who had the novel coronavirus - - taking the national toll to 31 . 
This comes as health authorities announced that they are looking into two Shincheonji religious group members who traveled to South Korea in January from Wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak in China . 
Kwon Joon wook , vice director of South Korea â€™s Center for Disease Control and Prevention , told a press briefing that one member tested negative while the other tested positive for the virus . 
However , the positive case was confirmed late February and it will be difficult to establish whether that second case influenced the massive transmission among Shincheonji members , Kwon added .
