The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide surpassed 10 million on Sunday , according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University . 
The terrible milestone comes six months after initial cases were first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in mid December , before continuing to spread across the globe . 
Covid 19 has infected 10,001,527 and killed at least 499,123 people globally . 
The figure comes as numerous countries like the UK ease lockdown restrictions , yet the pandemic continues to course through nations . 
Countries like Germany , which effectively handled the first wave , are seeing an uptick in new infections -- a problem that experts say will recur until a vaccine is found . 
Other countries are seeing more than 10,000 infections a day . 
In India , authorities are scrambling to open a Covid 19 treatment facility to deal with the surge in cases in the nation 's capital , New Delhi . 
The US leads with the most deaths and confirmed cases worldwide . 
There are at least 2,510,323 coronavirus cases and 125,539 deaths from the disease in the country . 
After managing to slow the spread in May , coronavirus numbers have skyrocketed in inland states , including Texas and Arizona . 
Now only two US states are reporting a decline in new cases compared to last week -- Connecticut and Rhode Island . 
Florida reported 9,585 new coronavirus cases Saturday , a single day record high since the start of the pandemic . 
The number rivals that of New York 's peak in daily cases in early April .
