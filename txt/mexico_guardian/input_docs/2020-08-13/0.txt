Mexico plans to extend the closure of its shared border with the United States for another month to non essential travel , Mexico ’s foreign affairs secretary , Marcelo Ebrard , said . 
The current agreement runs through 21 August , but Ebrard said it does not make sense to reopen the border at this time . 
" We already told the United States that we ’re of the idea that it ’s extended because of what we have along the strip on their side , " Ebrard said , referring to a surge in cases in the south western United States . 
The travel restriction at the shared land border was first announced on 18 March and has been renewed monthly . 
It has included the US Canada border as well . 
" The border could not be opened right now , " Ebrard said . 
" It would not be logical that we change it right now , so it will be another month . " 
Mexico has reported about 500,000 confirmed Covid 19 infections and about 55,000 deaths , both considered to be significant undercounts due to very limited testing .
