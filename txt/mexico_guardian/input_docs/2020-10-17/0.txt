Marigolds , known in Mexico as " the flower of the dead " for a scent believed be strong and sweet enough to attract souls and draw them back , are generally all around by mid October as the Day of the Dead approaches . 
But with the country exceeding 85,700 official deaths from the coronavirus pandemic this year , the bright , orange color has not been as prominent as Mexican authorities have said cemeteries will remain closed for the 2 November celebration , Reuters reports . 
" There have been a lot of losses this year , " said Concepcion Cruz , who cultivates marigold in Mexico City . 
She said only about half as many of the flowers are being grown this year as would have been planted normally for the annual holiday . 
Ratcheting back the celebrations is a sacrifice that must be made if Mexico is to curb the spread of the pandemic , said Columba Lopez , director of Mexico City ’s Commission for Natural Resources and Rural Development . 
" People have to stay at home , " he added . 
The Day of the Dead tradition blends Catholic rituals with the pre Hispanic belief that the dead return once a year from the underworld . 
Cemeteries , public gardens and houses light up in the bright , orange color as marigolds are planted everywhere in October . 
In their homes , Mexicans build altars adorned with photographs of the deceased , marigolds , candy skulls , papier mâché skeletons and chocolate coffins . 
The dead are also offered their favourite food , pastries , tequila and cigarettes - or whatever might entice them to return from the underworld . 
With cemeteries closed but more dead to remember this year , Mexicans are planning more private remembrances for their loved ones .
