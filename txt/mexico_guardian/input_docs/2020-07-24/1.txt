The mayor of Mexico City has warned of a possible resurgence of cases in the sprawling capital in the coming months , noting that hospitalisations have been on the rise in recent days . 
Reuters reports that Mexico City and its surrounding areas , home to more than 20 million people , have been the epicentre of the country ’s epidemic after infections were first detected in late February . 
Cases began to level off in mid June , but authorities now fear that downward trend could reverse . 
The mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said hospitalisations have increased in the last five days . 
At this rate , she cautioned , hospitalisation levels by October could exceed those registered in June , at the height of the pandemic . 
" It is important to recognise that , if we do not change the trend , there could be exponential growth " in cases , she said . 
Mexico City ’s government began relaxing lockdown measures on 15 June , leading to the reopening of the dense and bustling historical centre , along with shopping centres and restaurants . 
In addition , thousands of factory workers have returned to their jobs . 
Mexico reported 8,438 new cases on Thursday , its greatest single day increase , bringing the total number of infections to 370,712 . 
The country , which has the fourth highest death toll of any country , has registered 41,908 fatalities .
