Britain ’s health secretary Matt Hancock will announce this week that Public Health England ( PHE ) will be scrapped and replaced by a new body specifically designed to protect England against a pandemic by early next month , the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported . 
Hancock will announce a merger of the pandemic response work of PHE with NHS test and trace into a new body , called the National Institute for Health Protection , the newspaper said . 
The paper said the new body will become " effective " next month , although it will take until next spring to complete . 
The Conservative peer and former Talk Talk telecoms boss Baroness Harding , who currently heads Test and Trace , is being tipped to lead the organisation , the paper said . 
It quoted a senior minister as saying : " We want to bring together the science and the scale in one new body so we can do all we can to stop a second coronavirus spike this autumn . " 
The reported move follows repeated reports over recent months that ministers have been unhappy and frustrated with PHE ’s response to the coronavirus crisis . 
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said : " Public Health England have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic . 
" We have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position , both as we continue to deal with Covid 19 and to respond to any future public health threat . "
