France is to propose that masks be worn in shared workspaces as the country grapples with a rebound in coronavirus cases that rose again in the past 24 hours to over 3,000 . 
Employment minister Elisabeth Borne said she would propose on Tuesday at talks with employer and union representatives that masks be compulsory in collective workspaces . 
" A theme that appears in all scientific opinions is the value of wearing them [ masks ] when there are several people in a confined space , " Borne said in an interview with French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche . 
Doctors have increasingly called for masks to be required in the workplace while the HCSP , a body advising the government on health policy , issued a recommendation calling for masks to be compulsory in all common indoor spaces .
