Mexico added back 52,455 jobs in August , president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Saturday , hailing the news as a sign of recovery after the country lost more than 1 million jobs in the formal economy due to the coronavirus pandemic . 
" This is a good indicator ... 
We ’re going to move ahead in spite of everything because we ’re working in a professional manner , " he said in a video on Twitter , citing data from the Mexican Social Security Institute ( IMSS ) on employees registered with the institute . 
IMSS said last week that 3,907 jobs were lost in July due to the pandemic , adding to 1.1 million jobs lost in the country between March and June , according to Reuters . 
Mexico ranks third worldwide for most coronavirus fatalities , with a death toll of 55,908 , and its economy is expected to shrink this year by as much as 10 % or more .
