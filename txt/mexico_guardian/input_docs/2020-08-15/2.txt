South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday that all indications were that South Africa had reached the peak of Covid 19 infections , as he announced a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy . 
In a televised address , Ramaphosa said the government would end the ban on alcohol and tobacco , allow restaurants and taverns to return to normal business , subject to strict hygiene regulations , and remove the ban on travel between provinces . 
" All indications are that South Africa has reached the peak and moved beyond the inflection point of the curve , " Ramaphosa said , adding that the cabinet had decided to move to lower , " level two " restrictions from midnight on Monday . 
" The move to level two means that we can remove nearly all of the restrictions on the resumption of economic activity across most industries , " he said . 
He said a fall in the infection rates , as well as people recovering , were " significantly reducing the pressure on our health facilities " , but he cautioned that cases could easily surge if people fail to maintain vigilance . 
Restrictions on international travel remained in place , he said . 
South Africa has more than half a million cases , but the rate of infections has declined over the past two weeks .
