Greek authorities have announced 230 new coronavirus cases over the past day , 27 from international arrivals , the daily I Kathimerini reported . 
There were also 3 new deaths . 
Total Covid 19 cases in Greece now stand at 6,858 with 226 deaths . 
There are 23 patients on ventilators , while 136 have recovered after having been treated in intensive care units . 
The sharp rise in new daily cases in August , and local outbreaks coinciding with the late opening of the tourist season after two months of strict lockdown , have led the government to impose new social distancing measures and restrictions . 
From Monday , bars , cafes and restaurants in many parts of the country , including the capital Athens , will have to close at midnight and not reopen before 7am .
