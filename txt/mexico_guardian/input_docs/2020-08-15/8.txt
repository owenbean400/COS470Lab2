Sir Keir Starmer has warned Boris Johnson it is his duty to ensure schools in England reopen in September as planned . 
Writing in the Mail on Sunday , the Labour leader said it was essential for the wellbeing and life chances of children that they were able to return to normal education next month . 
" So , let me send a very clear message to the prime minister : I do not just want all children back at school next month , I expect them back at school . 
No ifs , no buts , no equivocation , " he said . 
" Let me be equally clear : It is the prime minister â€™s responsibility to guarantee children get the education they need and the benefit of being back with their teachers and classmates . 
" My offer to help the government reopen schools still stands , but responsibility for making it happen lies squarely at the door of Number 10 . "
