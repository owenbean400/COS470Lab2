Mexican airline Interjet said on Sunday it will increase the number of routes and frequency of its domestic flights starting in September , including boosting travel options to the country ’s northern states and popular tourist destinations . 
Interjet , one of Mexico ’s three biggest airlines with a portfolio of more than 50 routes , said it will enforce health and safety measures and also offer its passengers free rapid Covid 19 tests and N95 masks . 
In July , Interjet received a $ 150m ( £ 112m ) capital injection to help it through a major restructuring in a bid to offset the crisis in the airline sector as the coronavirus pandemic choked global travel .
