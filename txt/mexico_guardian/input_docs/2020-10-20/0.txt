Mexico is doubling down on its public health message to avoid big crowds and avert a second wave of coronavirus infections as annual festivities approach . 
The upcoming Day of the Dead traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of people nationwide . 
The 1-2 November Day of the Dead celebration blends Catholic rituals and the pre Hispanic belief that the dead return once a year from the underworld as cemeteries , public gardens and houses light up in the bright , orange colour of planted marigold . 
Authorities have said cemeteries will remain closed and the government of Mexico City , the country ’s largest metropolis , warned that tighter coronavirus curbs may be on their way as hospitalisations rise in the sprawling capital . 
From a public health standpoint , Mexico ’s cemeteries " become areas of high risk for contagion " during the annual celebration , deputy health minister Hugo López Gatell said . 
" The recommendation is to avoid crowds . " 
Another " high risk opportunity " for infections is the Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe on 12 December , said López Gatell , as annually upwards of 3 million pilgrims flock to the Catholic basilica in Mexico City to honour the nation ’s patron saint . 
Both festivities , along with Christmas , come as the weather is turning colder and authorities fear an uptick in contagion .
