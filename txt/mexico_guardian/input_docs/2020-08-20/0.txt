There ’s another development in the story about the Russian vaccine after Mexico ’s government said it would receive at least 2,000 doses to test among its population . 
As we reported earlier , Russia is starting trials of the vaccine on around 40,000 people next week . 
" Mexico was offered at least 2,000 doses of the vaccine to do its protocol to start testing it in Mexico , which is very good news because again we buy ourselves time , " said Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard .
