Latin America has started to resume normal social and public life at a time when the Covid 19 pandemic still requires major control interventions , World Health Organization regional director Carissa Etienne said on Wednesday . 
Coronavirus cases in Colombia â€™s border area with Venezuela have increased ten fold in the last two weeks , Etienne said in a virtual briefing from Washington with other Pan American Health Organization directors . 
Death rates are climbing in parts of Mexico , and similar trends are seen in Ecuador , Costa Rica and Bolivia , with similar patterns also emerging in areas of Argentina , she warned . 
Although the entire world is racing to develop new tools to prevent and cure Covid 19 , a safe and effective vaccine that can be manufactured and delivered at scale is not around the corner . 
We must be clear that opening up too early gives this virus more room to spread and puts our populations at greater risk . 
Look no further than Europe . 
Etienne said governments must monitor travel very carefully because reopening to tourism can lead to setbacks . 
That has happened in the Caribbean , where several countries that had virtually no cases have experienced spikes as tourism resumed . 
According to a Reuters tally , Latin America has recorded around 8.4 million coronavirus cases , and over 314,000 deaths , both figures being the highest of any region .
