Mexico City ’s mayor has warned tighter coronavirus curbs could come into effect later in the week as Covid 19 hospitalisations in the capital rise . 
" We still have time to take preventative measures to keep 
[ hospitalisations [ from increasing in the coming weeks , " mayor Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters , noting that hospital beds for coronavirus patients are just under half full . 
Hospitalisations have ticked up for nearly 10 days , and officials are monitoring the trend this week to determine if it indicates an upswing of infections in Mexico ’s biggest urban hub - a metropolis of some 9 million people ringed by dense suburban sprawl . 
Sheinbaum said she did not want to ban any activity outright , but would consider limitations such as reducing operating hours of some businesses to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and to avoid more deaths . 
Mexico has lost 86,167 lives to the coronavirus pandemic and registered 851,227 infections , according to government data , although the true figures could be much higher . 
" Let ’s be aware that the pandemic is continuing ... we have to keep protecting ourselves , " Sheinbaum said .
