Colombia ’s lower house abruptly ended its session on Thursday and asked lawmakers to quarantine after a member tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Lawmakers in Colombia , which has registered more than 1.1 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 32,000 deaths , have the option to connect virtually or attend sessions in person . 
At least 150 lawmakers could potentially have been exposed , the chamber ’s press office said . 
Representatives should avoid travel to their home regions and remain in Bogota while they wait 72 hours from potential exposure to have a test , said the president of the chamber , Conservative representative German Blanco . 
Obviously this is a delicate and grave circumstance . 
I ’m going to end the session , because I have the responsibility not to maintain debate ... 
Blanco said representative Alejandro Carlos Chacon , of the Liberal party , tested positive for coronavirus after attending Wednesday ’s session . 
Chacon did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment . 
All lawmakers should remain in the capital until Saturday , said representative Maria Jose Pizarro , relaying recommendations from the city ’s health department . 
Last month a senator from Mexico ’s ruling party died after contracting Covid 19 .
