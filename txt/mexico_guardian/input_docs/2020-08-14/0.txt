The Argentine biotech firm contracted to produce 400 million doses of an Astra Zeneca Covid 19 vaccine for Latin America said on Friday it could start shipping the active substance of the product to Mexico for completion . 
Esteban Corley , director of m Abxience , the biotech firm , said he expected the vaccine could be distributed in Latin America between April and May . 
The vaccine candidate , which is likely to cost between three and four dollars per dose , has raised hopes in the badly hit region , which has seen just under a third of global deaths and cases . 
" Sometime in late February these materials will be exported to Mexico and in Mexico they will be formulated , filled and released " through Mexican Laboratory Biomont , Corley told journalists in a digital press conference . 
On Wednesday , the Argentine government said it had agreed to co produce with Mexico and Britain â€™s second largest drugmaker , Astra Zeneca Plc , the potential vaccine against the virus at present under development at the University of Oxford . 
On Thursday , the general director of Astra Zeneca in Mexico told a press conference that the trials in phase III of the product would end between the end of November or December , after which the company would seek government approvals . 
" Our understanding will be the same in all territories and is based on cost , " the director of m Abxience , part of the larger Insud Group , said . 
He added that he was confident the initial goal of producing 250 million doses in 2021 could be met .
