Local authorities across Mexico have resisted President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ’s call to lift emergency measures in municipalities without confirmed cases , warning that the pandemic is far from over . 
Mexico has registered nearly 50,000 cases and more than 5,000 deaths , and its testing rate ranks among the lowest in Latin America , with just 0.4 tests per 1,000 people . 
But , on Monday , approximately 300 municipalities throughout the country – called " municipalities of hope " – were given the green light to restart economic activities and lift sheltering in place recommendations . 
Similar measures are scheduled to start 1 June in the rest of the country , while classes will resume the same day . 
López Obrador said : We need to maintain discipline , not relax this discipline since we ’re almost there . 
I have a lot of faith and many expectations that we ’re going to finish taming this pandemic .
