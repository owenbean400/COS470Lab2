Steven Marshall is talking about the lifting of the hard lockdown in South Australia at midnight tonight . 
" The vast majority of businesses will be back trading . 
There will be some restrictions right through to the 1 December , " he says . 
" The No 1 priority is getting businesses stood up as quickly as possible . " 
He is asked if there will be compensation for businesses affected by the hard lockdown this week . 
" Compensation is not something we are contemplating at this point in time , " Marshall says . 
" What we â€™re trying to do is get through the situation , this very difficult situation , get back to the situation that we had prior to the Parafield cluster emerging . 
Which was , I think , the best level of restrictions in the entire country . " 
He says he does not want South Australian residents to think that there is no further risk in the community once that lockdown lifts tonight . 
" I do not want anyone watching this telecast to think that the risks are over , " he says . 
" While the risk is far more diminished ... the risk is still there , it is a real risk that we need to adhere very strictly to the restrictions . "
