Spurrier is saying early detection of those first cases made it possible for health authorities to trace and get a handle on the cluster quickly . 
She makes some clarifications about the case linked to the Woodville Pizza Bar , which is now subject to an investigation . 
Spurrier says : " To be clear , the decision to lock down hard , and I know it has been very difficult for people in South Australia , and perhaps difficult to understand , was not based on the interview with one man . 
" We would never make those decisions in isolation of just one piece of information , it is very complex . "
