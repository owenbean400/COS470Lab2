Reporters are asking about the timeline in South Australia from the case at the pizza bar and the decision to lock down the state . 
A reporter asks : Can you give us a precise time , please , about when you were aware or made aware of the pizza box , and then the decision to lock down , to recommend a lockdown to the commissioner ? 
Spurrier : I cannot tell you exact times , you know , I am very busy and I got lots of information coming to me . 
But [ we heard ] about the Stamford case and told the press . 
Later that evening , certainly after eight or nine o â€™clock at night , when I got home , I received this other case , which I was told was the pizza delivery person ... 
I know people have a thing about the pizza box but it was a person that had a pizza there or a pizza delivery but had only had a small time of exposure to the pizza bar . 
That meant that anyone else who had a short time of exposure in the same setting could have potentially contracted the virus .
