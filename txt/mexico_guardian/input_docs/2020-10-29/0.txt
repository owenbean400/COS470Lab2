Mexicans this year paid their respects early to departed loved ones in the capital city , where the coronavirus pandemic will cast a pall over cemeteries usually resplendent with colour and light during the 1-2 November Day of the Dead celebrations . 
The festive tradition typically draws thousands of people to burial grounds and public plazas across Mexico , many dressed as skeletons , to picnic at gravesides and decorate altars with sugar skulls and photos of dead friends and relatives . 
But in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus , city authorities have reluctantly ordered cemeteries to stay closed for Day of the Dead this year , prompting Mexicans to file out early . 
At the Xilotepec Pantheon in southeastern Mexico City , Maura Medina polished a crucifix adorning the tomb of her husband , who died last December . 
Their two daughters planted bright golden marigolds , the holiday ’s traditional flower . 
" I ’m glad I came to see him , " said the elder Medina . 
" Now I feel very much at peace . " 
Only three people per family may enter the cemetery , where signs warn : " Caution , you are entering a high contagion zone . " 
Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum , who tested positive for Covid 19 this week , urged the public to mark Day of the Dead at home , and stay away from the capital ’s 120 cemeteries . 
Mexico has the world ’s fourth highest official death toll from Covid 19 , with over 90,000 fatalities . 
Adrian Velasco , who went to the final resting place of his grandparents , was grateful he could visit ahead of time . 
" It ’s good they ’ve let us come to leave our flowers and plants , " he said . 
" And above all , to be with our dead for a day . "
