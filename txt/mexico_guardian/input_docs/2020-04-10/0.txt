The G20 meeting of the world ’s most developed nations , being held by teleconference by hosts Saudi Arabia , has been struggling to broker an agreement about oil production . 
But leaders have issued a rather vague statement saying that they will try to ensure that the energy sector makes a full contribution to helping the world economy recover from the coronavirus shock . 
It said they would work on policy responses and ensure market stability , and also annouced a " short term " policy group to monitor oil market response measures .

Two of the biggest oil producers – Saudi and Russia – ramped up output last month in a shock move that sent oil prices crashing . 
There has since been hope of production cuts to stabilise prices but a clash between Saudi Arabia and Mexico has scotched those hopes , for now . 
Prices fell in trading on Friday and brent , the international crude benchmark , stands at $ 31 .
