Mexico ’s president , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , has suggested politicians who impose lockdowns or curfews to limit Covid 19 are acting like dictators . 
The comments came as López Obrador once again fended off questions about why he almost never wears a face mask , saying it was a question of liberty . 
The Mexican leader said pandemic measures that limit people ’s movements are " fashionable among authorities … who want to show they are heavy handed , dictatorship . 
" A lot of them are letting their authoritarian instincts show , " he said , adding " the fundamental thing is to guarantee liberty " . 
It was unclear if the Mexican leader was referring to authorities in other countries , or the mainly opposition party local leaders who have tried to impose limits in Mexico . 
Many governments across the world have effectively implemented lockdowns or limits on when people can leave their homes , something López Obrador has fiercely resisted doing , arguing some people live day to day on what they earn on the streets . 
Some local governments in Mexico have tried to use police to enforce limits on masks or movement , which resulted in scandals of abusive behaviour by police . 
López Obrador argues such measures should be voluntary . 
" Everyone is free . 
Whoever wants to wear a face mask and feel safer is welcome to do so , " he said . 
The Mexican government has offered changing and contradictory advice on the utility of wearing face masks . 
Mexico has seen almost 107,000 test confirmed deaths so far , the fourth highest toll in the world , but Mexico does relatively little testing and officials estimate the real death toll is closer to 150,000 .
