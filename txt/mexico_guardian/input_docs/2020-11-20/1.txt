The British prime minister , Boris Johnson , will urge other G20 leaders to take more ambitious action to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and to address climate change at a weekend virtual summit in Saudi Arabia , Reuters reports . 
In remarks ahead of the meeting , Johnson appealed to leaders of the other nations that make up the G20 group of major economies to honour their promise to do " whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic and protect lives and livelihoods " . 
He will also use Sunday ’s session to call on those leaders yet to make net zero commitments to make the same pledge , just under a month before Britain co hosts the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December . 
" The G20 committed in March to do ‘ whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic and protect lives and livelihoods ’ . 
As we meet this weekend , we must hold ourselves to account for that promise , " he said before addressing the summit . 
" If we harness the collective ingenuity and resources of the G20 , we can chart a path out of the pandemic and build a better , greener future . "
