In the US , Wisconsin ’s governor issued an emergency health order on Friday requiring face masks to be used indoors except at home , a move aimed at slowing a surge in coronavirus infections that is pushing hospitals to the limits of their capacity . 
The face covering mandate marked the latest in a flurry of new restrictions by state and local officials nationwide to tamp down Covid 19 cases soaring with the onset of winter . 
Public health experts say greater social mixing and indoor gatherings as the weather turns colder ahead of the holiday season is fuelling the escalating contagion , threatening to inundate already strained healthcare systems . 
" Wisconsin hospitals are overwhelmed and facing staffing shortages , " said the Wisconsin governor , Tony Evers , a Democrat , according to Reuters . 
His state is one of several in the upper midwest registering some of the highest rates of positive results from Covid 19 tests . 
The order , which remains in effect for 60 days , requires everyone to wear masks indoors whenever non household members are present . 
Children younger than five years of age are exempt , as are individuals who have breathing difficulties . 
The governor announced the declaration of an emergency hours after one of the nation ’s leading public health officials , Dr Deborah Birx , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , appealed to Americans to avoid unnecessary travel and limit social gatherings during next week ’s Thanksgiving holiday .
