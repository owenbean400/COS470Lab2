Top Mexican banking and financial workers are under quarantine and working from home after attending an event in the Pacific last week where at least one participant later tested positive for coronavirus . 
In contrast to much of Latin America , Mexico ’s government has taken a laissez fire approach to tackling the virus and has allowed large events to go ahead , including a banking conference in the beach resort of Acapulco and a music festival in Mexico City . 
" Citibanamex attendees at the banking convention are in quarantine and working from home , " a spokesman for Citigroup Inc ’s Mexican operations , Citibanamex , said . 
" None of them have presented any symptoms related to coronavirus . " 
The country registered its first death from coronavirus , a 41 year old diabetic Mexican man whose symptoms began last week , the health ministry said on Wednesday .
