The head of Mexico ’s efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic has sidestepped calls to resign after Mexico ’s death count rose to overtake the UK ’s as the third highest in the world . 
Assistant health secretary Hugo López Gatell expressed his respect to the nine of Mexico ’s 32 state governors who called for his resignation , adding : " I hope we can continue to work together , " the Associated Press reports . 
Mexico reported 688 further confirmed Covid 19 deaths on Friday , raising its accumulated total to 46,688 . 
The number of confirmed cases rose by a near record 8,458 , bringing Mexico ’s total cases so far to almost 425,000 . 
A letter calling for López Gatell ’s immediate resignation bore the names of 10 state governors , all from opposition parties , was made public on Friday , but later one of those governors said he had not approved the letter and distanced himself from it . 
The letter blamed the administration of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador for an erratic handling of the epidemic and a lack of efficient response that boosted Mexico ’s death toll to the third highest in the world while the country simultaneously suffered an 18.9 % drop in economic activity in the second quarter compared to the same period last year . 
Mexico has imposed a very lax and partial lockdown of economic activity that has not stopped high levels of contagion , but has strangled the economy . 
Rather than testing or contact tracing , the government has focused on expanding hospital facilities . 
The federal government has given confusing and mixed messages about whether to wear face masks . 
López Obrador himself almost never wears one , and said on Friday : " I will use a face mask when there is no more corruption , " a reference to his administration ’s anti graft crusade , which he views as the country ’s main priority .
