The Trump administration is poised to extend non essential travel restrictions at the land borders with Canada and Mexico , the acting US Department of Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf has indicated . 
We really have to see what is the health care situation like in Mexico and Canada , how are their cases , have they hit their curve ? 
What we do not want to do is try to open up parts of our economy and have a lot of folks coming across the border that we have not seen in the past 50 or 60 days . 
Canada â€™s prime minister Justin Trudeau had already said his country and the US have agreed to extend the ban at their shared border by another 30 days , after reports earlier in the day suggested such a move was likely .
