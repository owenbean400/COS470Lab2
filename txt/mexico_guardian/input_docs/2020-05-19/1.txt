Beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico , the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in an alarming sign that the pandemic may be only at the start of its destructive march through the region . 
More than 90 % of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile ’s capital , Santiago , whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths , AP reports . 
In Lima , Peru , patients took up 80 % of intensive care beds as of Friday . 
Peru has the world ’s 12th highest number of confirmed cases , with more than 90,000 . 
" Were in bad shape , " said Pilar Mazzetti , head of the Peruvian governments Covid 19 task force . 
" This is war . " 
In some cities , doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they could not get to a hospital fast enough . 
With intensive care units swamped , officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that are not as busy running the risk of spreading the disease further . 
Latin American countries halted international flights and rolled out social distancing guidelines around the same time as the US and Europe , delaying the arrival of large scale infection , said Dr . Marcos Espinal , director of communicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization . 
Latin America is the worlds most unequal region , a reality that Espinal said made it difficult to balance health and economic growth , with millions facing increased poverty during quarantines , curfews and shutdowns .
