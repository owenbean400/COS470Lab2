Italy on Saturday became the European country with the highest official number of Covid fatalities , as its new total of 64,036 deaths overtook Britain , according to an Agence France Presse tally . 
The Italian health ministry said that 649 people had died from the virus in the previous 24 hours and that 19,903 new cases had been diagnosed . 
Worldwide , the US has reported the highest number of Covid 19 deaths , with 295,539 as of Saturday morning , followed by Brazil , India and Mexico . 
According to the AFP tally for Europe , Italy overtook Britain , which has reported 64,026 deaths and is followed by France with 57,567 and Spain with 47,624 . 
Italy was the first European country to suffer a wave of infections earlier this year . 
The UK ’s toll overtook that of Italy on 6 May , with close to 30,000 fatalities , and for a while over the summer the southern European nation appeared to have weathered the storm . 
But despite the introduction of mass testing , cases began rising again in early autumn , as they did in many other nations - and deaths inevitably followed . 
Italy ’s national medical association said Friday that a total of 251 doctors have now died from the virus . 
" In this second wave , it is mainly general practitioners who are paying the highest toll , " warned Filippo Anelli , head of the FNOMCe O association . 
He blamed " greater circulation " of asymptomatic patients , but added that all doctors did not have the necessary protective equipment . 
" We must put an end to this massacre , " he said .
