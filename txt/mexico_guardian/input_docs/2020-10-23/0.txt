The mayor of Mexico City , the country ’s largest city , called on residents to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people as the capital grapples with a surge of coronavirus hospital admissions . 
Health authorities have been warning that large gatherings , such as the 1-2 November Day of the Dead festivities that usually draw hundreds of thousands of people nationwide , could prompt another wave of infections . 
The pandemic has led to more than 874,000 infections and killed nearly 87,900 people in Mexico . 
Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said that from 10 to 19 October , total coronavirus hospitalisations in the capital rose to 2,775 from 2,565 , still far below the peak of 4,575 patients in hospital in late May . She added that six out of 10 beds hospital beds are still available for Covid 19 patients . 
Mexico City will remain at the second most restrictive level on a four level scale of health measures but cemeteries that typically host Day of the Dead celebrations will be closed for the holiday , Sheinbaum said . 
" We ’re not at the level to return to ‘ red , ’ " Sheinbaum told reporters , referring to the strictest level of containment measures . 
" But we ’re also not in a situation to open new activities . " 
She recommended that gatherings be limited to no more than 10 people after large weddings , baptisms and other celebrations in which proper health measures were not observed led to the spread of the virus .
