Mexico said it plans to take part in stage 3 trials of the Russian coronavirus vaccine in October , part of the nation ’s efforts to secure supplies of possible future Covid 19 vaccines . 
Foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said that if the Mexican regulator permits it , the Russian vaccine can be brought to Mexico and several thousand volunteers will " test that vaccine in our country as close as next month " . 
Ebrard has previously said that 2,000 Mexican volunteers would take part in clinical trials of Russia ’s " Sputnik V " vaccine . 
The race to produce a vaccine has become a contest for influence and prestige among major powers , while developing economies are trying to ensure a fair distribution of the medicines . 
Mexico has engaged in a diplomatic push to forge Covid 19 vaccine alliances across a wide ideological spectrum of countries from France to Cuba as a World Health Organization vaccine initiative is expected to fall short of its needs .
