Mexico will resume sending temporary farmworkers to Canada after the two countries reached an agreement on improved safety protections for labourers on Canadian farms during the coronavirus pandemic , the Mexican government has said . 
Mexico said last Tuesday it would pause sending workers to farms with coronavirus infections after at least two of its nationals died from Covid 19 after outbreaks on 17 Canadian farms , according to Reuters . 
Canadian farmers rely on 60,000 short term foreign workers , predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean , to plant and harvest crops . 
Mexico â€™s foreign ministry said in a statement that the Temporary Agricultural Workers Program had " entered into operation once again after a temporary pause . " 
The two nations " reached an agreement to improve the sanitary conditions of the nationals who work on farms , " the statement added .
