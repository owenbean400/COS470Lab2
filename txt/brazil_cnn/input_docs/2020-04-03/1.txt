The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday changed its position on a sought after type of respirator from China , the KN95 , announcing that the agency will authorize the mask for use in healthcare settings if it meets certain criteria . 
In response to continued respirator shortages , the FDA issued new guidance , authorizing KN95 respirators if certain criteria are met , including evidence demonstrating that the respirator is authentic . 
The move comes after conflicting government guidance caused confusion over how these masks should be used and whether they could be imported into the US . 
The FDA did not include these masks on its initial guidance for emergency use issued last month , but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the KN95 masks are " expected to be suitable alternatives " to the N95 masks during the coronavirus pandemic when supplies are short . 
The differing guidance left suppliers hesitant to ship masks and US buyers wary of purchasing them . 
On March 28th , the FDA listed masks from six countries , including Mexico and Brazil , that it found " appropriate to protect public health or safety , " but left the Chinese masks off the list .
