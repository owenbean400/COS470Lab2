A shipment of US made ventilators arrived Thursday in Russia , the US Embassy in Moscow said . 
An earlier shipment of 50 US made ventilators arrived in Moscow on May 21 . 
Russia is currently the third hardest hit country worldwide by the virus following the US and Brazil . 
While the country 's official death toll is relatively low , with more than 5,000 deaths , some critics and experts say the figure is almost certainly underestimated . 
Moscow 's mortality rate surged by 18 % in April compared to the same month last year , as well as compared to the April average for the past decade , according to data released by the city 's civil register office . 
The situation has led to growing anger in the country , with concerns raised about the conditions in which medical workers are forced to operate . 
As of early Thursday , Russia has reported at least 440,538 cases of Covid 19 and at least 5,376 virus related deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University data .
