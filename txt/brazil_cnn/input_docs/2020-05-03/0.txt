Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the impact of the virus , likening it to " a little flu . " 
Bolsonaro is also under pressure to show his Covid 19 test results . 
A federal judge from Sao Paulo had initially set a deadline of Saturday for the President to submit his results . 
However the 3rd Federal Regional Tribunal suspended the order that mandated the tests to be presented . 
An appeal was made on behalf of the Attorney General 's office to extend the deadline for five more days for the case to be reviewed .
