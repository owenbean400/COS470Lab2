Peru was one of the first nations in the region to take strict preventative measures , such as stay at home orders , curfews and border closings . 
But it also shares some of the weaknesses of its neighbors . 
Lockdown measures failed to hold . 
Many of Peru 's poor have no choice but to venture outside their homes for work , food or financial transactions , leading to crowding in markets , on public transport and outside banks . 
Peru has historically spent less than the 6 % of GDP on public health recommended by PAHO , according to an official at the Pan American Health Organization , despite efforts to dedicate more resources to the sector in recent years . 
The country spent 3.165 % of GDP on public health in 2017 , according to the World Bank . 
Peru also has under two hospital beds per 1,000 people , and oxygen is in short supply .
