In the Brazilian city of Manaus , the capital of the northwestern state of Amazonas , excavators are digging mass graves , which are later filled with several coffins by cemetery workers , according to CNN affiliate CNN Brasil . 
The city is handling more than 100 burials a day due to coronavirus , according to the office of Manaus Mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto . 
Before the spread of the disease , the average was 30 burials a day . 
The department responsible for burials in the city started to dig trenches to carry out the burials of Covid 19 victims . 
This practice is used by other countries and preserves the identities of the bodies , with distance between the coffins and the respective identifications . 
In an interview with CNN Brasil Tuesday evening , Virgilio Neto said the health system is no longer able to serve those who need treatment and people have started to die at home .
