Brazil ’s health ministry reported on Saturday that the first laboratory confirmed death by Covid 19 in the country occurred on March 12 -- four days earlier than previously reported . 
The patient who died on March 12 was a 57 year old woman admitted to a public hospital in São Paulo the day before , according to the ministry . 
On Saturday , the health ministry also reported another virus death took place on March 15 . 
In a press release , the health ministry referred to seven deaths that occurred between March 16 and 17 in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , though it was not clear if these , too , were newly confirmed Covid 19 deaths to be added to Brazil ’s official count . 
The health ministry said new details had come to light after it had bought more diagnostic tests and given them to states . 
CNN asked the health ministry via email for more information on how the March 12 death became registered as a Covid 19 fatality more than three months after it happened . 
The ministry did not immediately respond to the query .
