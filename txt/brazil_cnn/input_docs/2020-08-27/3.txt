Indigenous Brazilian protesters removed their barricades from a key highway in Brazil ’s Amazon on Wednesday , after 10 days of protest against the federal government . 
The group has decided to end their protest until a decision is reached regarding a lawsuit filed by Pará state 's Federal Public Attorney . 
The suit urges the government to renew a program that compensates communities for the environmental impact the highway has over their territory . 
The indigenous group also has another demand : for the government to step up its efforts to contain Covid 19 , which has ravaged their community . 
The Kayapó Mekragnoti people first blocked the highway last Monday , August 17 , near the city of Novo Progresso to demand health assistance , medical supplies and food to fight the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The indigenous group kept the road open since Saturday as it negotiated with government officials . 
By Wednesday , August 26 , the group decided to leave the highway for good and return home .
