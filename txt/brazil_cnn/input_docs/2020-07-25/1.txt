The head of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases says President Jair Bolsonaro set a " bad example " by socializing and not wearing a mask right after his negative Covid 19 test announcement . 
Saturday ’s announcement by Bolsonaro that he ’d tested negative comes after numerous positive tests since announcing on July 7 that he was infected with Covid 19 . 
On Saturday morning Bolsonaro greeted supporters , at times without a mask , and rode his motorcycle after he announced his negative test result . 
Dr . Estevão Urbano , president of the infectious diseases society , told CNN that he believes Boslonaro ’s behavior sets a " bad example " as more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus are being reported daily in Brazil .
