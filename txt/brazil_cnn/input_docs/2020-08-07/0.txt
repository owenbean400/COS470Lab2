Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said in a Facebook Live appearance that his country is " going to get on with life , " as it inches closer to recording 100,000 deaths connected to the pandemic . 
Brazil 's Covid 19 death toll reached nearly 98,500 on Thursday . 
More than 2.9 million cases have been identified in the country since the pandemic began . 
Bolsonaro later attributed the high number of fatalities to what he described as an error in diagnosing the cause of deaths in Brazil . 
More hydroxychloroquine : Bolsonaro also said he might ask US President Donald Trump for more of the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine to help him combat Covid 19 . 
Hydroxychloroquine is an anti malarial drug that some have touted as a treatment for Covid 19 , but more evidence has been emerging recently that it does not help coronavirus patients . 
Several studies have found no benefits to treating Covid 19 patients with the antimalarial drug and Dr . Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , said last month there was " no evidence " that the drug helps treat Covid 19 . 
Bolsonaro mentioned that Trump donated the drug to the Brazilian government in May and said he can ask for more . 
" I accepted the donation of the pills , which have not yet been distributed . 
I have no problem calling the American president . 
If ( he ) has more , send it to us . 
We will send a plane to get it , or he will send a plane here . 
And we can distribute this material , " he said .
