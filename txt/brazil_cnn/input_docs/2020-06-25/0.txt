Brazil announced plans to expand coronavirus testing in a televised briefing from the health ministry Wednesday . 
The ministry estimates the delivery of 46.5 million tests to the public health system by the end of the year , Secretary of Health Surveillance Arnaldo Correia said in the briefing . 
Of those tests , there will be 24.5 million PCR tests that look for direct evidence of the virus and 22 million serological tests , which measure antibodies to indicate a previous infection . 
Brazil previously only allowed testing for those hospitalized , but the new recommendations will also allow for tests on people reporting mild Covid 19 symptoms , Correia added . 
Correia also said the ministry was expecting the curve from newly reported cases to flatten last week , but the numbers showed an increase from the previous week . 
In the past three days alone , the country reported 103,593 new cases . 
Total confirmed cases stand at 1,188,631 , according to the health ministry Wednesday .
