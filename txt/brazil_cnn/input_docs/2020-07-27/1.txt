A coalition representing health professionals in Brazil denounced President Jair Bolsonaro for " crimes against humanity " in a judicial complaint to the Hague International Court of Justice . 
The document , sent to the attorney general of the International Criminal Court , argues that Bolsonaro committed crimes against humanity by refusing to take necessary measures to protect the public during the pandemic . 
The complaint is signed by the Brazilian Union Network UNISa√∫de , a group of more than a million health workers in the country , supported by unions and international entities . 
The public at risk : The coalition accused Bolsonaro of being careless by promoting gatherings of supporters , approaching them without a mask , and advertising medication like hydroxychloroquine that have no scientific proof of effectiveness against Covid 19 . 
Marcio Monzane , regional secretary of UNI Americas , a branch of the international union federation UNI Global Union , said in a statement Sunday that the Bolsonaro government should be blamed for " its callous action in the face of the pandemic and for refusing to protect Brazil 's health workers as well as the population , which he promised to defend when he became president . " 
The official response : The President 's office said the matter is with the Republic Attorney General 's Office ( AGU ) when CNN requested a comment . 
The AGU said it will only comment when it receives the subpoena from court .
