Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil on Wednesday that he had tested positive again for Covid 19 , just over two weeks after his initial test came back positive . 
Bolsonaro , who spoke to a CNN Brasil reporter on the phone , has been working in semi isolation from the presidential residence since July 7 , when he first announced he had tested positive . 
He initially said he had a low grade fever , but he did not come down with any serious symptoms . 
A long time proponent of the controversial malaria drug hydroxychloroquine , Bolsonaro announced he was taking it and has repeatedly said he believes the drug has helped him . 
The Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases , in a report published last week , urged medical professionals to stop using hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus , because it has been proved ineffective and can cause collateral damage . 
Bolsonaro , who spent months downplaying the virus , often strolls out on the grounds of the presidential palace to greet supporters , and has continued to do so since his positive diagnosis earlier this month . 
On Tuesday , he told the crowd gathered there that he hoped his latest test , the third since becoming infected , would come back negative so he could get back to work .
