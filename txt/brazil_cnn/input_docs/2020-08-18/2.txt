A Brazilian federal judge has ordered members of the Kayap처 Mekr찾gnotire indigenous community to clear roadblocks off a major interstate highway , which they had set to demand greater government assistance in the ongoing coronavirus crisis . 
On Monday , dozens of indigenous protesters carrying sticks , arrows and machetes , built two barricades on the highway near Novo Progresso , in the northern state of Para . 
They demanded health assistance , food and medical supplies . 
They also protested deforestation and illegal activities in their territories , according to a statement from the Kabu Institute , an NGO created to manage indigenous villages and inspect the region 's forests . 
Federal police have been tasked to enforce the clearing of the highway while respecting the rights of the indigenous people , according to the judge 's order . 
If the protesters fail to remove the barricades , they face a daily fine of 10,000 reais ( $ 1,800 ) . 
Why they chose the highway : Indigenous leaders argue that proximity to the road brought coronavirus to their villages , the Kabu Institute told CNN Monday . 
The first coronavirus cases among the Kayap처 Mekr찾gnotire occurred as a result of their contact with urban populations and the presence of illegal miners in their reserves . 
So far , 21,000 indigenous people in Brazil have been infected with Covid 19 and 618 have died , according to the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( APIB ) .
