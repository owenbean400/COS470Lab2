Two thousand Brazilians will participate in June tests of a vaccine against Covid 19 developed by Oxford University in partnership with Astra Zeneca pharmaceutical , the Federal University of Sao Paulo ( Unifesp ) said in a statement . 
On Tuesday , the Brazilian Ministry of Health approved the beginning of the study that will vaccinate 1,000 patients in SÃ£o Paulo and 1,000 more in Rio de Janeiro . 
The country is the first site of these vaccination tests outside the United Kingdom . 
The study will happen as Brazil is registering an increase in the number of cases and deaths . 
Tuesday 's reported death toll of 1,262 was a record for a 24 hour period . 
Brazil 's biggest cities have started to relax the social isolation rules imposed since mid March . 
Other countries will also participate in the study and the official registration of the vaccine is expected to be made later this year in the United Kingdom , Unifesp said in its statement . 
Brazil is now the country with the second highest number of cases after the United States , and the rate of infections continues to rise .
