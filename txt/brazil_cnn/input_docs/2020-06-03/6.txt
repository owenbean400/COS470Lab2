Brazil has been 19 days without a health minister so far . 
Bolsonaro suggested that for the time being , he does not plan on naming a permanent replacement for Nelson Teich , his second health minister to resign .

Some background : Brazil has had two health ministers since the beginning of the pandemic . 
The original cabinet minister , Nelson Mandetta , was dismissed on April 16 by Bolsonaro for disagreeing with the president 's handling of the pandemic . 
Mandetta â€™s replacement , Teich , also resigned after less than a month in office for the same reason . 
Bolsonaro has been nominating military personnel to key positions in the health ministry for the past month .
