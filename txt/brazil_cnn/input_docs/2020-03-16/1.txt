Ultimate Fighting Championship is postponing its next three events , UFC president Dana White announced during an interview with ESPN . 
The last of the postponed events was scheduled to have taken place on April 11 . 
White said the UFC still plans to host its April 18 pay per view event , which is currently scheduled to take place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , New York . 
White said they hope to keep the event at Barclays but will look at relocating it , including moving it outside of the US if necessary . 
The UFC raised eyebrows last weekend by being one of the only major American sporting outfits to stage an event when they held their scheduled fights in an empty arena in Brasilia , Brazil .
