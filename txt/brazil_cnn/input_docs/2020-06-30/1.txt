Brazil 's health ministry reported 1,280 new Covid 19 deaths in the past 24 hours , nearly doubling the previous day 's count . 
The country 's death toll stands at 59,594 as Rio de Janeiro state alone surpassed 10,000 total deaths from the virus Tuesday , according to Rio 's state health secretary . 
The national health ministry also recorded another 33,846 new cases Tuesday , bringing the country 's total to at least 1,402,041 . 
This comes after a new survey published Tuesday showed that fewer Brazilians are sheltering at home , although showing they are increasingly afraid of contracting the virus . 
At the end of June , 47 % of Brazilians were " very afraid " of contracting the novel coronavirus , up from 36 % in mid March when several states ordered all but essential businesses to close , according to the Datafolha polling firm . 
Nonetheless , fewer Brazilians reported staying at home . 
Those who reported remaining totally isolated fell to 12 % from 18 % and those who said they were taking precautions but still leaving home to work and perform other activities was up to 34 % from 24 % .
