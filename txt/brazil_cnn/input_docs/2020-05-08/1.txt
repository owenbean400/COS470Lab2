Brazil 's coronavirus cases have spiked to 135,106 including 9,146 deaths , according to numbers released Wednesday by the Brazilian Health Ministry . 
This surge comes as President Jair Bolsonaro 's spokesman , Gen . Otavio Santana do Rego Barros , confirmed he tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Yet Bolsonaro said earlier this week he believed " the worst had passed " for the coronavirus pandemic , during a press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia . 
But as the number of cases and deaths continue to climb , many health experts fear the worst is yet to come .
