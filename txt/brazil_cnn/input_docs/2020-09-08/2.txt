About 15,500 passengers traveled on the Delhi metro in India on Monday , the first day that subway trains came back into service after a five month closure due to the pandemic . 
That 's a little over one hundredth of the 1.5 million people who traveled on these trains daily prior to lockdown measures , according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ( DMRC ) . 
Trains had reduced operating times -- running for four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening -- and reducing the carrying capacity to just 20 % compared to usual . 
The metro resumed services of one of its busiest lines on Monday and its nine other routes will resume operations in a graded manner by September 12 .
