France 's overall coronavirus death toll surpassed 40,000 on Saturday . 
The country 's total death toll now stands at 40,169 after 306 new deaths were registered in a 24 hour period , according to the French Public Health Agency . 
France has the world 's seventh highest coronavirus fatality count , according to official data from Johns Hopkins University , but that is still only a fraction of the death toll seen in the worst hit countries : the United States and Brazil . 
This grim milestone comes after France had two consecutive days of record new daily coronavirus cases , with more than 60,000 new coronavirus cases announced on Friday alone . 
The French Public Health Agency has not yet specified the daily case count for Saturday to reflect the previous 24 hours . 
As Europe experiences its second wave of coronavirus cases with winter approaching , French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that his country needs to live with the virus in the longterm . 
" When I listen to the scientists , and the Scientific Council , we foresee [ living with the virus ] at best until next summer , " Macron said , speaking during a visit to a health center .
