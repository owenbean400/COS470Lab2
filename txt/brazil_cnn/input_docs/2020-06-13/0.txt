Upset by the death of a hospitalized relative , members of a Brazilian family stormed the intensive care unit of a Rio de Janeiro hospital used to treat Covid 19 patients on Friday . 
According to Rio de Janeiro ’s municipal health secretary , the visibly upset family entered the ICU , broke a sign and slammed a door . 
Security staff and members of the health staff intervened to calm the situation at the Ronaldo Gazolla Hospital . 
Rio ’s municipal health secretary denied a local media report that the relatives wanted to inspect ICU bed occupancy following a call by President Jair Bolsonaro to do so . 
Dr . Alexandre Telles , president of a local doctors ’ union and a physician at the Ronaldo Gazolla Hospital , told CNN the family members entered a restricted area . 
The incident followed a call from Bolsonaro asking Brazilians to enter Covid 19 wards to inspect hospital conditions . 
Bolsonaro said in a Facebook Live on Thursday that local politicians may be inflating data on the number of deaths from coronavirus to receive more money and to blame his government for the country 's infections spike . 
Brazil has more than 828,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 41,000 deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally .
