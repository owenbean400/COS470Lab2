Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro defended the measures he 's been taking to fight the coronavirus in his country and claimed the mainstream media and some governors are trying to " trick " the population into believing the pandemic is worse . 
During a Sunday interview with CNN affiliate Record TV , Bolsonaro said " the people will soon know they have been tricked by those governors and the mainstream media " and said extreme measures , like lockdowns , could lead to a rise in unemployment . 
The comments came after Bolsonaro faced several nights of protests in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo , where people banged pots and pans from their windows . 
Sao Paulo , Brazil 's most populous state and the most affected by the coronavirus , went into lockdown Tuesday , forcing nonessential businesses to shut down for 15 days and limiting restaurants to delivery service .
