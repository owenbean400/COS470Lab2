Dr . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said on Monday that Astra Zeneca 's vaccine candidate showing 70 % efficacy on average is " good news , " but he is waiting to be briefed on the data . 
Astra Zeneca 's announcement noted that the 70 % efficacy of its vaccine is actually the average of two very different vaccination schedules tested in its trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil . 
One schedule included 2,741 study participants who were given a half dose , followed by a full dose at least one month apart – that showed an efficacy of 90 % . 
The other schedule included 8,895 study participants who were given two full doses at least one month apart – that showed 62 % efficacy . 
" To have a 90 % efficacy in one of the components – mainly one dose range of the components , which was a half a dose first followed by a full dose – that 's good news , " Fauci said . 
" What that tells us now is that this is the third vaccine that we have giving a very high degree of efficacy , which bodes well for vaccinology in general , in the context of Covid 19 , " Fauci said . 
" We would like to have multiple candidates that are highly efficacious . "
