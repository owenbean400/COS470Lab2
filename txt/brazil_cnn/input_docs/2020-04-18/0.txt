A group of Brazilian diplomats and civilians has been flown home from the Venezuela capital of Caracas on an air force flight , according to a statement released Friday by the country 's Foreign and Defense ministries . 
In March , the Brazilian government recalled four diplomats and 11 other officials from its mission in Venezuela , including Brazil ’s Consul General in Caracas , Elza de Castro , after months of degrading diplomatic ties between the countries . 
In the same month , Brazil " partially " closed its border with Venezuela . 
CNN contacted Brazil ’s government for further comment on reasons behind the flight but has not yet received a response .
