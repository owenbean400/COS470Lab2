The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) has started a rolling review of the Astra Zeneca Oxford vaccine candidate , it said in a statement on Thursday . 
According to the EMA , " a rolling review is one of the regulatory tools that the Agency uses to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency , " and it basically means that instead of evaluating all the data on the vaccine after it is completed , the agency will evaluate the data as it becomes available , in order to speed up its potential approval , if all the safety and effectiveness criteria are met . 
" EMA will complete its assessment according to its usual standards for quality , safety and effectiveness , " the EMA also said in its statement . 
The EMA had used the rolling review process in the assessment of the Covid 19 medicine remdesivir , but it â€™s the first time it is applying it to a vaccine . 
Trials for the Astra Zeneca Oxford vaccine have been resumed in Britain , Brazil and South Africa after a participant developed a serious illness , but remain on hold in the United States , the US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr . Stephen Hahn confirmed on Wednesday , without revealing why . 
" I ca not speak to confidential commercial information and this summit knows that all too well , " he said .
