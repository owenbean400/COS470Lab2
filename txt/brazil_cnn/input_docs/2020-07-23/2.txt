The three countries worst hit by coronavirus right now are strong and able , but the World Health Organization can help if needed , officials said Wednesday . 
" We are always ready and will always remain ready to provide advice , input and service to any of our member states wherever they are , " WHO ’s Dr . Mike Ryan said during a briefing Thursday in Geneva . 
Ryan said that the WHO regional office for Southeast Asia was in Delhi and one of their largest country offices in the Americas is in Brazil . 
" Those countries are intertwined with us , " Ryan said . 
The US , Brazil and India lead the world in new coronavirus cases at present . 
Ryan said he believes all three of these countries are " powerful , able , democratic countries , who have tremendous internal capacities to deal with this disease , " and they can " turn this around , because of the nature of their public health , their science and their innate capacities to fight this disease . " 
Dr . Maria Van Kerkhove , WHO ’s technical lead for coronavirus response , agreed with Ryan . 
" We are here to help all countries , and we work through our regional offices and we work through our country offices to provide support to everyone , everywhere , " she said . 
" And I think just a message to say that even in those three countries that have the highest number of cases right now , can be turned around . 
It can be turned around , and there are tools that all countries have that can do that . " 
These tools involve physical distancing , hand hygiene and being informed about where the virus is present , Kerkhove said .
