Brazil 's most famous coronavirus patient , President Jair Bolsonaro , said during his daily walk Thursday that he will be taking another coronavirus test " in the next few days " and asked for patience while the country is trying to address several challenges . 
" Brazil has been doing a lot of wrong things that have been going on for a long time , we ca not fix it overnight . 
I ask for your patience , right ? 
Any business there , people usually criticize and shoot down , " Bolsonaro said . 
Bolsonaro told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil on Wednesday that he had tested positive again for Covid 19 , just over two weeks after his initial test came back positive . 
He has been working in semi isolation from the presidential residence since July 7 , when he first announced he had tested positive . 
Bolsonaro touted hydroxychloroquine again , despite a warning from the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases urging medical professionals to stop using the drug to treat coronavirus because it has been proved ineffective and can cause damage .
