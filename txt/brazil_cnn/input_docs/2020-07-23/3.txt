More evidence is emerging to underscore that the anti malarial drug hydroxychloroquine does not help Covid 19 patients . 
A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday found that the use of hydroxychloroquine – given either alone or in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin – did not improve the conditions of hospitalized patients with mild to moderate Covid 19 . 
The study , led by researchers in Brazil , included 504 patients with confirmed Covid 19 who either needed no supplemental oxygen , or were receiving up to 4 liters per minute of oxygen . 
The study was conducted across 55 hospitals in Brazil . 
The patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard of care ; hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400mg twice daily ; or hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400mg twice daily , plus azithromycin at a dose of 500mg once daily for seven days , according to the study . 
The researchers then assessed how the patients were doing 15 days later . 
The study noted that receiving either hydroxychloroquine alone or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin did not appear to affect the condition of the patients at the 15 day mark . 
Additionally , unusual heart rhythms and elevated liver enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin , according to the study . 
The study was funded by the Coalition Covid 19 Brazil and EMS Pharma , a pharmaceutical company in Brazil .
