Brazil 's interim health minister said Wednesday the coronavirus situation seems " under control , " despite the country reporting a record number of new cases Wednesday . 
In a press conference before the country 's official daily Covid 19 numbers were released , interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said , " The scenario seems to me to be under control , " but recognized there are still " increasing cases " and claimed the increase was because of the weather . 
There has previously been speculation that warmer weather would lessen the spread , specifically from US President Donald Trump early in the pandemic . 
However , health experts have said warmer weather is unlikely to stop the spread of Covid 19 . 
Pazuello also said he was hopeful about the health system 's capacity now that they have learned more from the outbreak . 
The Health Ministry released Brazil 's daily coronavirus numbers shortly after the press conference , reporting 67,860 newly confirmed cases , the country 's highest daily toll since the outbreak began . 
The ministry also added 1,284 new deaths . 
Brazil 's total number of Covid 19 cases is 2,227,514 and 82,771 total deaths .
