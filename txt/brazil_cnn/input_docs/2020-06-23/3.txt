Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed raising taxes for the country 's upper middle class earners to help cover added budgetary costs brought on by the coronavirus pandemic , eliminating the flat personal income tax rate for upper middle class . 
In a televised address Tuesday , Putin said the proposed tax increase from 13 % to 15 % would apply those who earn more than 5 million rubles ( $ 72,900 ) a year . 
The additional budgetary funds would be used for medical treatment of children , he said . 
Russia has the third highest confirmed cases of the virus in the world , right after the United States and Brazil , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . 
Putin said the economic fallout was a " serious challenge " for Russia . 
The country has come under criticism at home and abroad for its response , but Putin claimed early measures by the government helped save " tens of thousands of lives " of Russian citizens .
