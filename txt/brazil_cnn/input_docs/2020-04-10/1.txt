A 15 year old teen from the Yanomami indigenous tribe died Thursday from coronavirus related causes in northern Brazil , according to a statement from the country ’s health ministry . 
The teen had been hospitalized since last Friday in the state of Roraima ’s General Hospital in capital Boa Vista , according to the statement . 
The Association of the Indigenous People of Brazil ( APIB ) , a watchdog group that defends indigenous rights , told CNN at least two other indigenous people have died from coronavirus complications . 
However , this is the first indigenous death confirmed by the Brazilian Health Ministry . 
The teen was from the Rehebe village , an area that indigenous activist groups say has been affected by illegal mining . 
Brazil ’s Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said during a press conference this week the spread among indigenous groups is " worrisome " and said a national crisis committee has been created to monitor cases in indigenous territories .
