The Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) will meet with member states this week to to discuss preparations for a vaccine as the Americas region experiences its highest levels of new Covid 19 cases , the group 's director , Dr . Carissa Etienne , said Wednesday . 
Etienne said " no vaccine has been approved across our region yet , " but added that a " number of vaccine candidates are under consideration . " 
Speaking during an information session , she warned that when the vaccine is first available to be distributed , there will not be enough for everyone immediately . 
She urged " now is not the time to relax , " as the region faces more than 28.5 million cases and at least 753,000 deaths due to Covid 19 . 
Among the South American countries , Etienne said Brazil is reporting the highest number of new Covid 19 cases with hospitals at capacity in some areas â€” putting the entire health system under strain . 
" These figures and trends make it clear that our region must re double preventive measures , especially in preparation for the year end holidays , " Etienne said .
