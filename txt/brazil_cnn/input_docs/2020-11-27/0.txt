Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Thursday that while his government will distribute the approved coronavirus vaccines free of charge to the population , he personally will not take one . 
Bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the severity of Covid 19 , even after contracting the virus in July , and has raised doubts about future vaccines . 
During his weekly broadcast streamed live on social media Thursday night , Bolsonaro said the federal government would purchase vaccines approved by the regulatory commission Anvisa , and " place them at the disposal of the population for free and on a voluntary basis . " 
He also said that Congress is unlikely to make the vaccine mandatory . 
Brazil has the second highest number of Covid 19 related deaths worldwide and the third highest number of total cases .
