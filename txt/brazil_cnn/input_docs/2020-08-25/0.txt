Brazil 's federal government agency has approved the humanitarian non profit Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) to enter indigenous communities and assist with the coronavirus surge there . 
The approval came Monday for select MSF teams to enter seven Terena people villages of the Aquidauana region , in the midwestern Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul , according to the official Brazilian gazette . 
Some context : Last week , the indigenous association reported that the government did not give permission for the MSF teams to enter Terena 's villages , where more than 6,000 people live , according to the organization . 
The agency said that the plan presented by the organization needed to be evaluated in order to not interfere with their own work . 
Covid has devastated Indigenous communities : By early August , more than 22,000 Brazilian indigenous people had been diagnosed with the coronavirus , and at least 631 had died from it , according to indigenous group APIB . 
But due to limited testing , the real toll could be higher . 
The deaths included prominent indigenous leader Chief Aritana Yawalapiti of the Upper Xingu territory . 
These indigenous communities are often far from hospitals , in areas which often lack basic infrastructure . 
Those who move to towns or cities can end up in precarious living conditions with few public services , increasing their vulnerability to health issues .
