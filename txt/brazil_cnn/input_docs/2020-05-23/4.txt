Ricardo Salles , Brazil â€™s environmental minister , suggested the government should take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to " change all the rules " and " simplify norms " around environmental regulations , a recent cabinet meeting video showed Friday . 
Salles also said during the meeting that the government " would not need Congress " because " they would not get anything approved . " 
The video of the closed door cabinet meeting was released by the Supreme Court Friday , as part of an investigation into accusations that President Jair Bolsonaro interfered in police matters . 
Salles wrote on his personal Twitter Friday , " I always defended de bureaucratization and simplifying the norms in all areas , using common sense and within the law . 
The web of irrational rules impedes investments , the creation of new jobs and the sustainable development of Brazil . "
