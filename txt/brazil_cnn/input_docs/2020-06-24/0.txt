Brazil 's attorney general 's office said Tuesday it was looking to " reverse " a federal judge 's decision ordering President Jair Bolsonaro to wear a mask . 
The attorney general 's office told CNN that it is " already studying all the appropriate measures to reverse the injunction and preserve the independence and harmony between the Powers . " 
The background : On April 30 , the Federal District government issued a decree making the wearing of face masks in public spaces mandatory , in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus . 
Bolsonaro has since appeared in public at several events without wearing a mask , including at rallies with supporters . 
Mask order : On Monday , Federal Judge Renato Borelli issued a decision , ordering Bolsonaro to wear a mask while in public in the country 's capital Brasilia . 
The judge ’s order said failure to do so could potentially lead to a fine of up to 2,000 Brazilian real ( $ 388 ) a day . 
The decision extends to all government employees in the Federal District , where Brasilia is located . 
Brazil is the country with the world ’s second highest coronavirus rate . 
More than 1.1 million cases and at least 52,000 deaths have been confirmed by Brazilian health authorities .
