Brazil marked 50 days without an official health minister today , as the country reports more than 1.5 million coronavirus cases . 
The position is temporarily occupied by Army General Eduardo Pazuello , who has no previous medical experience , since the last Health Minister , Nelson Teich , resigned on May 15 . 
Teich , who spent less than a month in office , left following criticism from President Jair Bolsonaro that he was " too timid in the push to reopen the economy and to advocate for the use of chloroquine . " 
Teich , however , did not provide a reason for his resignation . 
Teich 's predecesor , Luiz Henrique Mandetta — who advocated for social distancing measures , the use of masks , and never clearly recommended the use of chloroquine — was fired by Bolsonaro . 
Bolsonaro , who frequently defies social distancing guidelines recommended by most health experts and has dismissed the virus as " a little flu , " has been widely criticized for downplaying the severity of the virus . 
Under Pazuello 's interim command , more than 20 strategic positions within the ministry have been replaced with military personnel . 
Nonetheless , the greatest criticism against him came when following Bolsonaro 's orders and desire to reduce the negative repercussion of the high death toll , he changed the format of how the data was presented . 
After strong domestic and international pressure , Brazil 's Supreme Federal Court ruled that data should be presented as before . 
Despite the continued rise in Covid 19 cases and related deaths , Bolsonaro shows no signs of planning to replace Pazuello any time soon . 
With more than 1.5 million confirmed cases and at least 63,174 deaths , Brazil has the second highest number coronavirus cases and deaths globally after the US .
