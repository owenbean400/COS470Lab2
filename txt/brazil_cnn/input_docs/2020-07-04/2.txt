Brazil 's President Jair Bolsonaro vetoed on Friday parts of a law that requires people wear face masks in public during the pandemic . 
The use of masks in shopping malls , stores , religious temples , educational establishments and other closed places where people gather will no longer be mandatory . 
Bolsonaro also vetoed fines for those not wearing masks in public sites , as well as to establishments that do not provide masks and hand sanitizer to employees . 
However , states and municipalities have the authority to impose the use of face masks . 
In states like Sao Paulo and Rio , masks have been mandatory and those who do not wear them can be fined . 
Bolsonaro 's move comes as the country surpassed 1.5 million cases on Friday . 
The country ranks second globally with the highest number of cases and deaths after the US .
