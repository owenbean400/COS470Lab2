Brazil is seeking alternatives with other producers if there is a delay in the development and delivery of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and Astra Zeneca , Brazil ’s Deputy Secretary of Health Élcio Franco said . 
" Because it is a purchase based on ( unproven ) technology , there is a degree of uncertainty . 
Although it seems remote to us , there is a possibility of a delay in the vaccine development . 
Even being in the most advanced ( stage ) , we have been looking for alternatives , " Franco said during a news conference on Monday evening . 
In late July , Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello announced his government had the Pfizer and Bio NTech vaccine " on the radar , " after Anvisa ( the country 's National Health Surveillance Agency ) approved the trial in Brazil . 
Pazuello had also confirmed negotiations with the biotechnology company Moderna for a possible priority purchase of their vaccine .
