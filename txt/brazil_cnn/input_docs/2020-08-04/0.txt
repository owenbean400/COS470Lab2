Sunny weather over the weekend in Brazil led to large gatherings of hundreds of people with no social distancing on Rio de Janeiro beaches . 
On Saturday , Rio de Janeiro City Hall began phase five of its reopening plan . 
Under this new phase , swimming and water sports are allowed ; however , individuals cannot remain on the sand . 
Despite this , large groups of people defied the order . 
Around 400 people were asked to leave the sands of Copacabana and Ipanema beaches by the Municipal Guard of Rio de Janeiro , and more than 100 people were fined after being caught not wearing face masks in public . 
The fines cost 107 reais ( $ 20 ) . 
Under phase five , City Hall authorizes the opening of bars , malls and restaurants with extended hours and street shops can also open on Sundays . 
Vendors selling products , food and drinks are allowed on beaches , but the rental of tents and chairs , and the sale of alcoholic beverages is not yet allowed . 
In 55 days of inspection , the Municipal Guard has registered 3,677 sanitary infractions . 
Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella said he is looking into a system for residents to reserve spaces in the sand by using their phones , according to a release from City Hall . 
The project is being discussed at the Secretariat of the Environment and has no implementation date yet . 
The state of Rio de Janeiro has the second highest number of cases and deaths in Brazil . 
Of the 167,225 cases , nearly 50 % belong to the city of Rio de Janeiro . 
Of the 13,572 deaths in the state of Rio de Janeiro , nearly 60 % belong to the city of Rio .
