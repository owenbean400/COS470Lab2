Brazil 's Health Ministry reported 15,654 new cases of coronavirus on Monday , bringing the country 's total to 707,412 . 
Brazil also confirmed 679 new Covid 19 fatalities Monday , bringing the country 's total deaths to 37,134 . 
The ministry on Monday reverted to providing cumulative data on Covid 19 cases and deaths after saying over the weekend that it would no longer provide comprehensive data . 
However , the ministry said the methodology and data would only be available on the website on Tuesday . 
On Saturday , an official Covid 19 tracker from the Brazilian Health Ministry began showing only data on new cases and deaths recorded in the past 24 hours , eliminating running cumulative totals of virus deaths and cases that had previously appeared on the same page . 
The government faced widespread backlash for its decision . 
Brazil â€™s President Jair Bolsonaro tweeted Saturday , " Cumulative data , in addition to not showing that the large part [ of patients ] no longer has the illness , does not depict the moment of the country . 
Other actions are in the works to improve case notifications and diagnostic confirmations . " 
Both the number of new cases and deaths reported on Monday were lower than the previous day but Brazil nonetheless has the second highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide and the third highest number of reported deaths .
