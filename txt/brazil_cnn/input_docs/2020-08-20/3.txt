Brazil ’s President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday he might extend emergency payments through the end of the year for the unemployed , but the payments will be at a lower rate than the current 600 reais ( $ 108 ) a month . 
The latest official figures on unemployment show that a total of 8.9 million people lost their jobs as the coronavirus pandemic swept through Brazil -- representing the sharpest contraction on record for the country . 
Brazil 's unemployment rate rose to 13.3 % for the quarter ending in June . 
Bolsonaro said continuing with 600 reais a month is not an option because it would plunge Brazil into debt , hurting the country 's fiscal credibility . 
Brazil ’s Economy Ministry talked about decreasing the amount to 200 reais ( $ 36 ) a month , Bolsonaro said , but the President said he thinks the amount is too low and suggested they strike a deal somewhere in the middle . 
" It is possible to reach a middle ground and we will seek to extend it for a few more months , perhaps until the end of the year , " Bolsonaro said . 
Meanwhile , the economy minister Paulo Guedes said the economy is recovering in the shape of a Nike " swoosh . " 
" All the indicators show the drop was sudden , rough and strong , but Brazil is coming back , " he said . 
On Wednesday , Brazil confirmed 49,298 new Covid 19 cases and 1,212 deaths in 24 hours . 
At least 111,100 people have died in Brazil from coronavirus and the total number of confirmed cases now stands at 3,456,652 , according to the Health Ministry .
