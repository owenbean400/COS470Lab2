Indigenous Brazilian protesters removed their barricades from a key highway in Brazil ’s Amazon Wednesday to allow for trucks loaded with grains to pass through . 
The Kayapó Mekragnoti people warned they will block the route again on Thursday morning to continue their protest against the government ’s lack of Covid 19 relief . 
The Indigenous Brazilians defied a court order on Tuesday and blocked a key highway for the second time in 24 hours , after reopening it with federal police earlier in the day . 
Why they are protesting : The protesters are demanding health assistance , medical supplies and food to fight the Covid 19 pandemic , and the end of deforestation and illegal activities in their territories , according to the Kabu Institute , an NGO created to manage indigenous villages and inspect the region 's forests . 
Why they chose the highway : Indigenous leaders argue that proximity to the road brought coronavirus to their villages , the Kabu Institute told CNN Monday . 
The first coronavirus cases among the Kayapó Mekragnoti occurred as a result of their contact with urban populations and the presence of illegal miners in their reserves . 
At least 21,000 indigenous people in Brazil have been infected with Covid 19 and more than 600 have died , according to the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( APIB ) .
