On her Twitter account , Joenia Wapichana — the first indigenous woman to occupy a federal deputy seat in Brazil — celebrated the Congress ' action . 
" With the Federal Law number 14.021 restored , the Government of Jair Bolsonaro is OBLIGED , by law and by the decision of the STF [ Federal Supreme Court ] , to give due urgent and emergency attention to prevent a new genocide in indigenous peoples , due to the pandemic " . 
Wapichana was referring to the Supreme Court 's decision which required the federal government to implement safety measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus .
