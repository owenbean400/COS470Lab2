Brazil became the country with the second highest number of cases in the world over the weekend , with daily five figure increases pushing it above Russia and the United Kingdom . 
On Sunday , Brazil reported 15,813 new cases of the coronavirus -- pushing its total to at least 362,000 . 
So far , at least 22,000 people have died in the country . 
Bolsonaro has frequently dismissed the coronavirus threat , calling it a " fantasy " or " little flu . " 
He claims the economic impacts of shutdowns and quarantine measures will have a much more negative effect on the country .
