Far from hospitals and often lacking access to basic infrastructure , Brazil 's indigenous people are dying from Covid 19 at an alarming rate -- and there 's little help in sight . 
The mortality rate is double that of the rest of Brazil 's population , according to advocacy group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( APIB ) , which tracks the number of cases and deaths among the country 's 900,000 indigenous people . 
APIB has recorded more than 980 official cases of coronavirus and at least 125 deaths , which suggests a mortality rate of 12.6 % -- compared to the national rate of 6.4 % . 
While the Health Ministry 's Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health has reported only 695 cases of coronavirus in indigenous communities and 34 deaths , the group monitors a smaller group of people -- only those living in traditional villages and registered at local health clinics , and not indigenous people who have moved to towns and cities . 
Indigenous people who have moved to larger towns or urban areas to study or work can end up in precarious living conditions with few public services , increasing their vulnerability to health issues .
