The director of Brazil ’s biomedical Butantan Institute , Dimas Covas , has said that a " serious , adverse event " suffered by a Sinovac vaccine trial volunteer was unrelated to the trial itself . 
Brazilian health authorities halted the clinical trials of the Chinese vaccine on Monday after the event . 
But he could not provide more details about the event or the volunteer , citing privacy reasons , insisting that regulators had all the information showing that the event was unrelated to the trial . 
Chinese firm Sinovac began the Phase 3 clinical trial of its Corona Vac vaccine in collaboration with the Butantan Institute and the state of Sao Paulo in late July . 
Corona Vac has been at the heart of a political feud between Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and the governor of Sao Paulo , Joao Doria , who is expected to run against him in the country ’s next presidential elections in 2022 . 
While Doria said he hopes to eventually vaccinate Sao Paulo state residents with Corona Vac , Bolsonaro has disparaged the vaccine and has backed a vaccine candidate produced by Oxford University and Astra Zeneca . 
Covas said Tuesday that there was no reason to interrupt Sinovac 's trial . 
On Tuesday , Bolsonaro said on social media that with the suspension of the Sinovac trial the " president wins one . " 
Separately , Sinovac said Brazil 's decision to halt clinical trials was not due to the vaccine itself .
