The Brazilian government said it will not remove employees who recently had contact with President Jair Bolsonaro from the office after he tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Brazil 's General Secretary of the Republic released an official statement saying , " There is no medical protocol , either from the Ministry of Health or the WHO , that recommends isolation measures by simple contact with positive cases . " 
The government offered guidance to public employees , telling them " to seek medical assistance when they experience symptoms related to Covid 19 , to assess the need for testing . " 
If someone is suspected to have symptoms , the government said , " The employees are advised to stay at home until the exams results . " 
More on this : According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , an infected person can start transmitting the virus in the six days before the onset of symptoms . 
WHO recommends that a person who has had close contact with an infected person should spend 14 days in social isolation and away from the workplace . 
Bolsonaro announced Tuesday that he tested positive for Covid 19 after having a reported fever the day before . 
The Brazilian president participated in his normal agenda over the past week , holding meetings with businessmen , politicians and public authorities . 
But after announcing his diagnosis Tuesday in person in front of media , Bolsonaro has worked via video conferences , according to the president 's press office .
