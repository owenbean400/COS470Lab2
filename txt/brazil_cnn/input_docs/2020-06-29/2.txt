The governor of the Brazilian Federal District , Ibaneis Rocha , has signed a decree declaring " a state of public calamity " in the region — which includes Brazil ’s capital Brasilia — due to the rapid advance of Covid 19 cases . 
The measure , published on Monday morning , will stay in place " while the effects of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus persist in Brazil . " 
With the official decree , the Federal District will be legally allowed to receive resources from the federal government , such as social benefits , insurance claims , and the extension of federal loan payments . 
The decree comes at a time of a significant increase in the number of cases of Covid 19 in the Federal District and after rallies both for and against President Jair Bolsonaro took place in the capital . 
Last week , a federal judge ordered Bolsonaro to wear masks at all public events in the Federal District , after he was seen attending public events without one .
