The economic reopening of São Paulo state , the most populous in Brazil , starts today for sectors such as shopping malls , commerce , offices , real estate and car shops . 
There are five phases for reopening , which will be adopted by the mayor of each city as they see fit based on the coronavirus situation in their jurisdictions . 
However , the mayor for the capital city of São Paulo , Bruno Covas , extended the ban on nonessential activities there until June 15 , contrary to the expectations of representatives of industry and commerce . 
Some background : The state of São Paulo has been under quarantine since March 24 . 
The state is the epicenter of Brazil ’s coronavirus outbreak , with more than 100,000 confirmed virus cases and 7,615 deaths . 
Brazil is second only to the United States in its number of coronavirus cases . 
Dr . Carissa Etienne , the director of the Pan American Health Organization , said earlier this week that the Americas have " become the epicenter of the Covid pandemic . "
