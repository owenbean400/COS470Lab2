Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has used an online post to criticize coronavirus lockdown measures and news coverage of the pandemic , in his first comments almost a full day after Brazil surpassed 100,000 coronavirus deaths . 
In a series of tweets Sunday , Bolsonaro pointed to a story published by the UK ’s Daily Mail that criticizes lockdown measures to address the spread of coronavirus . 
The Daily Mail article suggests " it is thought that as many as 16,000 people died because they did not get medical care between March 23 and May 1 . " 
The story claims – without evidence – that those people did not go to hospital during lockdown because they feared catching the virus . 
Bolsonaro went on to criticize Brazil ’s biggest TV station without specifically naming it , saying the TV station " only spreads panic in the population and the discord among the powers " and " disdained , debauched and discouraged the use of hydroxychloroquine . " 
Brazil surpassed 100,000 coronavirus deaths on Saturday and cases in the country are now more than 3 million , according to the latest numbers by the country 's Health Ministry . 
Bolsonaro 's only mention of the 100,000 coronavirus deaths reached in his country on Saturday was to criticize the TV station 's coverage of the topic . 
" In a cowardly and disrespectful manner to the 100,000 dead Brazilians , this TV celebrated that date yesterday , as a true World Cup final , blaming the President of the Republic for all the deaths , " he wrote . 
He added that " misinformation kills even more than the virus itself . 
Time and science will show us that Covid 's political use of this TV has brought us deaths that could have been avoided . "
