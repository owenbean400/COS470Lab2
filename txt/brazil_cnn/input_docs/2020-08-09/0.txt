Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro published a photo of himself on his official Facebook account celebrating the victory of his soccer team , Palmeiras , in the Sao Paulo championship , shortly after the Brazilian Health Ministry announced the country 's coronavirus death toll had surpassed 100,000 . 
The photo shows Bolsonaro wearing a Palmeiras T shirt and making a hand gesture in the shape of a heart . 
A message on the photo reads : " Congratulations Palmeiras champion of Sao Paulo 2020 . " 
Palmeiras won the state title over Corinthians in a game without the presence of spectators Saturday afternoon in Sao Paulo . 
So far , Bolsonaro has not made a public statement about Brazil surpassing 100,000 coronavirus deaths . 
He later attributed the high number of deaths to what he described as an error in diagnosing the cause of deaths in Brazil . 
Brazil â€™s health ministry announced 905 new deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours , bringing the total number of deaths to 100,477 . 
The ministry said there were 49,970 new cases , bringing the total number of cases in Brazil to 3,012,412 .
