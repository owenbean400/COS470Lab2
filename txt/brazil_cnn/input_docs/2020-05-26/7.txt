Brazil inaugurated what it calls the nation ’s first hospital wing dedicated specifically to treat indigenous people infected by coronavirus . 
The " indigenous wing " built at a hospital in Manaus — one of the worst hit cities by the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil — was designed by both indigenous leaders , and local and federal government agencies , Robson Santos da Silva of the Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health ( SESAI ) said at a news conference on Tuesday . 
The wing is designed to replicate the indigenous daily life , with hammocks and special accommodations for tribal leaders , da Silva said . 
Activists have long been demanding a field hospital in Brazil dedicated to the indigenous population , a group they claim are often more vulnerable to diseases because of pre existing conditions or isolation from much of the outside world . 
Activists also argue that the indigenous people are often treated as second class citizens in the country . 
While responding to reporters ' claims that there were some disparities between the number of coronavirus cases and deaths among tribal groups provided by the central government and indigenous advocacy groups , da Silva said , " We have to talk about how many people have been cured as well . 
There were 40 deaths but 300 cured , let 's be positive . " 
The advocacy group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( APIB ) — which tracks the number of cases and deaths among the country 's 900,000 indigenous people — released their own numbers on their official Facebook page on Tuesday , reporting 143 indigenous people have so far died as a result of Covid 19 and more than 1,200 have been infected .
