The new US travel ban on Brazil may affect the diplomatic and economic relationship between the two countries , Sao Paulo Gov . 
Joao Doria told CNN ’s Isa Soares on Tuesday . 
The ban is scheduled to go into effect Tuesday night at 11:59 p.m . ET and will limit the entry of any foreign nationals , including Brazilians , who traveled to the country within the past 14 days . 
Doria said President Jair Bolsonaro was undermining his message and that of governors who represent some of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic . 
" With the example of the president of Brazil , everything is more difficult to us , " he said , because when local authorities ask people to stay home and use masks , the president sends the " opposite message . " 
Bolsonaro has frequently dismissed the threat of the coronavirus and has said the financial impact of preventive measures , such as social distancing and quarantines , will be worse than the virus itself . 
" The behavior of President Bolsonaro is the wrong behavior . 
He is against social isolation . 
He ’s against orientation of the science , " Doria said , adding the priority should be saving lives before saving the economy . 
Doria denied Sao Paulo ’s health care system was near collapse at the moment , saying hospitals have received ventilators and the necessary support , and that the situation " is under control . " 
The state of Sao Paulo has the highest cases in Brazil , with more than 83,000 infections and 6,220 deaths , according to the latest data from the Brazilian health ministry .
