Russia 's annual Victory Day military parade , which was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic , will be held on June 24 , Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in a televised videoconference Tuesday . 
The Victory Day parade , a major celebration to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe , was supposed to be held on May 9 . 
The Kremlin had planned to host foreign leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping . 
Putin was forced to cancel the parade — as well as a public vote on constitutional amendments that could extend his rule until 2036 — as the outbreak in Russia worsened . 
The decision to hold the military parade , the first big public event since the beginning of the pandemic , points to a timeline the Russian authorities envision for lifting quarantine restrictions . 
Putin said specialists believe Russia " has surpassed the peak of the pandemic . " 
The Immortal Regiment march , an event that involves thousands of people across Russia marching on the streets with portraits of family members who died in the war , will take place a month later , in July , as it would not be possible to hold while observing social distancing , Putin said . 
Russia currently ranks third among countries with the most cases of coronavirus , behind the US and Brazil .
