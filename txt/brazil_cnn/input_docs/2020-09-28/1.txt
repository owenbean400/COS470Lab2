Beijing â€™s Municipal Commerce Bureau on Monday called on frozen food importers to avoid importing goods from coronavirus hotspots . 
The bureau added that companies should " strengthen the management of imported cold chain foods and establish and improve early warning and reporting mechanisms for preventing the import of the novel coronavirus . " 
The bureau said the actions were necessary because customs and local authorities across the country have repeatedly detected coronavirus on imported frozen foods , " proving that cold chain foods are indeed at risk of contamination . " 
On Saturday , China Customs said that samples taken from the outer packaging of imported Russian aquatic products in Shandong province tested positive for coronavirus . 
A day earlier , China Customs said the inner packaging of a batch of frozen fish from Brazil also tested positive for the virus .
