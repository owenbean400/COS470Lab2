Questions have emerged in Brazil over the origins of a video highlighting the damage that a coronavirus shut down would likely cause the economy , including whether it is associated with President Jair Bolsonaro . 
The video , which started circulating on Friday , begins with a narrator saying " For Brazil 's nearly 40 million self employed workers , Brazil cannot stop . " 
As images are shown of Brazilians in their workplaces and homes , the narrator continues : " For all the businesses that are stopped and that will end up having to shut their doors or fire employees , Brazil cannot stop . 
… For Brazilians infected with coronavirus , for everyone who depends on care and the arrival of medicines and equipment , Brazil cannot stop . " 
The video ends with the logo of Brazil ’s federal government . 
The video was shared on pro Bolsonaro media accounts , including the official Facebook page of his son Flavio Bolsonaro , a senator . 
But by Saturday , Brazilian media reported that the president ’s social communication secretariat ( SECOM ) had issued a note denying that it was behind any ad campaign called " Brazil Cannot Stop . " 
Congressman Alexandre Padilha , from the center left Workers Party , wrote on his official Twitter account that the ad campaign was " criminal publicity from Bolsonaro . "
