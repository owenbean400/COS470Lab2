A report published Friday from the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases , urges medical professionals to stop using hydroxychloroquine on patients to treat coronavirus , emphasizing that clinicians should focus on effective therapies and resources that are currently lacking in Brazil , like anesthetics , ventilators and additional testing . 
The report , from Brazil â€™s most prominent association of infectious diseases experts , states hydroxychloroquine must be abandoned as a treatment for Covid 19 and underlines that " public agencies should stop spending money on treatments which have been proven to be ineffective and that can cause collateral effects . " 
The association 's recommendation contradicts President Jair Bolsonaro 's public push for the drug . 
Bolsonaro posted a television report on his Twitter account on Saturday in favor of the medicine for treating the virus .
