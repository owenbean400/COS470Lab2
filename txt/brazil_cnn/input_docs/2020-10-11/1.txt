Brazil on Saturday reported 559 new deaths from Covid 19 , raising the country 's total fatalities to 150,198 , according to the National Council of Health Departments . 
After the United States , Brazil is now the second country in the world to reach 150,000 deaths , attributed by critics to the country 's haphazard response to the outbreak , personified in President Jair Bolsonaro 's leadership . 
The actual death toll is believed to be much higher because of low Covid 19 testing capacity in some parts of the country . 
The council also reported 26,749 new cases of the virus on Saturday , bringing the total number of infections in the country to 5.08 million . 
In terms of total cases , Brazil is ranked third worldwide , after the US and India , according to Johns Hopkins University 's tally of cases .
