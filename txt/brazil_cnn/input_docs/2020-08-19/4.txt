Indigenous Brazilian protesters defied a court order on Tuesday and blocked a key highway for the second time in 24 hours , after reopening it with federal police earlier in the day . 
The Kayapó Mekrãgnotire people first blocked a major highway near the city of Novo Progresso in the northern state of Para on Monday , demanding health assistance , medical supplies and food to fight the Covid 19 pandemic . 
They also demanded the end of deforestation and illegal activities in their territories , according to a statement obtained by CNN from the Kabu Institute , an NGO created to manage indigenous villages and inspect the region 's forests . 
Later that evening , a federal judge ordered the protesters to clear the roadblocks or face a daily fine of 10,000 reais ( $ 1,800 ) By Tuesday morning , the indigenous protesters reopened the highway , but warned if the government failed to engage in talks regarding their demands , they would block it again . 
Brazilian Representative Joenia Wapichana released an official letter to Brazil ’s Vice President Hamilton Mourão on Tuesday , urging him to open up a dialogue with the Kayapó Mekrãgnotire people regarding their demands . 
Why they chose the highway : Indigenous leaders argue that proximity to the road brought coronavirus to their villages , the Kabu Institute told CNN Monday . 
The first coronavirus cases among the Kayapó Mekrãgnotire occurred as a result of their contact with urban populations and the presence of illegal miners in their reserves . 
At least 21,000 indigenous people in Brazil have been infected with Covid 19 and more than 600 have died , according to the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil ( APIB ) .
