Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has denied accusations that he tried to downplay the current coronavirus situation in Brazil by not reporting cumulative data . 
The government had stopped reporting cumulative coronavirus deaths and cases , with Bolsonaro arguing they did not reflect the current state of the pandemic in Brazil . 
The Supreme Court , however , later ruled the ministry must provide comprehensive data . 
In a Facebook Live post on his official account on Thursday , Bolsonaro argued the numbers were released , even if they were late . 
He attributed the change to interim health minister Eduardo Pazuello , who he says was changing the way the numbers were presented to be more accurate . 
Allegation of politics in the pandemic : Bolsonaro also argued the brief change in data was aimed to fight supposed political use of the pandemic by local politicians . 
" There are a lot of complaints from the population that we are investigating . 
A person with a health problem dies and in the death certificate it appears as if it was caused by Covid 19 , but the family did not know that he was infected in the first place , " Bolsonaro said . 
" We receive dozens of cases per day like this . 
I do not know what is happening , who profits with that situation ? 
It can only be to gain political power and blame the federal government . "
