Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro , who has called Covid 19 a " little flu " and resisted economic shutdowns to combat the virus , paid a rare tribute to the victims of the novel coronavirus in a Facebook Live on Thursday . 
Sitting near the head of the Brazilian tourism agency , Gilson Machado Neto , Bolsonaro mentions that a popular Catholic festival will not be held in Brazil ’s northeast this year due to " health issues " and referred to the custom of Brazilian radio stations , particularly in the countryside , playing " Hail Mary " on their evening broadcasts . 
After Neto concluded singing , Bolsonaro then turned his attention to a few sheets of paper on the desk in front of him and said : " Let ’s talk about the economy here . "
