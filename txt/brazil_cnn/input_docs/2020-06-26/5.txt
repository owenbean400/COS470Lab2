Brazil began human trials this week to test an experimental vaccine for Covid 19 developed by the University of Oxford . 
Volunteers in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are being given 3,000 shots of the vaccine . 
Doctors , nurses and ambulance drivers are among those recruited for the trial due to their increased risk of exposure to the virus . 
Volunteers are between 18 and 55 years old and must have tested negative for Covid 19 . 
Brazil ’s Health Regulatory Agency ( Anvisa ) gave pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca permission earlier this month to begin the trial . 
The studies of the vaccine could take up to a year , according to the Federal University of Sao Paulo . 
Why this matters : Brazil was selected because it ’s one of the countries hardest hit by the virus . 
Second only to the United States , the country has recorded more than 1.2 million cases and at least 55,000 deaths , according to Brazil ’s health ministry . 
The country has not yet signed a deal to produce the vaccine . 
Human trials of the vaccine are also underway in the United Kingdom , where researchers announced last month that they had moved into the second phase , involving 10,260 participants .
