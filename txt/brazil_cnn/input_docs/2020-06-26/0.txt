Speaking to CNN 's Anderson Cooper and Dr . Sanjay Gupta in a coronavirus town hall , Microsoft founder Bill Gates said the fact that people are still dying in the US today shows that the country is " not even close " to doing enough to fight the pandemic . 
He also expressed disappointment with what he called a lack of US leadership to tackle this virus globally , which has led to developing countries — such as Brazil and India — bearing the brunt of this disease . 
Gates said he remains hopeful that the US will " step up " and help get the tools , particularly the vaccine , out to everyone in the world .
