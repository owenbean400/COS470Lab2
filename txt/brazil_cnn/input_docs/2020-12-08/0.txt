Drugmaker Astra Zeneca 's coronavirus vaccine candidate was found to have 70.4 % efficacy in an interim analysis of Phase 3 trial results , published for the first time in a peer reviewed journal .

" Here , we present the first interim safety and efficacy data for a viral vector coronavirus vaccine , Ch Ad Ox1 n Co V 19 , evaluated in four trials across three continents , showing significant vaccine efficacy of 70.4 % after two doses and protection of 64.1 % after at least one standard dose , against symptomatic disease , with no safety concerns , " the researchers wrote .

The safety data are based on more than 20,000 participants and the efficacy data are based on more than 10,000 participants . 
The study says that across all four studies , " the vaccine had a good safety profile . " 
There were 175 severe adverse events in the trials total : 84 events among those who received the vaccine and 91 in the control group .
