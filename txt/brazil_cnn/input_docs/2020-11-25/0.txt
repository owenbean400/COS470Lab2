The US government ’s Operation Warp Speed effort is trying to understand discrepancies in data coming out of trials of Astra Zeneca ’s experimental coronavirus vaccine , Moncef Slaoui , chief science adviser to the mission , said Tuesday . 
It might be possible to adjust the US trial arm if it turns out a different dose of the vaccine works better , he said . 
Astra Zeneca said Phase 3 trial data from testing in Britain and Brazil indicated the vaccine was 62 % effective -- except for a batch tested in 3,000 volunteers that looked to be 90 % effective in preventing infection . 
The vaccine , developed with the University of Oxford , is also being tested in the US but there ’s no data from that arm of the trial yet . 
Astra Zeneca said surprisingly , the stronger effects were seen in volunteers who got a half dose of the vaccine , boosted by a full dose a month later . 
The 62 % efficacy was seen in the majority of volunteers who got the proper dosing for both shots . 
" We have been made aware of what 's called now the half dose at the time it happened , was a change in the way the quantity of vaccine put in a vial was tested , " Slaoui said . 
He seemed to indicate the half dose was given by mistake . 
" And when they realized there was an error or change in the approach , technique used , they corrected it . 
In the meantime , about 3,000 subjects were recruited , half in the placebo and half in the vaccine group . " 
That would skew the results . 
Clinical trials are carefully designed , and results that came from mistakes usually are not included in the final reports of those trials . 
But clinical trials can be adjusted if mistakes show a different dosing regimen , for instance , can provide better outcomes .
