The number of confirmed deaths from coronavirus in Brazil surpassed 5,000 , according to the latest numbers released by the country ’s health ministry Tuesday . 
President Jair Bolsonaro was questioned by reporters about the spike in the death toll during a late night press gaggle outside the presidential residence in Brasilia Tuesday . 
Bolsonaro responded , " So what ? 
I 'm sorry , but what do you want me to do ? " 
He added that even though his middle name is " Messias , " which translates to Messiah in English , he ’s not " a miracle worker . " 
He later walked back the comments during the same press conference , saying " I ’m sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus . 
We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones , many of whom were elderly . 
But that ’s life , it could be me tomorrow . " 
Bolsonaro has dismissed the threats of the pandemic , calling it a " little flu " and defying stay at home orders imposed by governors by participating in rallies with supporters and hugging people in local supermarkets and bakeries . 
Support for Bolsonaro has eroded amid the pandemic , but according to a poll conducted by Datafolha , 33 % of Brazilians still think he is doing a " good job , " compared with 38 % who think he is doing a " terrible job " or 26 % who think his performance is average .
