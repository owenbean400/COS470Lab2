Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called for the economy to open up , saying that the closures in non essential sectors were " " a terrible disgrace " for the country . 
Speaking in a Facebook live on Thursday , Bolsonaro said that he wants the economy " to run again . " 
" Its been 70 days now that I am saying that we have two problems : life and the virus , of course , but also unemployment , " Bolsonaro said . 
Bolsonaro added that he supported " vertical isolation , " in which elderly and vulnerable people like his mother stay home , but allows " young people " to return to work . 
Controversial president : Critics have lambasted Bolsonaro 's approach to the pandemic , both within the country and internationally . 
Arthur Virgilio Neto , the mayor of a Brazilian city that was badly hit with the virus , called on Bolsonaro to resign . 
Brazil has suffered more infections than every country in the world except the United States , and is yet to reach a peak of cases and fatalities , experts warn .
