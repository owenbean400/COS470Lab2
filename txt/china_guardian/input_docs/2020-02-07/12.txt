A leading UK academic who studies infectious diseases says it is difficult to tell whether the levelling off of coronavirus cases in the past two days is due to an actual decline or just difficulties in recording cases . 
John Edmunds , professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases , London School of Hygiene & amp ; 
Tropical Medicine , said : I think time will tell - it â€™s now about the time we would expect to see if there is an impact of the interventions they put in place . 
We would start to see an effect now if it is having an effect .
