Communist party investigators in China are looking into issues raised by the public about a whistleblower doctor who was threatened by police for sharing his concerns about the virus , from which he later died . 
Following an online uproar over the government ’s treatment of Dr Li Wenliang , the ruling Communist party said it was sending a team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case . 
Li , 34 , was one of eight medical professionals in Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others about the new virus . 
He wrote on Weibo that on 3 December he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to Sars , which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak . 
After he reported seven patients had contracted the virus , he said he was visited by police on 3 January , who forced him to sign a statement admitting to spreading falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued . 
Li later developed a cough and fever before he was hospitalised on 12 January and began to have trouble breathing . 
His death was confirmed on Friday , prompting a deluge of mourning and outrage at the way he and the seven others had been treated . 
Even the staunchly pro government Global Times newspaper said the eight whistleblowers ’ treatment " was evidence of local authorities ’ incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus " . 
Most of the deaths from the virus have been of older people with existing health problems , but disease specialists said Li ’s work may have increased his exposure and made his illness severe .
