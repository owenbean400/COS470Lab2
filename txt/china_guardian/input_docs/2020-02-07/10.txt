Burberry has said the coronavirus is having a devastating effect on the luxury goods market , as wealthy Chinese consumers stay away from shops , and travel restrictions curb overseas shopping sprees , Zoe Wood reports . 
The British company closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China and those that remained open were operating with reduced hours because shopper numbers had plunged 80 % . 
None of the group â€™s employees in China had been diagnosed with the illness , it said . 
The chief executive , Marco Gobbetti , said : " The outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand . 
" While we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last , we remain confident in our strategy . 
In the meantime , we are taking mitigating actions and every precaution to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees . "
