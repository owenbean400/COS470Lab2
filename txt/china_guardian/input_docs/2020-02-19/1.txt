The coronavirus outbreak has temporarily reduced China ’s CO2 emissions by a quarter , according to analysis by Carbon Brief . 
Electricity demand and industrial output remain far below usual levels after authorities introduced stringent measures to stop the spread of the disease . 
Daily data of coal use at power stations is at a four year low , while oil refinery operating rates in Shandong province are at the lowest level since 2015 , the report said . 
Carried out by Lauri Myllyvirta , an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air who covers air quality and energy trends in China , the analysis found levels of NO2 air pollution over China are down 36 % on the same period last year . 
Over the same two week period in 2019 , China released around 400m tonnes of CO2 ( Mt CO2 ) , meaning the measures introduced to control the virus could have cut global emissions by 100Mt CO2 to date . 
However , the report notes that this is likely to only have a short term impact and shutdowns of a week or more are not uncommon in China . 
Cutting energy consumption and emissions by 25 % for two weeks would only reduce annual figures by around 1 % , it states . 
However , reduced consumer demand – potentially caused by unpaid wages during the outbreak – could have a more significant long term effect . 
For instance , car sales are set to fall by 25-30 % in the January February period , according to preliminary forecasts . 
In total , containment measures have resulted in reductions of 15 % to 40 % in output across key industrial sectors , according to the report . 
The virus has had a severe impact on China ’s economy , with Shanghai making a list of companies eligible for millions of dollars in subsidised loans to help keep them afloat . 
In recent days , Chinese industrial hubs have taken measures to stimulate production again , after factories remained closed for around 10 days after the Lunar New year holiday to help with infection control .
