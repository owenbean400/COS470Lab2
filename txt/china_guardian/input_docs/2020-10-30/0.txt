Brazil ’s government will " of course " buy a Chinese Covid 19 vaccine that is being tested in the country , the vice president , Hamilton Mourão , said on Friday , in the latest example of him contradicting the president Jair Bolsonaro . 
Last week , Bolsonaro , a long standing China critic , said the federal government would not buy a Covid 19 vaccine from China ’s Sinovac , one day after the health minister said that it would be included in the nation ’s immunisation program . 
Reuters reports that his comments thrust into the open a simmering debate over vaccine policy between the president and key governors , who have been exploring alternatives to the Astra Zeneca vaccine the federal government has prioritied . 
However , in an interview in the magazine Veja that hit the stands on Friday , Mourão said Bolsonaro ’s stance was without substance , putting it down to a war of words with political rivals , like Sao Paulo state Governor João Doria . 
" The government will buy the vaccine , of course it will . 
We have already put the resources in Butantan to produce this vaccine . 
The government will not run away from that , " Mourão was quoted as saying . 
Sao Paulo state biomedical research centre the Butantan Institute is testing the Sinovac vaccine . 
Doria hopes to have regulatory approval by the end of the year and start vaccinating people in January . 
On Wednesday , Brazil ’s health regulator Anvisa said it had authorised the import of Sinovac ’s raw materials to produce the vaccine .
