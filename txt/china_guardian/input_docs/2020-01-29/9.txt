The World Health Organisation ’s emergencies chief says China is taking " extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge " because of the virus outbreak , the Associated Press reports . 
Dr Michael Ryan said the epidemic remains centred in the city of Wuhan and in Hubei province but that information is being updated and is changing by the hour . 
Many of those affected experience only a mild illness and estimated that the death rate is at about 2 % , he said . 
The death rate for SARS , a related virus , was about 10 % . 
However , the few instances of the new virus spreading between people in countries beyond China , including Germany , are of great concern , Ryan added . 
He said that is part of the reason why the UN health agency ’s director general has reconvened a coronavirus expert committee to meet Thursday . 
It will assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency . 
Ryan made his comments to reporters on Wednesday after returning from a trip to Beijing to discuss the new virus with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders . 
To date , about 99 % of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China .
