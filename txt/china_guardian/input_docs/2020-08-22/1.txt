The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said children aged 12 and over should wear masks to help tackle the corornavirus pandemic under the same conditions as adults , while children between six and 11 should wear them on a risk based approach . 
Children aged 12 and over should particularly wear a mask when a one metre distance from others cannot be guaranteed and there is widespread transmission in the area , the WHO and the United Nations Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) said in a document on the WHO website dated 21 August . 
Whether children between six and 11 should wear masks depends on a number of factors , including the intensity of transmission in the area , the child ’s ability to use the mask , access to masks and adequate adult supervision , the two organisations said , according to Reuters . 
The potential impact on learning and psycho social development , and the interactions the child has with people at high risk of developing serious illness , should also play a role . 
Children aged five years and under should not be required to wear masks based on the safety and overall interest of the child , the WHO and UNICEF said . 
Studies suggest older children potentially play a more active role in transmission of the new coronavirus than younger children , the WHO and UNICEF said , adding more data was needed to better understand the role of children and adolescents in the transmission of the virus , which causes Covid 19 . 
The WHO first advised people to wear masks in public on 5 June to help reduce the spread of the disease , but had previously not issued specific guidance for children . 
More than 23 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally since it was first identified in China last year and 798,997 have died , according to a Reuters tally .
