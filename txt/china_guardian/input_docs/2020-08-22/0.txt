India announced on Saturday that the country has hit the milestone of one million tests per day , with 10,23,836 tests completed on Friday . 
This is the highest in the world outside China and now well above the testing efforts of the United States , the by far worst affected country in the world so far . 
India ’s recovery rate increased to 74.30 % , up from 73.91 % on Friday , as reported by the ministry of health and family welfare . 
This follows Narendra Modi ’s call to rapidly increase testing to 1 million just two weeks ago .
