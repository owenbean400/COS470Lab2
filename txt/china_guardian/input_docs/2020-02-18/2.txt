Jaguar Land Rover ( JLR ) has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks , as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hits firms across countries and industries . 
Britain ’s biggest carmaker joined major global companies such as Apple in warning of the impact of the virus on supply chains , Reuters reports . 
Fiat Chrysler said last week it had temporarily halted output at its Serbian plant , the first such suspension by an automaker in Europe in response to the coronavirus crisis . 
Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province – the centre of the virus outbreak – is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments . 
The JLR chief executive , Ralf Speth , said : We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing . 
We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK . 
Production at the firm ’s Chinese factory would recommence on 24 February and was " safe for the very first week " , he added . 
The new coronavirus has killed over 1,900 people in China and infected around 72,000 , confining millions to their homes , disrupting businesses and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break . 
Speth said sales in China , the world ’s biggest auto market , had been hit . 
The knockback comes after JLR had enjoyed a recovery in sales there , helping it to return to profitability in recent quarters . 
" That ’s completely stopped . 
It ’s zero , " he said . 
" You do not know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss . "
