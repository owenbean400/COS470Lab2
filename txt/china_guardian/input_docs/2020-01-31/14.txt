Following on from the earlier post about health officials urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with two people diagnosed with coronavirus , Public Health England have clarified the definition of close contact . 
A new statement defines close contact as coming within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes . 
Earlier we reported that Sharon Peacock , the director of the National Infection Service at PHE , said : " Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases . 
The two cases were staying in York when they became unwell . 
" Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases . 
" This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public . "
