We are now hearing from the premier of the state of Queensland , Annastacia Palaszczuk , who is calling for national co ordination of the response to the virus . 
Australia is a federal system made up of states and territories and so far each state seems to have had a slightly different response to the virus . 
" There is no reason why the Federal government ca not be on a phone hook up today or over this weekend , talking to all of the ( state ) Premiers giving them the most up to date information . 
This is a serious national issue , " Palaszczuk said . 
An obviously irritated Palaszczuk again makes the point that the national government should be co ordinating the response . 
" I â€™m calling on the Commonwealth ( national government ) to working a spirit of national co operation , to provide information to the states so we can help try to contain this virus , " she says . 
" We would have had a number of planes that have come in from mainland China over the last 1 days . 
Where are all those people ? , " Palaszczuk asks .
