Arkansas senator Tom Cotton , who floated a conspiracy theory which said the Chinese government created Covid 19 in a weapons lab claimed on Saturday that " common sense has been my guide " since he first learned of the outbreak in mid January . 
" Not Chinese communist lies . 
Not ‘ the models ’ . 
Not so called ‘ public health experts ’ . 
Just common sense . 
Many elected leaders have also been guided by common sense . 
Others have not . " 
The virus is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan in which wild animals were sold . 
But in an appearance on Fox News in February , Cotton floated a conspiracy theory which suggests the virus was manufactured in a Chinese bioweapons facility . 
" Here ’s what we do know , " he said . 
" The virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market . 
Epidemiologists … have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market . 
That the virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market . 
" So we do not know where it originated . 
But we do know that we have to get to the bottom of that . 
We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China ’s only biosafety level four super laboratory , that researches human infectious diseases . 
" We do not have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China ’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning , we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says , and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all . "
