I spoke to a British academic who returned from China this week and said that no one from the UK government has tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak . 
Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down about 2,000 people who have flown to the UK from Wuhan , the area worst affected by the outbreak . 
Prof Martin Dove , who works for Queen Mary College London and Wuhan University of Technology , had been working in Wuhan from 3-12 January before heading to other parts of China and flying home on Wednesday . 
After reading that Public Health England wanted to trace all those who had arrived back to the UK from Wuhan in the past 14 days , the physics professor tried to email PHE on various addresses and even emailed the chief medical officer Chris Whitty , but says he has not heard back from anyone . 
Dove told me that although he did not feel unwell , he would like to rule himself out and he believed the government could be doing more to contact those in his position . 
He said : " If they want to track us down , why do not they make it easier for us to contact them ? "
