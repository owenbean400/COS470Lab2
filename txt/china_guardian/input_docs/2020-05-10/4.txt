Overcrowding and outmoded design may have made Canada ’s care homes more vulnerable to Covid 19 , experts have said . 
Jodi Hall , chair of the Canadian Association for Long Term Care , said the pandemic ’s toll has highlighted the chronic problem of government underfunding of long term care homes , CBC reports . 
Many homes maintain four bed , hospital like wards , where residents are separated only by a curtain . 
Around 80 % of all Covid 19 related deaths in Canada have been in long term care facilities , according to CBC . 
In light of the devastating impact on homes , New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh has called for an end to privatised facilities , advocating a universal framework for senior care . 
In an interview aired on its network , CTV reports Singh as saying the government must work to bring long term care under the Canada Health Act and make it federally regulated , while abolishing the private system .
