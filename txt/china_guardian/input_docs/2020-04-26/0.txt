While coronavirus has wreaked havoc in many countries , particularly in the West , Vietnam has practically managed to dodge Covid 19 . 
Although the country is neighbouring China , which was the first epicentre of the outbreak , Vietnam has reported zero deaths from the virus . 
After the first two cases were confirmed in Vietnam in late January , the Communist Party led government cracked down on the problem immediately , and practically sealed the country off from the rest of the world , banning nearly all flights , both domestic and international , and started a surveillance programme to monitor people ’s homes and whether they were buying flu medication . 
Mass quarantines were imposed on people who were sent to camps and hotels with the help of the military . 
To date , Vietnam has reported only 270 infections , and after no new cases had been reported for a week , Vietnamese prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc decided to lift the country ’s social distancing restrictions on 23 April .
