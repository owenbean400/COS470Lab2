Large numbers of dolphins returned to Hong Kong waters within weeks of the Covid 19 crisis shutting down high speed ferries , and researchers are now calling for protections before the ferries resume , Helen Davidson reports .

But researchers say that with the pandemic drastically reducing water traffic , including the suspension of ferries , dolphin numbers in the area have risen by 30 % since March .
