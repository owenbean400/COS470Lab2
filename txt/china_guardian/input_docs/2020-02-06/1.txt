It ’s Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog after hot footing it back from the Department of Health and Social Care ’s press conference , at which England ’s chief medical officer revealed that the third person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK caught the disease outside of China . 
Prof Chris Whitty also said the government was now advising people who had travelled to a number of as yet unspecified Asian countries and had returned to the UK and developed symptoms to immediately self isolate and call NHS 111 for advice . 
Anyone displaying symptoms will be tested for the disease . 
The advice previously only related to those returning from Wuhan . 
Whitty said : " We knew this ratchet up might well happen and this is the moment where we feel it ’s prudent , getting ahead of the epidemiology , to make this shift . " 
He added : What we have got is a situation where very high risk remains in Wuhan and Hubei , a high risk in the rest of China , but much lower than in Wuhan and Hubei and then a much smaller risk in a number of countries , and unsurprisingly countries where the greatest risk is in terms of new cases are the ones which have the greatest international traffic with China , and that is exactly as you would expect .
