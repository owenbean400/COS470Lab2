Tom Phillips , our Latin America correspondent , reports that two Brazilian air force jets are on their way to China to rescue a group of about 34 Brazilian citizens from the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak . 
Brazil ’s state run news agency , Agencia Brasil , says the planes are currently in Poland waiting for clearance from Chinese authorities to continue their flight to Wuhan . 
The delay is reportedly the result of the high number of international repatriation missions trying to fly into the Chinese city . 
Once back in Brazil those being evacuated from Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 18 days at a military base in the city of Anápolis , in Brazil ’s midwest . 
According to the Estado de São Paulo newspaper , Argentina has asked Brazil for help in evacuating 15 of its citizens .
