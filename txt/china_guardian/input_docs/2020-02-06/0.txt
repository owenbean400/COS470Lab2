The WHO director general , Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , and Dr Mike Ryan , the executive director of WHO ’s health emergencies programme , answered some questions from the press . 
When asked to comment on the doctors and nurses striking in Hong Kong to protest the government ’s decision not to close its borders with mainland China , Ghebreyesus said : " This is a time of solidarity . 
There is a common enemy now . 
A very unknown virus . 
And I advise all of us to focus on the virus – the common enemy . 
" I can understand the pressure on health workers and that ’s why Mike said they ’re the heroes . 
I fully agree and I want them to continue being like that . " 
When asked if the world was nearing the peak of the outbreak , Ghebreyesus said : " It ’s too early right now to make predictions on numbers , although we are pleased it is the first day in which the overall numbers of new confirmed cases reported in China have dropped . " 
He added : " We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful on making any predictions . "
