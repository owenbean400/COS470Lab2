There is now confusion surrounding earlier reports that Li Wenliang , the Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak , had died . 
A Communist party controlled newspaper , the Global Times , reported that Li had died earlier today â€“ prompting outrage among many Chinese citizens . 
But the state run newspaper subsequently deleted the report from its official Twitter account and has now claimed Li is still alive . 
" Li Wenliang is currently in critical condition , " the Global Times claimed in the early hours of Friday , local time . 
" His heart reportedly stopped beating at around 21:30 . 
He was then given treatment with ECMO [ extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ] , " it added . 
A post on the official Weibo account of the hospital where Li was reportedly being treated also said he was " currently in critical condition " .
