Hong Kong will start conducting mass coronavirus tests on Tuesday , a health scheme that has been swept up in the political debate dividing the city , where many remain deeply distrustful of both local leaders and China . 
The voluntary tests are part of an attempt to stamp out a third wave of infections that began in late June and saw the densely populated city reimpose economically painful social distancing measures . 
The programme has been hampered by a limited response due to the involvement of mainland Chinese testing firms and doctors - and swirling public mistrust of local authorities as Beijing cracks down on the city ’s democracy movement . 
Since registration began on Saturday , 510,000 people have signed up to take the free tests - around 7 % of the city ’s 7.5 million population . 
More than half of all 141 community test centres across the city are fully booked for their first day on Tuesday . 
But health experts advising the government have said as many as five million people might need to be tested for the scheme to comprehensively uncover hidden transmissions and end the current wave . 
Hong Kong has recorded just over 4,800 infections since the virus first hit the city in late January but about 75 % of those cases were detected since the start of July . 
Tests will run for between a week and two weeks depending on public demand with numbers limited each day to reduce the risk of infection . 
Authorities have billed the scheme as a benevolent public health initiative made possible with Chinese help .
