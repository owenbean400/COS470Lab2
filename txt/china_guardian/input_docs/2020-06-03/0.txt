A China EU summit planned for September in Leipzig has been postponed because of the pandemic , the German government has said . 
The decision was made after the chancellor Angela Merkel held separate phone calls with the Chinese president Xi Jinping and the European Council president Charles Michel , the German government ’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said . 
They agreed that the meeting cannot take place at the envisaged time given the pandemic but should be rescheduled . 
The details should be agreed soon . 
A similar summit that was due to take place at the end of March in China was also postponed . 
Merkel had hoped to used Germany ’s six month presidency of the EU from 1 July to strengthen the bloc ’s ties with China . 
But the fight against the virus and its social and economic impact as well as environmental issues will now be the focal point of her efforts , she has said . 
The EU had wanted to use the summits to push China to deliver on its promise in April last year to give European companies equal treatment and put an end to a practice of forcing foreign firms to share know how when operating in China .
