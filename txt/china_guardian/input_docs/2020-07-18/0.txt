Finance officials from the Group of 20 major economies ( G20 ) vowed on Saturday to continue using " all available policy tools " to fight the coronavirus pandemic and bolster the global economy , but warned that the outlook remains highly uncertain . 
G20 finance ministers and central bankers , in a communique issued after a virtual meeting on Saturday , said the global economy would recover as economies gradually reopen , but said further actions were needed to ensure growth . 
" We are determined to continue to use all available policy tools to safeguard people ’s lives , jobs and incomes , support global economic recovery , and enhance the resilience of the financial system , while safeguarding against downside risks , " they said in statement after the meeting ended . 
Covid 19 , the disease caused by the virus , has infected more than 14.14 million people and killed 596,576 , according to a Reuters tally . 
The United States , the world ’s largest economy , tops the list of deaths . 
Sweeping shutdowns aimed at halting the spread of the disease have caused massive disruption to the global economy , and are hitting the world ’s poorest countries hardest . 
G20 finance officials said 42 of the world ’s 73 poorest countries had requested a freeze in official bilateral debt payments through the end of the year , amounting to about $ 5.3bn in deferred payments . 
Reflecting concerns raised by the World Bank that China , a G20 member and the largest creditor to developing countries , was not participating fully , the officials urged all official bilateral creditors to implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative ( DSSI ) fully and transparently . 
They also " strongly encouraged " private creditors to participate on comparable terms , and said they would consider extending the debt standstill in the second half of 2020 .
