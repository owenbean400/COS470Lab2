Following international pressure , China has vowed to improve the treatment of Africans in the southern city of Guangzhou after facing accusations of discrimination linked to the pandemic , and said it rejected all " racist and discriminatory " remarks . 
Africans in the industrial centre of 15 million say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions , arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing , particularly as Beijing steps up its fight against imported coronavirus cases . 
The African Union expressed its " extreme concern " about the situation , calling on Beijing to take immediate corrective action . 
Meanwhile , the United States denounced what it called " xenophobia towards Africans by Chinese authorities . " 
A recent cluster of coronavirus cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou , southern China ’s largest city , sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus prevention officials . 
Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels . 
" The Chinese government has been attaching great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a statement . 
" The Guangdong ( provincial ) authorities attach great importance to some African countries ’ concerns and are working promptly to improve their working method , " he added . 
Among the measures Zhao announced were non discriminatory health management services and hotels for foreigners who are required to undergo medical observation , to be offered at reduced rates for those in need .
