The Guardian ’s editorial on Covid science and why we should follow the example of the Chinese professor whose selfless decision to share his breakthrough led to the medical miracle of a vaccine . 
There are many people deserving of praise for selfless acts during the past 12 months . 
But one person whose act of scientific generosity ought to be remembered is Zhang Yongzhen . 
The scientist , who works out of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre , was the first to map the whole genome sequence of Sars Co V 2 . 
He did so on 5 January 2020 and hoped to share it with researchers by uploading his work to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) . 
The professor knew he was dealing with a deadly virus – but he had no idea how dangerous . 
The pathogen has killed more than 1.7 million people and shut down nations , leaving a trail of economic disruption . 
Concerned that the NCBI would take its time , the scientist sanctioned the sequence ’s global public release via an Australian colleague . 
On 11 January , when Wuhan recorded its first Covid death , the virus ’s genomic sequence was posted on an open access site . 
The 28,000 letters of Covid ’s genetic code allowed Oxford University ’s Jenner Institute , Moderna and Bio NTech to design their vaccines in days . 
Testing took the rest of the year . 
To go from an unknown lethal new virus to an approved vaccine in months is a medical miracle .
