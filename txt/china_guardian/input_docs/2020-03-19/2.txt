New Zealand â€™s government is set to bail out its majority public owned national airline with more than US $ 500 million in loans . 
Air New Zealand has already stopped most international routes and cut back on domestic flights , but from tomorrow the South Pacific nation will close its borders to all but citizens and residents . 
Air New Zealand said it would subsequently cut its workforce of 12,500 by 30 % . 
The airline is 52 % owned by the government , which has offered loans of 900 million New Zealand dollars ( US $ 511 million ) over two years . 
Finance minister Grant Robertson said that without the intervention , New Zealand was at risk of not having a national airline . 
New Zealand has had 28 confirmed cases of Covid 19 , all connected to international travel . 
There have been no signs yet of a local outbreak .
