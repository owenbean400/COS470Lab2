A massive effort is under way to develop a UK vaccine for coronavirus within months and make it available to save lives before the end of the year , the Guardian has learned . 
Researchers at Oxford University , led by Prof Sarah Gilbert , are planning a safety trial on humans of what is expected to be the UK ’s first coronavirus vaccine next month . 
Provided that goes smoothly , they will move directly into a larger trial to assess how effective the vaccine is at protecting against the infection . 
The same vaccine will start animal trials next week at the Public Health England laboratory at Porton Down near Salisbury . 
Normally , animal work must be completed before human trials can start , but because similar vaccines have worked safely in trials for other diseases , the work has been accelerated . 
Prof Adrian Hill , director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford , said : We are conscious that a vaccine is needed as soon as possible and certainly by June–July , when we expect a big peak in mortality . 
This is not a normal situation . 
We will follow all standard trial safety requirements , but as soon as we have a vaccine that ’s working , we anticipate there will be an accelerated pathway to get it deployed to save lives . 
The more vaccine we can provide sooner , the better .
