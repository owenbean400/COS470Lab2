Speaking at Arrowe Park , where the British citizens brought home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan are headed , the chief executive of Wirral teaching hospital NHS trust , Janelle Holmes , said : There was a lot of preparation that went in for our Wuhan guests who successfully left and had been really appreciative of the support and help that we provided . 
That has given us a blueprint for building on that for the new arrival of guests . 
I was pleased for the staff and partners who had spent such lot of time making sure their stay was as comfortable as possible and clearly I think because we did such a good job we were asked to support this group of travellers that are coming back from a cruise in Japan . 
The group of people is slightly different . 
Obviously they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China but we are working exactly the same as we did before with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe , well managed and comfortable while they are with us . 
Holmes praised the support of the local community – including donations from schools and scout groups – for evacuees based at Arrowe Park and also thanked staff previously living in the quarantine accommodation blocks for their patience as they stay in nearby hotels .
