More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt today after being evacuated from Wuhan . 
None of the people on the aircraft had shown any symptoms of the virus , German Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters . 
" All those returning are currently healthy but to protect them , their personal environment and society at large , it is important that we ensure that nobody is infected , " Spahn said . 
Spahn also warned against hysteria and hostility towards those in quarantine . 
" I am most concerned about conspiracy theories of all sorts that circulate in the social media , which only have one goal , to spread uncertainty . " 
Germany confirmed a seventh case of the coronavirus on Friday .
