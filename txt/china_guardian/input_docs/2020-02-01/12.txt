My colleague Lucy Campbell is at The University of York and says students have been milling about , going to the gym or library as normal . 
Kate Bunting , a second year biology student , said it was " quite scary " to learn they had been staying at the Staycity hotel in York as it is right next to where she lives . 
Kate added she and her friends felt some of the media coverage was scaremongering . 
" I do not think it ’s as scary as it sounds , the fact that there ’s a low risk of further contamination gives me some security and it ’s only because it ’s here that people find it a bit scary . 
" But nobody I know is changing their behaviour because of it and the uni ’s done a good job of updating us throughout the week . 
" It ’s just been a normal day on campus , but quiet , but then it always is on a Saturday . "
