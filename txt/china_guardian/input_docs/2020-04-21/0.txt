Trump : " We have one of the most successful , if you can call it , mortality rates ... 
One person is too many , but we ’ve tested more than any other country in the world , put together . " 
( This is not true ) . 
Trump is now talking about China and the economy . 
He says part of the reason he was elected is that he is touch on China . 
He says the economy was doing really well , then out of nowhere came the " Invisible Enemy " ( I ’m using caps here because he does in his tweets about it ) , " and we ’ll be talking a lot about where it came from . "
