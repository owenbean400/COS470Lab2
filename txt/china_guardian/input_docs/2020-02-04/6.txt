Canadian police have arrested a man on a charge of " mischief " after he falsely told passengers and crew on a Jamaica bound flight he was infected with coronavirus , forcing the plane to turn back mid flight , reports Leyland Cecco from Toronto . 
The West Jet plane departed Toronto Monday morning for Montego Bay . 
Two hours into the flight — halfway to its destination — the 29 year old man told passengers he had recently visited China and contracted the virus . 
Flight crews quickly gave the man a mask and rubber gloves , requesting he move to the back of the plane . 
" Out of an abundance of caution , our crew followed all protocols for infectious disease on board , including sequestering an individual who made an unfounded claim regarding coronavirus , " West Jet said in a statement . 
After the pilot was made aware of the situation , the plane turned around midair . 
Because the passenger ’s claims of recently visiting China barred the flight from landing in the US , the pilot was forced to return back in Toronto , where police and medical crews were waiting . 
Peel police told reporters the man ’s claim of a coronavirus infection were determined to be " unfounded " . 
He was subsequently charged with mischief and is set to appear in court 9 March . 
West Jet apologized to frustrated passengers , placing them on a new flight that departed early Tuesday morning .
