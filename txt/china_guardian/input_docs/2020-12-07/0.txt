The president of Sao Paulo ’s Butantan Institute biomedical center , Dimas Covas , said all necessary data for the Corona Vac vaccine developed by China ’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd has been or will soon be sent to health regulator Anvisa . 
He expects Anvisa to approve it , regardless of the political storm between Brazil ’s President Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria over competing vaccines . 
I want to think that no political problem is bigger than people ’s lives , " Covas said in an interview with Globo News . 
Doria said earlier on Monday that the country ’s most populous state plans to start vaccinating its population against COVID 19 on January 25 . 
The federal government expects to roll out its own immunisation plan at least a month later . 
Doria ’s ambitious timeline comes even though the Sinovac vaccine has yet to be approved by Anvisa .
