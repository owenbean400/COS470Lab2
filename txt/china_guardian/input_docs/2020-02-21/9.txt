The director of Wuhan Women ’s Prison has been removed from her position , according to the Hubei Daily , where it ’s believed 230 inmates have tested positive for Covid 19 . 
Another 41 prisoners in Shayang Hanjin prison , also tested positive , according to reports in the Hubei Daily . 
Hubei Daily : 271 prisoners in Hubei are infected with # covid19 among which 230 are in Wuhan Women ’s Prison and 41 are in Shayang Hanjin Prison . 
Head of the women ’s prison has already been sacked and an officer in Hanjin was given serious warning for omitting contact history . 
The Global Times has reported on new cases in prisons in two other provinces ( 202 in Shandong , 28 in Zejiang ) . 
By my calculation that adds up to 500 new cases in prisons across three provinces .
