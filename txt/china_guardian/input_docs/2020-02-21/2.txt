Just doubling back on those figures for the virus in China ... there were 889 new confirmed cases reported in Friday ’s national briefing from the country ’s health commission , which is a jump up from the 394 reported the previous day . 
The total number of infections stands at 75,465 . 
You may recall that the way China reports cases changed again yesterday , to remove patients who had been clinically diagnosed ( by a doctor/scan ) who had subsequently tested negative for the virus . 
This appeared to influence the trend down on Thursday , compared to Wednesday . 
Trying to establish trends on a day to day basis is difficult , but generally , it would seem new cases are trending down , as you can see in the Johns Hopkins University graph of confirmed cases below . 
On Friday China reported 118 deaths ( on Thursday it was 114 ) , taking the total number of fatalities to 2,236 .
