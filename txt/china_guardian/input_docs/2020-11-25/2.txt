Turkey recorded 28,351 new cases in the last 24 hours , the health minister Fahrettin Koca has said . 
It is the first time since July that Ankara has included asymptomatic cases in the total . 
The government had only been reporting symptomatic cases since the summer , which critics said masked the true scale of the outbreak . 
Data from the Health Ministry showed on Wednesday that 168 people had died in the last 24 hours ; the most since the beginning of the outbreak . 
Koca said Turkey has signed a contract to buy 50m doses of vaccine from China ’s Sinovac Biotech . 
They are due to be delivered in the months of December , January and February , he has told a news conference . 
Sinovac ’s experimental vaccine Corona Vac triggered a quick immune response but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the virus , preliminary trial results showed . 
Corona Vac and four other experimental vaccines developed in China are in late stage trials to determine their effectiveness . 
Speaking in Ankara after a science council meeting , Koca said Turkey is also in talks with other vaccine developers . 
The important thing here for us to start using vaccines which are known to be effective and reliable ... 
I think the vaccination calendar could start on 11 December .
