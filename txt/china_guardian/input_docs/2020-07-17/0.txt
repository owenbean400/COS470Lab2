Donald Trump has commended Australia ’s $ 270bn defence budget boost and discussed China ’s " unfair retaliatory trade measures " and threats to Indo Pacific security , in a phone call with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison . 
The US president also thanked Morrison for seeking World Health Organisation reform and an investigation into the origins of the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Morrison described the president ’s call as " very complementary " . 
The defence budget boost meant Australia was no longer a passenger in its defence relationship with allies " and that is greatly appreciated by our American friends " , the prime minister said . 
The phone call came as Trump , US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and other key members of the president ’s administration ramp up rhetoric and measures against China . 
Pompeo has repeatedly pointed to China ’s " coercion " in hitting Australia with steep barley tariffs and beef export bans after Morrison led global calls for the Covid 19 probe .
