AFP has a report from an overwhelmed sounding hospital in Wuhan : At one Wuhan hospital AFP visited , there were long queues of sick patients , many coughing , with overwhelmed staff unable to process them quickly . 
Outside the Red Cross facility - which is one of the hospitals people are sent to for initial tests if they show signs of infection - patients told AFP they felt exasperated and helpless . 
" It has been two days since I slept , and I have been wandering from hospital to hospital , " said a man in his 30s , who was trying to see a doctor because he was worried he might be infected . 
" At this rate , my turn will be tomorrow morning at best . " 
Those who spoke to AFP told of extremely long queues and disorganisation . 
One spoke of a fear that sick patients with fevers will infect each other while waiting in long queues , even if they did not have the coronavirus when they first arrived at the hospital . 
Another man said he had seen several people faint while waiting . 
Many people carried their own plastic stools to sit on , while one pragmatic man had brought a lounge chair with him . 
" It takes at least five hours to see a doctor , " one woman , who did not want to be named , told AFP . 
The woman , who was with her son , said the management of the hospital was " really messy " . 
An old man wearing a Mao cap said he had waited all day to see a doctor , only to be sent home because of a " lack of room " . 
AFP saw some patients inside the hospital who were without masks , despite city orders that anyone going out must wear them . 
Patients were taking their own temperatures with mercury thermometers , by mouth or armpit , and there were no checks on anyone entering or leaving the hospital . 
" There is no more space , the staff are overwhelmed , there is a shortage of some medicine , and patients are being left to fend for themselves , " said one 30 year old .
