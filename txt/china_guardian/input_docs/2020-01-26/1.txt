World Animal Protection has welcomed China ’s decision to impose a wildlife trade ban , effective from today . 
Kate Nustedt , the organisation ’s global wildlife director , said : We commend China ’s decision to impose a nationwide ban on wildlife trade in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak . 
This ban will prevent the terrible suffering endured by millions upon millions of wild animals across the country . 
Crucially , it will also put a stop to the horrific conditions that serve as such a lethal hotbed of disease . 
We hope that this courageous step is made permanent and extended to all wildlife imports and exports , to help prevent any future crises of this nature . 
Wild animals belong in the wild . 
This wildlife trade ban by China will help keep them there .
