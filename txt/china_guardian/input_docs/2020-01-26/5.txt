Earlier , I reported on protests in Hong Kong against a plan to turn a newly built but currently empty public housing block in Fanling into a quarantine facility for people with coronavirus . 
Here ia an update from AFP : Dozens of local residents and protesters opposed to the idea held rallies outside the complex on Sunday , with some setting up road blocks . 
In the evening , police said assailants threw petrol bombs at the buildings . 
An AFP photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control . 
Riot police were on scene and protesters had left , although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray . 
The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended . 
The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility . 
Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities . 
But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated . 
The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro democracy protests .
