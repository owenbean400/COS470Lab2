All indoor sports and entertainment venues were shut down in China â€™s capital Beijing on Monday as authorities raced to contain a fresh coronavirus outbreak linked to a wholesale food market , with some neighbourhoods placed under complete lockdown . 
Tens of thousands of people were also targeted in a massive test and trace programme , according to Agence France Presse . 
As we reported earlier , the World Health Organization said that more than 100 cases had been confirmed so far . 
The outbreak came after China had largely brought the virus under control following its emergence in the central city of Wuhan late last year , highlighting the global risks associated with a second wave of infections .
