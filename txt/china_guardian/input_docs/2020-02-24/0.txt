All nations must work together to fight the spread of the coronavirus and prevent a crisis with " dramatic consequences " for global health and the world economy , the UN ’s secretary general , António Guterres , has said . 
Guterres , speaking to reporters during a visit to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) centre for managing emergencies , called for full funding of the body ’s appeal for $ 675m ( £ 522m ) to cover its overall response for three months . 
Following a briefing with the WHO ’s director general , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , and other senior officials , Guterres said : All countries – and this is now a problem that is affecting many countries in the world – all countries must do everything to be prepared . 
The disease it ’s still possible to contain but if some fail , if some do not do everything that is needed , this can still become out of control with dramatic consequences in global health and the global economy . 
He said the decline in new cases of coronavirus in China was a good trend which he hoped could be maintained .
