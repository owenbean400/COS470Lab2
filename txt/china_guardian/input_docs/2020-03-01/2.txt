Christopher Betts , 73 , is a British holidaymaker who is still in lockdown in the hotel in Tenerife . 
He arrived at the hotel with his wife on the 18th , and was due to be leaving on the morning the hotel went into quarantine . 
Christopher told the Guardian he has been tested for coronavirus but has not received his results , and has no idea when he ’ll be able to fly home . 
One of his friends in the hotel is in regular contact with the Foreign Office , and says he ’s being told different things depending on which member of staff he speaks to there . 
" One branch of Foreign Office says that when you ’re negative you can go , another branch says you have to stay for the full isolation period , until March 10 , " he said . 
" We ’re operating on a Chinese whispers system . 
If we have to stop til next Tuesday , fine , we ’ll accept it . all we need is clarification . " 
" We ’re getting conflicting stories from our government . 
Finish and Dutch people in the hotel have said their government have been clear about them staying until the 10th , but we do not know , " he added . 
Those who test negative will have to retest when the time comes to fly home , and must leave 24 hours after their negative result . 
Christopher is concerned that if the remaining Brits are allowed to leave the hotel , they wo not be able to get transport to the airport . 
He praised the staff at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace for their hospitality during the quarantine period . 
" You could not wish for a better hotel , " he said . 
" Staff and guests were dancing in the restaurant last night , they brought us entertainment . 
I know people whinge , but you could not wish for anything more under the circumstances . 
They ’re even giving us free drinks . "
