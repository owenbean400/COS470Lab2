The first comprehensive study of Covid 19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients once they reach middle age . 
The analysis found that while the overall death rate for confirmed cases was 1.38 % , the rate rose sharply with age â€“ from 0.0016 % in the under 10s , to 7.8 % in 80s and over . 
The study showed only 0.04 % of 10 to 19 year olds required hospital care compared with more than 18 % of those in their 80s and above . 
Dramatic rises were seen among middle aged groups too , with 4 % of people in their 40s needing hospital treatment and more than 8 % of patients in their 50s .
