Thousands of medical staff in Hong Kong have gone on strike in a bid to get the government to completely seal the border with mainland China , AP reports . 
Hong Kong ’s hospital authority says 4,600 medical staff , mainly nurses , did not turn up for work on Wednesday . 
The medical union disputes the authority ’s figure and said about 7,000 people took part in the strike . 
The group wants the government halt cross border travel and prevent the spread of a new virus . 
Opposition lawmakers have criticised the decision of Hong Kong leader , Carrie Lam , to quarantine all people arriving from the mainland for 14 days instead of shutting the remaining two land border checkpoints . 
They said it could lead to more people from the mainland coming to Hong Kong to seek treatment that would further burden the city ’s already taxed medical facilities .
