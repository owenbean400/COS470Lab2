Rachael Maskell , the MP for York Central , has criticised the government ’s response to the coronavirus outbreak . 
York Press reports that Maskell called on the Government to ‘ get a grip ’ after it emerged that the York student with coronavirus spent a night in student accommodation . 
" The student did access student accommodation—Vita Student accommodation—despite our being told they had not , " she said through a point of order in the House of Commons . 
" There is confusion over how information is being gathered and shared , which could have a serious impact on public confidence in how the coronavirus is being managed . " 
Maskell added : " The government need to get a grip as we may be in the early stages of the management of this infection . "
