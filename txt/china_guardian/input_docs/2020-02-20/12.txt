Our health editor , Sarah Boseley , reports that 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries have signed a joint statement of support for Chinese colleagues who are being criticised on social media , and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about the origins of the coronavirus . 
" We work very closely with the Chinese scientists . 
We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years , since Sars , " said Dr Peter Daszak , the president of Eco Health Alliance in the United States . 
" We collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world . 
That is all under threat right now . " 
There is a worry that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end , impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid 19 . 
The scientists cite conspiracy theories circulating on social media which claim that the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research . 
They are " crackpot theories that need to be addressed , but in the age of social media it is just impossible " , Daszak said .
