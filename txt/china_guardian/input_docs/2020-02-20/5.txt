Sources have told the PA news agency that the Britons in Cambodia who left the Westerdam cruise ship are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home . 
They are being quite coy about it though â€“ refusing to disclose how many Britons are involved , or indeed whether they may have already arrived back in the country . 
The group , who have all tested negative for coronavirus while in Cambodia , are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings . 
Public Health England said airport health teams would meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms , and they would be asked to self isolate at home for 14 days .
