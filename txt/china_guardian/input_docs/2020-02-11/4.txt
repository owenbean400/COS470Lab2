Hundreds of workers have been made redundant in China as the country â€™s economy reels from the coronavirus outbreak . 
Chinese firms struggled to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday , hundreds of them saying they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat . 
Company layoffs were beginning despite assurances by President Xi Jinping that widespread sackings would be avoided , as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured . 
Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people , or just over a tenth of its workforce , and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers . 
Authorities said they would roll out measures to stabilise jobs , in addition to previously announced cuts to interest rates and fiscal stimulus designed to minimise any downturn . 
The World Bank ruled out any new health loans to China , though technical assistance would be offered .
