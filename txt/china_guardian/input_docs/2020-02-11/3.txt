Singapore expects a 25-30 % drop in visitor numbers this year due to the coronavirus outbreak , its tourism board has said . 
Singapore has reported 45 cases of the virus , and some countries , such as Kuwait and Qatar , have already started advising their citizens against travel to the Southeast Asian business hub . 
" The situation this year will be at least as severe as Sars and possibly worse , " Singapore Tourism Board chief executive Keith Tan said , referring to a 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that killed over 30 people in Singapore . 
Tan said most of the reduction in visitors so far were from China due to travel restrictions , but that travellers from other countries were also deferring or cancelling trips to Singapore . 
The Singapore government has said it expects a hit to its economy from the virus and is planning measures to support the tourism and hospitality industry . 
Fitch Ratings estimates the tourism sector accounts for about 6 % of the wealthy city state â€™s economy .
