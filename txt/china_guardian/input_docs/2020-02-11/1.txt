The first coronavirus vaccine could be available in 18 months , " so we have to do everything today using available weapons " , the World Health Organization chief , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , said in Geneva . 
Last week , Thomas Breuer , chief medical officer of Glaxo Smith Kline â€™s vaccine unit , said : " It will take at least 12 to 18 months , which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit . " 
At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines , or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected . 
Ghebreyesus urged countries to be " as aggressive as possible " in fighting the newly named Covid 19 coronavirus . 
If the world does not want to wake up and consider the virus as public enemy number one , I do not think we will will learn from our lessons . 
We are still in containment strategy and should not allow the virus to have a space to have local transmission .
