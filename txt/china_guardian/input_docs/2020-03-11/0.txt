And before we leave that Australian press conference , one final word from the chief medical officer , professor Brendan Murphy , on the policy of not testing for coronavirus people who are a ) not symptomatic and b ) have not recently returned from overseas or been in contact with a confirmed or suspected case . 
Murphy said : We ’re not testing people without symptoms at the moment . 
There is no value in testing people without symptoms . 
Currently , our approach is testing — and that ’s the international approach — is testing people who have respiratory symptoms and who have been a returned traveller or who are a contact . 
Murphy said the focus in Australia was building testing capacity so there can be a same day turnaround on testing results . 
He said the reason there is " no value " in testing people who are asymptomatic is that a negative test result does not mean that a person is not incubating the virus . 
So before a person is symptomatic the test can return , essentially , a false negative .
