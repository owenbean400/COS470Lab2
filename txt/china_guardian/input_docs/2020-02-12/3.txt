Mobile World Congress , one of the most important events in the tech industry calendar , has been cancelled due to concerns over the global spread of the coronavirus , organisers have said . 
The news comes after a series of big names – among them Facebook , Cisco Systems , and Intel – pulled out of the conference citing similar concerns . 
Spanish and Catalan authorities had insisted it would go ahead . 
John Hoffman , the chief executive of the event ’s organiser – the GSMA – has said : With due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country today , the GSMA has cancelled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak , travel concern and other circumstances make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event . 
He added that his " sympathies at this time are with those affected in China , and all around the world " .
