Asked about reports that the Chinese authorities silenced those warning of the virus at the end of last year , Dr Michael Ryan says that the country ’s government notified WHO as soon as there was evidence of the outbreak . 
He said that given the country ’s huge population and the fact that the symptoms are so similar to influenza , the speed of the identification of the outbreak was impressive . 
" Now is not the time for recrimination , now is not the time for forensics , now is the time to fight this virus , " he said .
