Eight of the nine patients in the UK who tested positive for the coronavirus have been discharged , NHS England has confirmed . 
The last of those being quarantined at Arrowe Park after returning from China have left hospital , NHS England added . 
More than 100 people remain in isolation at the Kents Hill Park Hotel , Milton Keynes . 
Prof Keith Willet , NHS strategic incident director , said : The last guests have left Arrowe Park hospital and I would once again like to thank them for the calm , patient and responsible way that they have responded to what must have been a trying situation . 
Over the coming weeks many more of us may need to spend some time at home to reduce the spread of the virus and they have set a great example . 
I would like to thank all those NHS staff and partners , as well as Public Health England , who have worked so hard to make their stay as comfortable as possible , those still caring for guests in Milton Keynes and all the doctors , nurses and other healthcare professionals who have successfully treated patients at other hospitals . 
We must not forget the local residents , council staff , volunteers and numerous others who have rallied round to help our guests in their time of need . 
Thank you all .
