The Finnish government is setting up a three week blockade of the Uusimaa region around Helsinki to prevent people from travelling and spreading the virus to other parts of the country , it has said . 
The decision came after the Finnish health authority worsened its forecast for the outbreak , estimating that between 11,000 and 15,500 people would be hospitalised and that between 3,600 and 5,000 of them would require intensive care in the following months . 
Authorities have counted three deaths and 880 confirmed Covid 19 cases in Finland ; most of them in the capital region .
