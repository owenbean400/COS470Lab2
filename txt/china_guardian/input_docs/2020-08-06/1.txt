US president Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak , as his health secretary headed to Taiwan for a visit sure to irk Beijing . 
Trump , whose public approval ratings have fallen amid continued Covid 19 infection rates and economic woes , sought to shift the focus to Beijing , claiming again , without evidence , that it may have intentionally let the virus spread globally . 
The Republican president , who is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in national polls ahead of the 3 November election , said it was a " disgrace " that Beijing had limited the spread of the virus at home but allowed it to reach the rest of the world . 
" What China did is a terrible thing ... whether it was incompetence or on purpose , " he said , reviving a refrain that has strained ties between the world ’s two largest economies and raised questions about a US China trade deal signed in January . 
Biden on Wednesday said the deal was " failing " after Commerce Department data showed the US China trade deficit widened 5 % to $ 28.4bn in June . 
Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday aimed at yanking back supply chains from China for key ingredients and supplies used to make medicines and medical equipment , said Peter Navarro , a key adviser and China hawk . 
Trump ’s health secretary , Alex Azar , is due to visit Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province , starting Sunday and reaffirm the US partnership with the Asian country , prompting China to threaten " strong countermeasures . " 
Azar will be the highest level US official to visit the island in four decades . 
Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favor of Beijing but is now moving to sell Taiwan at least four of its large sophisticated aerial drones .
