More than 300 Brazilians gathered on São Paulo ’s main commercial thoroughfare on Sunday to protest state governor João Doria ’s support for mandatory Covid 19 immunisation and testing the potential vaccine developed by China ’s Sinovac , Reuters reports . 
Doria has previously spoken in favour of making immunisations mandatory , once vaccines are available , sparking a spat with President Jair Bolsonaro who vows it will be voluntary . 
The Supreme Court ’s chief justice has said the court will ultimately decide on the issue . 
A number of vaccines are obligatory in Brazil , including for example Hepatitis B which is given to newborns . 
Brazil has had great success with large vaccination campaigns in the past , eradicating polio in the 1980s for example . 
In São Paulo , the Sinovac vaccine is being tested as part of phase III clinical trials with support from the Doria government . 
Brazil ’s federal health ministry announced last month it would buy 46 million doses of the vaccine , contingent on regulatory approval , in a deal supported by state governors . 
But a day later right wing President Jair Bolsonaro said that Brazil would not buy the vaccine . 
Bolsonaro has bashed China intermittently since the campaign trail in 2018 , over the country ’s growing investments and influence in Brazil .
