Chinese state television ’s traditional lunar new year extravaganza on Friday paid tribute to the people of Wuhan and to medical staff fighting the coronavirus crisis , urging them on to victory in the battle to defeat the outbreak , Reuters reports . 
Traditionally , hundreds of millions of people gather around their televisions to watch the CCTV Spring Festival Gala , a more than four hour showcase of skits , music and dance that has been a TV staple since the first edition was broadcast in 1983 . 
This year an extra segment was added at the last minute to what is normally a carefully planned show , slotted in early in the broadcast . 
The hosts offered their best wishes to medical staff on the frontlines and to the people of Wuhan . 
" We will definitely be victorious ! " the hosts announced in unison . 
After a montage showing doctors and nurses in their hospitals donning protective gear and hard at work looking after their patients , the hosts read out further exhortations . 
Bai Yansong , one of state television ’s best known anchors , told the gala the virus segment had been prepared very shortly before the actual show . 
" Remember that we love you , not just today but every day in the future , " Bai said as the camera cut to an audience member with tears streaming down her face . 
Bai ’s colleague Kang Hui , who often reads the main evening news , said the whole nation was involved in the virus fight . 
" There is no predicament we cannot get over , " Kang said , to stirring music against a backdrop of more scenes of medical workers in protective body suits .
