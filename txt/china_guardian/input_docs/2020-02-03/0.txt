Hello , this is Michael Safi , I ’ll be updating you with the latest developments in this story over the next hours . 
We ’re getting a little more now from the press conference ( given online , not in person ) by the Chinese foreign ministry . 
The government has been at pains to emphasise that it has the tools to control the spread of this coronavirus outbreak , but this morning did concede it needs help – in the form of protective medical equipment . 
" What China urgently needs at present are medical masks , protective suits and safety goggles , " the foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press briefing on Monday morning . 
China ’s factories can produce 20 million masks a day , but panic over the virus has prompted people in the country of 1.4 billion to stock up on them , while frontline medical personnel have reported equipment shortages . 
Agence France Presse provides this context : At full capacity , China ’s factories are only able to produce around 20m masks a day , according to the ministry of industry . 
The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea , Japan , Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies . 
Tian Yulong , of the industry ministry , said earlier on Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe , Japan and the US , adding that supply and demand in China remained in " tight equilibrium " as factories returned to production after the lunar new year break . 
He said they were now operating at between 60 % and 70 % capacity . 
In addition to Hubei , the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak , several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public . 
These include Guangdong – China ’s most populous province – plus Sichuan , Jiangxi , Liaoning and the city of Nanjing , with a combined population of more than 300 million .
