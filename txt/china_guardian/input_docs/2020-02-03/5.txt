As researchers are racing to develop a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus , the British drugmaker GSK has teamed up with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) to aid efforts to produce a vaccine . 
GSK , one of the world ’s biggest vaccine makers , says it will make its " adjuvant platform technology " available . 
An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to improve the immune response and means the amount of antigen required per dose can be reduced – allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people , which is crucial in a pandemic . 
Dr Richard Hatchett , the chief executive of CEPI , says : Gaining access to GSK ’s world leading adjuvant technology is a huge step forward in developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus 2019 n Co V . Coupling GSK ’s adjuvant systems with the pioneering platform technology we are funding has the potential to make more vaccine available more rapidly – by decreasing the dose of vaccine antigen required to protect each individual . 
CEPI , a public private group based in Norway , is one of several organisations working on a vaccine . 
It has committed $ 11m to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna , and the University of Queensland , with the hope of having a viable vaccine in production within 16 weeks , although testing for safety and efficacy will take much longer . 
Meanwhile , a research team at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland has prepared a modified version of a key section of the virus to encourage the body to produce antibodies against the disease . 
And France ’s Pasteur Institute said last Friday that it had set up a taskforce aimed at developing a vaccine against the virus within 20 months .
