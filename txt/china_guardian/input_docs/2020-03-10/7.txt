The state control centre will be used to coordinate the response between state and federal health authorities , and manage the output of public information . 
Victoria has also set up seven screening clinics for people who believe they may have coronavirus : Royal Melbourne Hospital , Alfred Hospital , Austin Hospital , Box Hill Hospital , Monash Clayton , Northern Hospital and Sunshine Hospital . 
Those clinics screened 1,039 people on Tuesday and the state coronavirus hotline fielded 14,500 calls .

Two schools — Carey Baptist Grammar School and Yeshivah Beth Rivkah College , both in Melbourne — have been closed after teachers tested positive . 
Authorities are trying to trace 45 people who came into contact with a teacher at Yeshivah Beth Rivkah College , anyone who may have been on a flight from San Francisco to Melbourne on which another woman later tested positive to Covid 19 . 
They are also trying to trace people who may have come into contact with the third person to test positive overnight . 
That man went to a jazz festival in the South Melbourne markets on 7 March and a rugby union on the same day .
