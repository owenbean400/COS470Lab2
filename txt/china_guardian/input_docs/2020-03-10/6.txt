Here ’s a little more reaction from Nadine Dorries to the news of her diagnosis : Thanks for so many good wishes . 
It ’s been pretty rubbish but I hope I ’m over the worst of it now . 
More worried about my 84yo mum who is staying with me and began with the cough today . 
She is being tested tomorrow . 
Keep safe and keep washing those hands , everyone .
