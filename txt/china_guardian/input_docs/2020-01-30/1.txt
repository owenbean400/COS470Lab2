The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have confirmed that following a last minute decision from China , dependents of British nationals and dual nationals will be allowed on to the evacuation flight . 
Previously , restrictions imposed by China meant those with Chinese passports were not permitted to leave the country , and China does not recognise dual nationality . 
The U turn meant that Matt Raw and his 75 year old mother Hazel were given permission to fly along with Raw ’s wife Ying , who holds a Chinese passport . 
It ’s uncertain whether other families in similar situations have been given the go ahead to board the plane , or whether they have been able to make it to the airport in time .
