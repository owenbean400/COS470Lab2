Brazil has asked Chinese authorities to provide results of laboratory tests that detected traces of Covid 19 on chicken wings exported by the South American country , according to a statement sent to Reuters by Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry . 
The request was made during a meeting in the city of Shenzhen , in Guangdong province , where Brazilian agriculture attachés met local health and trade officials on Tuesday , the statement said . 
In response , according to the statement , the Chinese participants said the results are being kept by health authorities of Guangdong , who did not participate in the meeting . 
The Brazilians said they would continue to liaise with China ’s municipal , provincial and central governments to obtain the lab reports as well as other relevant information pertaining to the case . 
The contamination claim concerns chicken wings produced at a Brazilian poultry plant . 
Aurora , the company which operates the facility in Southern Brazil , voluntarily suspended poultry exports to China effective 20 August pending more clarifications regarding the alleged contamination . 
According to the Brazilian government , Chinese officials at the meeting said three samples had tested positive for Covid 19 : one taken from the chicken wings , and two from the packaging of products coming from Aurora ’s plant in the town of Xaxim . 
" The health authorities in Shenzhen were unable to say whether the findings concerned only the detection of the virus ’ genetic material or the active virus , nor were they able to provide further information about the alleged finding , " the statement said . 
The alleged contamination led the Philippines to impose a temporary ban on poultry meat imports from Brazil while Hong Kong halted chicken imports from Aurora ’s Xaxim facility .
