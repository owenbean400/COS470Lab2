Social distancing appears to be keeping the coronavirus at bay in a Canadian province — a rare moment of positive news as cases around the world continue to surge . 
" I ’m trying not to over call it , but I do believe we ’ve seen a flattening , a falling off of that curve , " said Bonnie Henry , British Columbia ’s top medical officer . 
Speaking to reporters Friday , Henry said the extreme measures taken by the province in recent weeks—shutting down schools , non essential businesses — have shown promising results . 
" What we need , though , is for everybody to continue to pay attention to these measures so we can continue to prevent transmissions in our communities ... for the coming weeks . " 
The daily rate of growth of coronavirus cases in the province has been cut from 24 % to 12 % , far lower than that of China and Italy during their severe outbreaks . 
The updated figures comes amid a report from the province that suggests it is well equipped to handle a Hubei like breakout of infections . 
A level of spread similar to that of Italy ’s Lombardy region , however , would stress the system — but the province nonetheless believes it has sufficient ventilators . 
More than 4,600 cases have been reported in Canada , with 725 in British Columbia as of Thursday .
