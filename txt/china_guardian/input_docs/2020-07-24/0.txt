A 103 year old man has recovered from coronavirus in Pakistan to become one of the oldest survivors of the disease in the world , beating the odds in a country with a weak healthcare system , his relatives and doctors said . 
Aziz Abdul Alim , a resident of a village in the mountainous northern district of Chitral , was released last week from an emergency response centre after testing positive in early July . 
" We were worried for him given his age , but he was not worried at all , " Alim ’s son Sohail Ahmed told Reuters on the phone from his village , close to Pakistan ’s border with China and Afghanistan . 
Ahmed quoted his father as saying that he had been through a lot in life and the coronavirus did not scare him . 
He did however , not like being in isolation . 
A carpenter until his 70s , Alim has outlived three wives and nine sons and daughters , said Ahmed , who is himself in his 50s . 
Alim also had to be provided with moral and psychological support during his isolation and treatment , Dr Sardar Nawaz , a senior medical officer at the Aga Khan Health Service emergency centre told Reuters on Friday . 
The makeshift centre was set up in a girls ’ hostel just weeks before Alim was brought in and is the only one equipped to deal with Covid 19 patients for miles . 
Pakistan has registered more than 270,000 cases of the disease and 5,763 deaths . 
Though the number of people testing positive has dropped over the last month , government officials fear there could be another rise during the Muslim religious festival of Eid al Adha , which falls on 1 August .
