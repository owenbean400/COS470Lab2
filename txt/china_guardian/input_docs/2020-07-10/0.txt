The pandemic has led to the largest drop in heat trapping emissions in human history , according to a new study . 
Lockdowns , travel bans and closed manufacturing sites have caused global emissions to drop by 4.6 % , or 2.5 gigatonnes , according to a University of Sydney review of 38 regions and 26 sectors published in the journal Plos One . 
Fine particle pollution decreased by 3.8 % and two other types of air pollution declined by 2.9 % : sulphur dioxide – which is linked to a number of respiratory issues – and nitrogen oxide , which leads to smog . 
The largest emission drops occurred in the United States and China , largely due to grounded air travel and a decrease in power , water and gas use , but they came with a large economic cost . 
From late February to May , the study found that the pandemic caused 147 million people , or 4.2 % of the global workforce , to lose full time jobs and triggered a $ 3.8tn drop in consumption , making it the worst economic shock since the Great Depression , according to co author Arunima Malik .
