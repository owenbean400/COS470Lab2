The head of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and China â€™s president , Xi Jinping , have discussed ways to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the coronavirus and " possible alternatives " to evacuations , Reuters reports . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , who arrived in Beijing on Monday , will return to Geneva on Wednesday , WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva briefing . 
The WHO emergency committee is being " kept in the loop " on the evolution of the outbreak , which has spread to 13 other countries , he said . 
The WHO has not seen onward human to human spread of the virus by travellers returning from China apart from a second family member infected by a returning relative in Vietnam , which is " good news but of course this could change " , Lindmeier said .
