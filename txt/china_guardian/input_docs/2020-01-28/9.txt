President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday China was sure of defeating the " devil " coronavirus , in comments carried by Chinese state television . 
Xi spoke after he met the World Health Organization ( WHO ) chief , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , in Beijing to discuss how to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the virus and " possible " evacuation alternatives , a WHO spokesman said . 
State television quoted Xi as saying : The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide . 
China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention â€¦ China is confident of winning the battle against the virus . 
A WHO panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency . 
Traditionally , the WHO is reluctant to antagonise or ostracise countries dealing with epidemics for fear of undermining future willingness to report cases of infectious disease outbreaks .
