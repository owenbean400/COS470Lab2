The coronavirus outbreak could last several months and its course is unpredictable , with many thousands more people likely to have been affected than official figures suggest , according to Dr Jennifer Rohn , a specialist in cell biology at University College London . 
In an interview with the PA Media news agency , Rohn said it was possible the UK already has cases of coronavirus that have not been detected . 
" It is possible that somebody has slipped through the net , " she said . 
" The symptoms are incredibly common to lots of other things that are not harmful at all . " 
But she added : " I would not be surprised if we got a couple of cases soon . " 
According to Rohn , the virus was spreading more quickly than Sars but was less deadly . 
She said it was difficult to know how long the outbreak would last , adding : " It is hard to predict but , certainly , the cat is out of the bag . 
" We do not know the full picture – they are running very short on diagnostic kits in China – and the truth is we do not know where all the people are who are infected . " 
It was likely far more thousands of people are infected than the cases confirmed in China , she said . 
Dr Rohn said it was possible the virus could last several months but it could also end as the seasons change . 
" Some of these respiratory viruses are seasonal – there could be a peak and then there ’s a lull , " she said . 
" We may have some breathing space but to be honest we do not know yet . "
