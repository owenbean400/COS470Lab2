Brazil has reported a record increase in cases , with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24 hour period , taking the country ’s total to 78,162 . 
It has also suffered another 449 deaths in that time , raising its toll to at least 5,466 people since the outbreak began . 
Health specialists believe the real numbers are much higher . 
Brazil ’s far right president Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the rising death toll and , in recent weeks , has insisted the virus was " going away " . 
He shrugged off Tuesday ’s news that the official Brazilian total had surpassed the WHO reported death toll in China , saying : " So what ? 
I ’m sorry . 
What do you want me to do ? " 
Now , he has sought to blame state governors and mayors for the deaths – even though they have introduced social distancing measures against his orders while he repeatedly mingled with supporters and other Brazilians . 
He argued that they should be asked why they " took such restrictive measures and people kept dying " and told reporters : " You wo not put that bill on my lap . " 
Asked what responsibility he held for rising deaths , he replied : " The question is so idiotic I ’m not going to reply . "
