Greece might be high on the list of many people ’s summer holiday destinations , but for Britons dreaming of getting away the country will be out of reach for some time yet , writes Helena Smith , the Guardian ’s Athens correspondent . 
The UK was not included on a list of 29 countries released by Athens on Friday deemed to fit an " epidemiological profile " that makes travel from them relatively safe . 
However , people from European countries including Albania , Austria , Denmark , Germany , Finland , Norway Romania and Serbia – which like Greece have kept coronavirus infection rates and casualties low – will be allowed to fly in from 15 June . 
And further afield , residents of Australia , New Zealand , China , Japan , South Korea were also told they could visit . 
But the epidemiological profile " sadly " did not apply to Britain , said government officials , aware that the UK is one of Greece ’s biggest markets . 
Last year close to 4 million Britons travelled to Greece , with most heading to its extensive archipelago , which has remained remarkably Covid free .
