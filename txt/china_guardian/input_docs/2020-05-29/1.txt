Trump , who has been embroiled in a long running diplomatic clash with Beijing , has criticised the WHO for being too forgiving of China since the outbreak began . 
As he faces criticism of his handling of the epidemic in the US , he has sought to highlight China ’s status as the pandemic ’s origin . 
In mid April , Trump announced the US was freezing payments to the WHO for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the organisation ’s handling of the crisis .
