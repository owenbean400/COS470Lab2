Hi , I ’m Amy Walker , taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin . 
The Chinese gadget manufacturer , TCL communication , has become the latest company to make cutbacks to its planned presence at the upcoming Mobile World Congress ( MWC ) amid the coronavirus crisis . 
The company has said it would still have a booth on the tech show ’s floor , but would no longer hold a press conference . 
Sony and Amazon are among the other phone makers to have withdrawn from the event – which will be held in Barcelona later this month – in recent days , citing concerns about the spread of the virus . 
Ericsson , LG and Nvidia have also pulled out of the show . 
In a statement , TCL said : " Given the recent global health concerns due to the spread of the 2019 n Co V virus , and out of an abundance of caution and care for our staff , customers , press and other guests , TCL Communication is cancelling its global press event for MWC 2020 , which was planned for 22 February 2020 . 
" This decision does not impact any other MWC 2020 activities planned by the company and TCL will still announce its latest mobile devices and showcase them at its booth in the Fira Gran Via - Hall 3 , Stand 3D11 - from 24-27 February as scheduled . "
