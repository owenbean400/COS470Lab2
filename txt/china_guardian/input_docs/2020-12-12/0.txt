The share of Brazilians unwilling to take any Covid 19 vaccine grew to 22 % this week , from 9 % in August , and most said they would not accept one made in China , a new poll showed on Saturday , as president Jair Bolsonaro ’s comments stoked wider scepticism . 
The survey by pollster Datafolha found 73 % of respondents plan to take a shot and 5 % do not know if they will , compared with 89 % and 3 % , respectively , in August . 
Late last month , Bolsonaro said he would not take any coronavirus vaccine that becomes available . 
One of the world ’s most prominent coronavirus sceptics , Bolsonaro said refusal was his " right " and expressed concerns specifically about the vaccine developed by China ’s Sinovac and produced in conjunction with Sao Paulo state government ’s Butantan Institute , Reuters reports . 
According to Datafolha , only 47 % of participants would take a vaccine made in China , while 50 % said they would not take it and 3 % said they were undecided . 
The figures showed a correlation between vaccine rejection and trust in Bolsonaro . 
A total of 33 % of people who said they always trust Bolsonaro are unwilling to take a shot , against 16 % of those who say they would never trust the president .
