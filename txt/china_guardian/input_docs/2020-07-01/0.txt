The UN Security Council has finally backed the UN chief Antonio Guterres ’ 23 March call for a global truce amid the pandemic , adopting a resolution after months of talks to win a compromise between the United States and China , Reuters reports . 
The resolution , drafted by France and Tunisia , calls for " all parties to armed conflicts to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days " to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid . 
Negotiations were stymied by a standoff between China and the US over whether to urge support for the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
The latter country did not want a reference to the global health body , while the former did . 
The US president Donald Trump said in May that Washington would quit the Geneva based agency over its handling of the pandemic , accusing it of being " China centric " and promoting China ’s " disinformation " . 
The WHO denies the claims . 
The resolution does not mention the WHO explicitly , but does reference a UN General Assembly resolution that does . 
Richard Gowan , International Crisis Group UN director , said : We have really seen the body at its worst . 
This is a dysfunctional security council .
