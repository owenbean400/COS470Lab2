A survey released Saturday showed governments are fast losing support for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic , as health officials recorded a surge of more than 280,000 new cases globally two days in a row . 
Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro , widely criticised for his handling of the crisis , appeared to credit an unproven treatment for his recovery from the virus . 
And in the streets of Jerusalem and other cities , thousands called for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign , in part for his management of the coronavirus crisis . 
There were more than 280,000 new cases recorded globally on both Thursday and Friday , the highest daily rises since the virus emerged in China late last year , according to an AFP count based on official sources , an alarming uptick in the spread of the virus . 
Nearly a third of the world â€™s 15.8 million infections have been registered since 1 July , while the total death toll nears 640,000 . 
The World Health Organization said more than a million cases had been recorded in each of the last five weeks , " with over 280,000 being reported on July 24 alone " . 
" While no country is unaffected , this rise is driven by high transmission in large and populous countries in the Americas and South Asia , " it said in a statement on Saturday . 
Brazil and India had recently reported their highest daily increases , it added , while the figures remained worryingly high in the United States and South Africa - where Trade Minister Ebrahim Patel tested positive for the virus Saturday . 
The US , still the hardest hit nation , on Friday reported its second straight day of more than 70,000 new cases and over 1,000 deaths as the virus surges in the south and west .
