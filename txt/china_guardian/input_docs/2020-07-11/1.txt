Chinese vaccine developer Can Sino Biologics is in talks with Russia , Brazil , Chile and Saudi Arabia to launch a Phase III trial of its experimental Covid 19 vaccine , its co founder said on Saturday . 
China ’s success in driving down Covid 19 infections has made it harder to conduct large scale vaccine trials , and so far only a few countries have agreed to work with it , Reuters reports . 
" We are contacting Russia , Brazil , Chile and Saudi Arabia ( for the Phase III trial ) , and it ’s still in discussion , " Qiu Dongxu , executive director and co founder of Can Sino , told an anti viral drug development conference in Suzhou , in eastern China . 
He said its Phase III trial was likely to start " pretty soon , " and the company plans to recruit 40,000 participants for the test . 
Its Covid 19 candidate , Ad5 n Cov , became the first in China to move into human testing in March but is running behind other potential vaccines in terms of trial progress . 
Two experimental vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech and a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group ( Sinopharm ) are already approved for Phase III trials . 
Qiu said its Phase II trial involving 508 people has yielded " much better " results than the Phase I about the safety and ability to trigger immune response . 
He did not disclose specific evidence . 
He said its new factory under construction in China will allow it to produce 100-200 million doses of coronavirus vaccines per year by early 2021 .
