US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is taking the lead in pressing a hard line against Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic , AFP reports . 
Pompeo , in an interview Sunday on ABC , said there was " enormous evidence " that the new coronavirus came out of a Wuhan lab - not a wet market , as most scientists suggest . 
" Remember , China has a history of infecting the world and they have a history of running substandard laboratories , " he said . 
Pressed in the interview , Pompeo , formerly the CIA chief , walked back his statement that the SARS Co V 2 virus was " man made , " an idea explicitly rejected by US intelligence . 
Chinese state media on Monday responded with harsh commentary , denouncing his remarks as " insane " and saying , " Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies . " 
Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization , which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory .
