A senior Downing Street aide did not follow the spirit of the UK ’s lockdown rules when he made repeated trips away from his residence , the former prime minister Theresa May has said . 
Her successor , Boris Johnson , has refused to sack Dominic Cummings , despite anecdotal evidence lending weight to experts ’ concerns his transgressions are harming the country ’s public health efforts during an epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people in the country . 
Among various defences put forward by Johnson ’s allies was the claim that Cummings had not breached the government ordered lockdown in either its letter or spirit . 
Police have since concluded his actions might have breached the country ’s lockdown rules , tempering their language only for fear of police officers being considered to have declared him guilty without a trial . 
In a letter to her constituents seen by the Daily Mirror , May said she can " well understand the anger " of people who obeyed the guidance . 
What this matter has shown is that there was a discrepancy between the simple messages given by the government and the details of the legislation passed by parliament . 
In these circumstances , I do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance . 
I can well understand the anger of those who have been abiding by the spirit of the guidance given by the government and expect others to do so . 
May said the focus on Cummings was " detracting from the most important task " of dealing with the epidemic .
