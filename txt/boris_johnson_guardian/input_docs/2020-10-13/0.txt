Stormont has commenced a late night meeting amid mounting expectation Northern Ireland may be facing the prospect of a circuit break lockdown . 
The meeting got under way just after 9.30pm for talks on how to tackle spiralling Covid 19 infection rates in the region . 
Assembly members have been told to be on standby for a late night sitting of the legislature to be briefed on any measure that might be agreed by the Executive . 
Ministers are debating whether to trigger a circuit break lockdown , potentially for four weeks , that would see all pubs and restaurants closed . 
Schools could close for an extended period within that four weeks , potentially for a fortnight . 
It comes as , separately , Keir Starmer , the Labour leader , called on the UK government to " follow the science " and impose a national circuit breaker lockdown of at least two weeks in England as the death toll from Covid 19 soared to a four month high . 
It marked a significant escalation , with Starmer saying the prime minister Boris Johnson had " lost control of the virus " and must take urgent action to impose a near total shutdown across the country over the October half term . 
He suggested the shutdown , one week of which would coincide with schools ’ planned half term break , could also be used to upgrade the UK ’s beleaguered test and trace system . 
Starmer also suggested schools could remain open but non essential offices and all hospitality businesses would close , though he said they must be compensated by the Treasury .
