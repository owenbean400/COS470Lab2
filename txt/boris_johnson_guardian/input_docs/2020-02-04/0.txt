Emily Thornberry , the shadow foreign secretary , has sharply criticised the government ’s advice to British nationals in China that they should return to the UK . 
From the very start of this outbreak , the government ’s response has been a total shambles , and now they appear to be telling British nationals in China simply to fend for themselves in terms of getting out of the country . 
How on earth has the Foreign Office not got plans and protocols in place for how these crises are managed ? 
The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens , at home and abroad , and Boris Johnson is manifestly failing to do that .
