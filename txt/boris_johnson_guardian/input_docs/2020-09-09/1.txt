British prime minister Boris Johnson believes a mass testing programme is " our only hope for avoiding a second national lockdown before a vaccine " , according to leaked official documents setting out plans for " Operation Moonshot " . 
The prime minister is said to be pinning his hopes on a project that would deliver up to 10m tests a day – even though the current testing regime is struggling to deliver a fraction of that number and is beset by problems . 
The documents say the " Mass Population Testing Plan " could cost £ 100bn – the equivalent to the UK ’s entire education budget . 
If delivered , the moonshot programme would be unprecedented in scale and , as reflected by its name , is considered by some officials to be at the outer level of possibility . 
Some of the technology it would require does not yet exist . 
Details of the moonshot proposals emerged as Johnson on Wednesday urged people to abide by new restrictions that outlaw gatherings of more than six people indoors and out , and said they were imperative if the country was to avoid further toughening of the rules . 
In a gloomy assessment of the deteriorating position , England ’s chief medical officer , Prof Chris Whitty , said the recent rise in positive cases was a matter of huge concern . 
He also admitted the period " between now and spring is going to be difficult " and said the public should expect the new measures to be in place for a number of months – raising fears they may not be lifted before the new year .
