The UK prime minister will attempt to kickstart the economy after Covid 19 with a decade long schools rebuilding plan , PA Media reports . 
Boris Johnson is expected to announce the spending plans on Tuesday as he lays the groundwork for the UK to spend its way out of the coronavirus downturn by undertaking a vast building programme . 
Part of the plans will include a 10 year undertaking to improve school facilities , along with sprucing up classrooms currently in use . 
A £ 1bn cash injection will see construction work start on the first 50 projects as soon as September 2021 , Downing Street said . 
Another £ 560m will go towards school repairs in this financial year while further education colleges will see £ 200m of the £ 1.5bn promised by the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , at the spring budget to transform college estates over the next five years fast tracked so work can be brought forward . 
However , Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran called the announcement " spin over substance " , saying : " The funding is nowhere near the 7bn the National Audit Office has said is needed to repair our schools . " 
The Labour leader , Keir Starmer , said the PM would have to ensure the programme reversed a " lost decade " of low investment in many regions .
