The former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has described the level of testing being carried out in the country as " almost criminal " . 
The British government is carrying out significantly fewer than the 100,000 tests per day it promised to be doing by now . 
Nevertheless , the current prime minister Boris Johnson is now claiming he wants to increase capacity , if not actual testing , to a potential 200,000 per day . 
But Brown has told ITV ’s Peston programme that that number – even if it represented actual completed tests – would still be insufficient . 
You ’ve got to do more than 200,000 and you ’ve got to over time be able to say to the one and a half million health service workers , the one and a half million in the care sector , 1.7 million in construction , three million in retail , one million that have got contact with the public – police , fire – teachers and everything else , you ’ve got to be able to say to them : ‘ We can reassure you that you ’ll go back to work because we are going to offer you the testing that will find out whether you ’ve got it or whether other people you are working with have got it so we can actually isolate those people that have it ’ . 
Brown , who served as the most recent Labour prime minister from 2007 to 2010 , added : You take old people ’s homes ... why is it the case that every resident and every care worker is not being tested ? 
It seems to me almost criminal that you ’ve got to a stage where people are dying and where the only time that testing comes in apart from the random testing , is when people identify someone who ’s a carrier of the disease . 
You ’ve got to test before because people have no symptoms and they ’re passing on the disease . 
So you ’ve got to have prior testing , and every old people ’s home , every care worker , every health service worker , every person who ’s a frontline , making contact with the public , they ’ve got to be tested over the next few weeks .
