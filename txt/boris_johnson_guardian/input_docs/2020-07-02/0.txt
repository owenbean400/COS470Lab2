UK prime minister Boris Johnson will urge the public not to overdo it when pubs and restaurants reopen in a warning that the health of the economy " is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly " . 
He will lead a press conference ahead of the easing of the lockdown in England on Saturday . 
Johnson is expected to urge people to act safely or run the risk of the Government " putting on the brakes " and bringing back severe restrictions , as has been witnessed in Leicester . 
He is expected to paint the easing in England as a means of supporting the livelihoods of bosses and their employees but warn " we are not out of the woods yet " . 
" They are our local restaurants , hairdressers , libraries , museums , cinemas , and yes , pubs . 
They are also hotels , B&amp ; 
Bs , indeed much of our tourism industry , " he will say , according to an extract released to the media . 
" All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening , to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe . 
" But the success of these businesses , the livelihoods of those who rely on them , and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly . 
We must not let them down . 
" The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that . 
If it starts running out of control again the Government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re imposing restrictions . 
" Anyone who flouts social distancing and Covid secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal . " 
Asked if Mr Johnson would be visiting a pub or restaurant on Saturday , Johnson ’s spokesman said : " He ’s talked about his enthusiasm for a haircut and pint previously but I do not know exactly what he ’s doing on Saturday yet . "
