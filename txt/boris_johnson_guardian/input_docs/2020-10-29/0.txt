The UK prime minister , Boris Johnson , is under growing pressure to implement a pre - and post - Christmas lockdown to allow families to meet over the festive period , the Telegraph has reported . 
The article cites sources close to the government saying current restrictions do not go far enough , and tighter restrictions on the run up to Christmas would " get on top of the numbers " and allow people to meet in homes . 
A " circuit breaker " lockdown in January could then be used to reverse numbers and would be easier to implement than on the run up to Christmas , the newspaper reported .
