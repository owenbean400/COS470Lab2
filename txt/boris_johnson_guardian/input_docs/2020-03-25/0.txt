The UK government has asked the vacuum cleaner company , Dyson , to design and manufacture 10,000 ventilators to help deal with the outbreak in the coming weeks , according to an internal email seen by Reuters . 
The company â€™s founder , James Dyson , says in the email : We have received an initial order of 10,000 units from the UK Government which we will supply on an open book basis . 
We are also looking at ways of making it available internationally . 
Dyson said he received a call from the British prime minister Boris Johnson 10 days ago and has since refocused resources at Dyson to design and build an entirely new ventilator , The Co Vent . 
Reuters had reported earlier that British industry expected the government to give the go ahead for an emergency ventilator production plan on Wednesday .
