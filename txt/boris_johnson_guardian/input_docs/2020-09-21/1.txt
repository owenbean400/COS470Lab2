The London mayor , Sadiq Khan , said the package of measures he will ask the government to introduce includes some new restrictions . 
He said they include having everyone wearing facemasks and not just on public transport but in public spaces and in hospitality venues for all staff " where possible " . 
On the prospect of a curfew for restaurants and bars , he told Sky News : The time does not matter . 
There is nothing magic about 10pm or 11pm . 
The issue is the amount of hours people are spending together where they could be asymptomatic and the virus passes on . 
Khan called on prime minister Boris Johnson to invite him to attend Tuesday â€™s Cobra meeting to help with the next steps to tackle the pandemic . 
Khan said he is " really concerned " about a range of economic factors affecting London , including levels of footfall and transport . 
Khan told the programme : The health crisis is leading to an economic crisis , which has led to a mental health crisis . 
The way to avoid the virus spreading even faster is to take ( on ) these additional measures .
