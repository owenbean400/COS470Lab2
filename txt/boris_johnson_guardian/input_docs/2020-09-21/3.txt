Pubs , bars and restaurants in England will have to shut by 10pm from Thursday under new nationwide restrictions to halt an " exponential " rise in coronavirus cases . 
Police have also been handed powers to issue £ 1,000 fines and make arrests to enforce 2 metre social distancing in pubs and restaurants , the Guardian has learned . 
Boris Johnson is expected to make an address to the nation on Tuesday setting out the new measures . 
With cases doubling every week across the UK and a second wave expected to last up to six months , health officials had advised the government over the weekend to " move hard and fast " , according to a source . 
Meanwhile , the Treasury was concerned that many businesses had " no buffer " to withstand a significant new economic hit . 
The UK ’s Covid 19 alert level was raised to four on Monday , meaning the virus is " high or rising exponentially " – a move which gave Johnson cover for renewed action .
