The British government is working to ensure all schools can open in September and to provide support packages to help children catch up on lost learning , the office of prime minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday . 
Schools shut to most pupils in March due to the coronavirus pandemic but selected age groups have been able to return since the beginning of June , although some educators decided not to re open because they said it was not safe . 
The decision to gradually re open schools has divided opinion , with Britain suffering one of the world â€™s worst death tolls from Covid 19 and some critics warning of the need for caution to prevent a second wave of the virus . 
Johnson has asked for measures to be drawn up to help children over the summer and further into the future , said the statement . 
For social justice reasons help was especially needed for those who had less support at home , it added .
