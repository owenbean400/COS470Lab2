Queen Elizabeth II , who has spent much of the coronavirus outbreak in self isolation because of her age , will forego her traditional family Christmas , the royal household said . 
The 94 year old monarch and her husband Prince Philip normally spend the festive season at her Sandringham estate in eastern England with other members of the family . 
" Having considered all the appropriate advice , the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have decided that this year they will spend Christmas quietly in Windsor , " the royal household said , referring to a castle west of London . 
The Queen postponed public engagements and moved from her official residence in the British capital to Windsor on 19 March as the coronavirus outbreak took hold . 
Britain has seen more than 59,000 deaths from nearly 1.6m cases . 
Prince Philip , who turned 99 on 10 June , has been in poor health in recent years and spent four nights in hospital last December for an unspecified pre existing condition . 
Their eldest son Prince Charles and his son Prince William have both isolated after showing mild Covid symptoms . 
The Queen made a rare televised address to the nation in early April calling on Britons to summon the " Blitz spirit " of the second world war to get through the months long lockdown . 
Her weekly meeting with the prime minister , Boris Johnson , has been conducted by telephone . 
She was seen at a scaled back , socially distanced Trooping the Colour parade in the grounds of Windsor on 13 June – the first time it has been staged at the castle since 1895 . 
Also at Windsor in July , she knighted Captain Tom Moore , a 100 year old second world war veteran who raised millions of pounds for health charities in a sponsored walk of his garden . 
Her first public appearance outside one of her homes – where she has a reduced household staff known as HMS Bubble – was on 16 October , when she visited the Porton Down research laboratory with grandson William .
