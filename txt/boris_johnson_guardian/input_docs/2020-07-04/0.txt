The prime minister ’s father , Stanley Johnson , has defended his decision to travel to Greece during the coronavirus pandemic . 
Stanley Johnson posted a picture on social media of himself arriving in the country wearing a mask , and said he was visiting on " essential business " because he needed to " Covid proof my property " before the letting season . 
He was widely criticised for travelling via Bulgaria to avoid travel bans on direct flights from the UK . 
Asked about social media posts , Johnson senior told reporters on Saturday : " I did not put them up ... in a spirit of defiance or anything like that . " 
Asked if he had put his son , the prime minister , in a difficult position by travelling to Greece , Johnson senior said : " I have read his answers and he is absolutely right to say ... that , you know what ... and I think ... 
I am not going to talk about private conversations between family members ... and , I am absolutely not going to talk about that . " 
Referring to airbridges between the UK and other countries , the PM ’s father said : " Let ’s open this airbridge as quick as we can . 
People are longing to get here and this is a country which has everything . " 
He added : " I am not going to say whether my actions were correct or not but in any case what happened , happened . 
How wonderful it would be if , quite quickly , if the two governments could come to some arrangement . " 
Boris Johnson has refused to condemn his father for flying to Greece in apparent breach of Foreign Office guidance to avoid non essential travel . 
" I think you really ought to raise that with him . 
I am not going to get into details of family conversations , " he said on LBC .
