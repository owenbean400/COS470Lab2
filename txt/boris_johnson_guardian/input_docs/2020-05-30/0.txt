The more than 2 million people who have been " shielding " from Covid 19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors from Monday for the first time in 10 weeks , Reuters reports . 
The government said on Saturday that the 2.2 million will be able to go outside with members of their household , while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines . 
Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household . 
" I do not underestimate just how difficult it has been for you , staying at home for the last 10 weeks , and I want to pay tribute to your resilience , " prime minister Boris Johnson said in a statement . 
Those shielding remain at risk however and the government said they should only leave the house once a day , not go to work or the shops and should avoid crowded places where they cannot social distance . 
Support provided to those with serious medical complications , such as the delivery of food , medicines and phone calls , will continue .
