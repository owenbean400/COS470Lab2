British prime minister Boris Johnson said reopening schools in September was a social , economic and moral imperative and insisted schools would be able to operate safely despite the coronavirus pandemic . 
His comments follow a study earlier this month which warned that Britain risks a second wave of Covid 19 in the winter twice as large as the initial outbreak if schools open without an improved test and trace system . 
Writing in the Mail on Sunday , Johnson said restarting schools was a national priority . 
Schools would be the last places to close in future local lockdowns , he was quoted by another newspaper as telling a meeting on Thursday . 
Schools in England closed in March during a national lockdown , except for the children of key workers , and reopened in June for a small number of pupils . 
" Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable , economically unsustainable and morally indefensible , " Johnson wrote . 
The economic costs for parents who cannot work if schools are shut are spiralling , and the country faces big problems if children miss out on education , the prime minister warned . 
" This pandemic is not over , and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent . 
But now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely , we have a moral duty to do so , " Johnson wrote . 
The headteachers ’ union has criticised Johnson ’s push and warned that schools will teach pupils on a " week on week off " basis if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus , and are drawing up a number of contingency plans , according to the Telegraph . 
The Sunday Times newspaper reported that Johnson has ordered a public relations campaign to ensure schools open on time .
