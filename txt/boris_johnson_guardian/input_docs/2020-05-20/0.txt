In the UK , overseas health and care workers on the coronavirus frontline have reacted with fury after Boris Johnson refused to exempt them from the NHS surcharge , insisting that it was " the right way forward " . 
In interviews with the Guardian ’s Sarah Marsh and Harriet Grant , migrant health workers – who face an NHS bill of as much as £ 2,500 a year for a family of four – spoke out over a relentless working environment , struggles to pay their rent , and a heavy toll on their family life . 
" We feel insulted , " one said . 
" We are putting our lives and our family ’s lives at risk . " 
The prime minister resisted pressure from Labour ’s Keir Starmer to amend the policy , telling MPs that he " accepts and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff " but added : " We must look at the realities … those contributions help us to raise about £ 900m . " 
Later , the IFS estimated that the contribution from overseas NHS staff amounted to around £ 90m .
