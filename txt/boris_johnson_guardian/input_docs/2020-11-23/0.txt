The British prime minister Boris Johnson said he hoped almost all Britons at high risk from Covid 19 would be vaccinated against the disease by Easter . 
" We should be able to inoculate , I believe on the evidence I ’m seeing , the vast majority of the people who need the most protection by Easter , " Johnson told a news conference . 
He also said people will not be forced to have vaccinations against Covid 19 . 
There will be no compulsory vaccination . 
That ’s not the way we do things in this country . 
We think it ( vaccination ) is a good idea , and you know I totally reject the propaganda of the anti vaxxers , they are wrong . 
Everybody should get a vaccine as soon as it is available .
