UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said Black Lives Matter demonstrations have been subverted by " thuggery " , and those responsible will be held to account . 
People have a right to protest peacefully & amp ; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police . 
These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve . 
Those responsible will be held to account . 
This comes as tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday , after a week in which growing numbers defied calls from politicians and police to avoid mass gatherings to rally against racial injustice .
