When UK prime minister Boris Johnson sought to explain during his address to the nation on Tuesday why some people had failed to follow the coronavirus rules , he had a surprising explanation : they ’re just too British . 
" We have kept that virus at bay . 
But we have to acknowledge this is a great and freedom loving country , and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected . " 
The message prompted some obvious questions : just how fervent is Britain about freedom , and how has that affected the country ’s response to the coronavirus ?
