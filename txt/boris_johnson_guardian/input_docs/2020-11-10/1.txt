Boris Johnson will face sustained pressure from within his own party not to extend England ’s national lockdown next month after senior Tory backbenchers formed a group to resist any such move , PA reports . 
Some 32 Conservatives rebelled against the government when the Commons approved the second lockdown for England which lasts until 2 December . 
The prime minister said he expects the nation to return to a tiered local system by then and promised MPs a vote for the replacement to the four week lockdown . 
Former chief whip Mark Harper and ex Brexit minister Steve Baker will lead the " Covid recovery group " to resist any extension of the measure in the Commons vote . 
Harper said : The cure we ’re prescribing runs the risk of being worse than the disease . 
The group outlined three guiding principles calling on ministers to undertake a cost benefit analysis of restrictions , to end the " monopoly " of advice from UK government scientists and to improve measures to tackle Covid 19 such as test and trace . 
Baker said : We must find a more sustainable way of leading our lives until a vaccine is rolled out , rather than throwing our prosperity away by shutting down and destroying our economy , and overlooking the untold health consequences caused by lockdowns and restrictions . 
Sir Graham Brady , the influential chair of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs , is among those said to have joined the group , along with the likes of William Wragg and Sir Robert Syms .
