Back in the UK , the Metropolitan police have released footage of officers clearing sunbathers from Shepherd ’s Bush Green , in west London , on the first day of the UK wide coronavirus lockdown . 
" Can you all go home please , " one officer can be heard saying . 
" It ’s not a holiday , it ’s a lockdown . " 
Under tough new measures announced by the prime minister Boris Johnson , people are allowed to leave their homes only to exercise once a day , to travel to and from " absolutely necessary " work , and to shop for essential items .
