The British prime minister , Boris Johnson , called for the UK population to come together for " collective health " in a televised address in which he announced " perhaps six months " of new restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus . 
Johnson said the country must " reserve the right to go further " with coronavirus restrictions . 
He does not want to impose a second total lockdown , but said there have been " too many breaches " of the rules .
