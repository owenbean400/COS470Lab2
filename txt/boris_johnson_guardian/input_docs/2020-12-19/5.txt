Swiss authorities have approved the use of the Pfizer Bio NTech Covid 19 vaccine with immunisation to start just after Christmas , AFP has said . 
Switzerland has been recording more than 4,000 new cases and 100 deaths every day . 
Six thousand people have died in the country since the pandemic began . 
The Swissmedic regulatory authority said : After a meticulous review of the available information , Swissmedic concluded that the Covid 19 vaccine from Pfizer Bio NTech is safe and that its benefit outweighs the risks . 
Priority will be given to the elderly and those with pre existing conditions , a cohort that makes up just under a quarter of Switzerland â€™s population of 8.6m . 
The announcement came a day after the Swiss government said bars and restaurants would once again be closed across the country from Tuesday for at least a month . 
The number of infections is very high and is continuing to rise . 
Hospitals and healthcare workers have been under extreme pressure for weeks and the festive period increases the risk of an even more rapid rise in cases .
