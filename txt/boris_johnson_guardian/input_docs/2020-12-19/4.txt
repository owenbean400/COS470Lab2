Hello , it ’s Calla Wahlquist from the Guardian Australia team . 
Thank you to Nicola Slawson for taking us through the past few hours . 
In Australia , we are standing by for NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian to stand up at 11am , just over an hour away , and give an update on the Sydney outbreak . 
The police commissioner is also attending the press conference — usually a sign that restrictions are being announced .
