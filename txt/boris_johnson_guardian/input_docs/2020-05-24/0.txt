The Daily Mail - usually one of Boris Johnson ’s supporters in the press - has called on the prime minister to sack Dominic Cummings , trailing its headline with the following : In the clearest way , Dominic Cummings has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown . 
Boris Johnson says he ‘ totally gets ’ how the public feels about this . 
Clearly he totally does not . 
Neither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust . 
Do they think we are fools ? 
For the good of the government and the nation , Mr Cummings must resign . 
Or the prime minister must sack him . 
No ifs . 
No buts .
