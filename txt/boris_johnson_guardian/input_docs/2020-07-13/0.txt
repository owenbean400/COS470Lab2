Face masks will become mandatory in shops across England , UK government ministers are to announce on Tuesday , following mixed messages , a cabinet split and mounting pressure on the country ’s prime minister Boris Johnson to change public advice , Jessica Elgot , Heather Stewart and Vikram Dodd write . 
New legislation will not come into force until Friday 24 July , however , raising concerns over the risk of coronavirus spreading over the next 10 days as lockdown is eased . 
Enforcement , which will include a fine of up to £ 100 for non compliance , will be down to police , though shop staff will be expected to encourage the policy , No 10 said . 
The announcement is understood to have been rushed forward after Michael Gove , the cabinet minister , said on Sunday that masks should not be made mandatory , contradicting indications from the prime minister last week .
