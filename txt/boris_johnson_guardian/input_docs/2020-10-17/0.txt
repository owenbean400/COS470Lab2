Anti lockdown demonstrators gathered in central London on Saturday , hours after the British capital moved to the second highest Covid 19 alert level . 
As a second wave of infections gathers pace , prime minister Boris Johnson ’s government has stepped up local restrictions in parts of England where cases are surging – hoping to shield the economy by allowing the least affected regions to remain open . 
As of midnight , London was moved to the " tier 2 " or " high risk " level . 
This bans people from meeting anybody outside their household or " support bubble " – including friends or relatives who help to care for children – in any indoor setting . 
The rules also forbid more than six people to meet outdoors , though the police chose not to enforce them as several thousand anti lockdown campaigners marched down Oxford Street , usually one of the world ’s busiest shopping streets . 
The protesters view Covid 19 restrictions as unnecessary and a breach of their human rights . 
Some oppose mask wearing and vaccinations . 
Some carried placards saying : " MY BODY MY CHOICE , NO TO MANDATORY MASKS . " 
" There ’s plenty of things that can kill you , you know , it could happen any day , " protester Aragorn Kyley , 17 , told Reuters . 
" It ’s about living , not just surviving . 
We want to be able to enjoy our lives , not just be stuck at home . " 
As of Saturday , 57 % of the UK ’s population was living under tighter coronavirus restrictions . 
However , scientists from the Sage group that advises the government , and the main opposition Labour party , want ministers to go further and impose a short nationwide lockdown or so called " circuit breaker " to halt the spread of the disease .
