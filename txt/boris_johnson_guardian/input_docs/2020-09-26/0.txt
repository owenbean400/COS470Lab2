Queen Elizabeth II will recognise the work of hundreds of doctors , nurses , fundraisers and volunteers during the pandemic when the her annual birthday honours list is published next month . 
The list , which was due to be published in June , was postponed in order to add nominations for people playing key roles in the early months of the outbreak . 
It will be released on 10 October . 
The UK has recorded the worst death toll in Europe and one of the worst economic contractions of any leading nation since the pandemic took hold in March . 
The Queen has made very few public appearances during that time but she has delivered a number of rallying messages to the nation and appeared in video conference calls with care workers and members of the military . 
In July , she knighted Captain Tom Moore , recognising the 100 year old ’s efforts in lifting the nation ’s spirits during the pandemic by raising over £ 39 million for health workers by walking laps of his garden with the aid of a walking frame . 
The prime minister Boris Johnson said the pandemic was the greatest health challenge in our lifetime . 
We all have to play our part , but the dedication , courage and compassion seen from these recipients , be it responding on the frontline or out in their communities providing support to the most vulnerable , is an inspiration to us all . 
We owe them a debt of gratitude and the 2020 Queen ’s Birthday honours will be the first of many occasions where we can thank them as a nation .
