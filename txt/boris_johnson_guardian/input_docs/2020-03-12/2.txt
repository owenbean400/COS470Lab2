Hospital bosses are delighted with Boris Johnson ’s continued insistence that school closures would not help combat coronavirus . 
" This decision will obviously be welcomed by the NHS and those leading organisations at the frontline of caring for patients with the coronavirus " , said a senior leader in the NHS . 
" We are in a very fast moving and unprecedented situation and trust leaders are working hard to ensure that they have the plans , resources and capacity to respond to the inevitable increase in cases and key to that is having enough staff in place . 
This is one less issue to have to manage at this stage , but they are clearly planning ahead and looking at how they can continue to provide patient care if the situation does change . " 
Two hours before Johnson ’s press conference Richard Beeken , chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust , tweeted his view -- which is widely shared in the NHS : I sincerely hope not because if they do , NHS and social care staffing availability plummets as no one available to look after the children . 
We must all await the national decision on this . 
One senior hospital executive told me recently that trusts are acutely concerned about school closures because that could produce a very difficult " double whammy " of large numbers of staff off to look after their children at the same time as hospitals are suddenly being hit by a really significant surge in patients left seriously ill by Covid 19 .
