Boris Johnson â€™s government was not the only one to get a hammering today from a senior health official for its handling of the virus outbreak . 
Dr Anthony Fauci , a top federal health official , has said that the U.S lag in coronavirus testing is a failing , and claimed improvements are needed . 
Experts say the U.S simply is not testing enough people . 
" The system is not really geared to what we need right now " , said Fauci . 
" That is a failing . 
It is a failing , lets admit it . " 
Large scale testing is a critical part of tracking the spread of infectious diseases and allocating resources for treatment . 
The lack of comprehensive figures means U.S . health providers could quickly be overwhelmed by undetected cases . 
As of this afternoon , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was reporting about 1,260 U.S . illnesses , a number that trailed independent researchers , who are adding reports from individual states more quickly . 
Researchers at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles this week estimated that the true count of infections was close to 9,000 about two weeks ago .
