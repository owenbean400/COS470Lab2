British prime minister Boris Johnson has said outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from 1 June as long as proper measures are put in place . 
He says the open nature of such places means they represent a lower risk than indoor places . 
At his daily briefing , Johnson also said that a further wave of reopening could start on 15 June , adding that indoor shops such as department stores would be allowed to open for business from that date as long as proper measures are put in place . 
It was also announced by Prof Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England that the current R rate is around 0.7 .
