About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh ’s vast camps , officials said Monday , as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29 . 
Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements , housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar , and officials had restricted movement to the area in April . 
On Monday , Bangladesh recorded a fresh high in coronavirus detections , with 1,975 more people reported as testing positive in the past 24 hours , bringing the cumulative total to 35,585 . 
Of those who have tested positive , so far 7,334 have recovered and 501 have died , with 21 deaths reported in the past 24 hours , according to the country ’s epidemiology institute . 
The first cases in the Rohingya camps were detected in mid May . " None of the infections are critical , " Toha Bhuiyan , a senior health official in the surrounding Cox ’s Bazar area told AFP . 
" Most hardly show any symptoms . 
Still we have brought them in isolation centres and quarantined their families . " 
Mahbubur Rahman , the chief health official of Cox ’s Bazar , said authorities hoped this week they would double the number of tests being performed daily from 188 . 
He said further entry restrictions have been imposed on the camp , with a 14 day quarantine in place for anyone visiting from Dhaka . 
" We are very worried because the Rohingya camps are very densely populated . 
We suspect community transmission ( of the virus ) has already begun , " Rahman told AFP .
