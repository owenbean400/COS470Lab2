Boris Johnson will announce on Sunday that all travellers coming to the UK will be quarantined for a fortnight , according to the Times newspaper . 
" Passengers arriving at airports and ports including Britons returning from abroad will have to self isolate for 14 days , " the paper said , citing a government source . 
Travellers from Ireland , the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will be exempt , as will lorry drivers bringing crucial supplies . 
The measures are believed to be coming into force in early June . 
Authorities will carry out spot checks and hand out to fines of up to Â£ 1,000 , or possibly deportation , for those found to be breaking the rules , the report said . 
It added that travellers will have to provide the UK address at which they intend to self isolate .
