Andy Burnham , the mayor of Greater Manchester in England , accused the government of playing a " game of poker with people ’s lives " after Boris Johnson imposed the toughest Covid restrictions on the region without agreeing a support package for businesses and low paid workers . 
After a chaotic day of negotiations , the 10 day standoff between Downing Street and Greater Manchester ’s leaders came to an acrimonious end despite the two sides being just £ 5m apart , or the equivalent of £ 1.78 for each resident . 
In a televised statement , Burnham warned that local people faced " a winter of real hardship " . 
He accused ministers of bullying the region into accepting less than their £ 65m final request for support for businesses and said that walking away from the talks amounted to a " deliberate act of levelling down " . 
The prime minister confirmed that tier 3 measures would be imposed on 2.8 million people in the region from midnight on Thursday , closing pubs and a swathe of the hospitality sector . 
It means one in 10 people in England – nearly 6 million – will be under the strictest measures . 
These are the first curbs to be imposed unilaterally , however .
