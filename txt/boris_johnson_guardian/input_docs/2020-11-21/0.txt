Conservative rebels are preparing to resist Boris Johnson ’s plans for restrictions to replace the national lockdown without extensive evidence they will save more lives than they cost . 
The Covid Recovery Group ( CRG ) , led by former chief whip Mark Harper and ex Brexit minister Steve Baker , is threatening to withhold support for the prime minister ’s measures when the four week lockdown in England ends on 2 December . 
In a letter , understood to have been signed by 70 Tory MPs , the CRG said that " even the tiered system of restrictions infringes deeply upon people ’s lives with huge health and economic costs " . 
The closure of non essential retail , outside sport restrictions and care home visits were among the specific concerns raised . 
It comes as a new poll reveals most of the public would prefer to have a locked down Christmas than have another lockdown imposed in January .
