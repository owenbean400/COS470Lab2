In the UK , a trade body has said that an expected 14 day quarantine period for all travellers coming to the country would have a devastating impact on the aviation industry and wider economy . 
It is anticipated that Boris Johnson will announce the quarantine tomorrow as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic . 
It will affect people arriving at airports , ports and Eurostar railway stations , including Britons returning from abroad . 
Under the plan , set to be in place by the end of early June , arrivals will be asked to provide the address at which they will self isolate for two weeks by filling out a digital form . 
But Karen Dee , the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association , said it would " not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry , but also on the wider economy " . 
However , some have questioned why the quarantine measure was not introduced sooner , and what the scientific reasoning is for it to be introduced at this point in the government â€™s response . 
Other countries including Australia and New Zealand ordered 14 day isolation periods for visitors as early as March .
