Boris Johnson has written to Conservative MPs offering them a second vote on the coronavirus tier system early next year , as he seeks to quell a backbench rebellion in the Commons on Tuesday . 
In a letter to colleagues on Saturday evening , the prime minister said stringent regulations planned across much of England from 2 December would contain an expiry date of 3 February , with MPs offered the chance to vote to extend them . 
In a further olive branch to MPs , Johnson said he would publish more data and outline what circumstances need to change for an area to move down a tier .
