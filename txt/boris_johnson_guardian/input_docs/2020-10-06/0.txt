Hours after the UK prime minister Boris Johnson ’s speech at the Conservative party conference , twelve of his MPs voted against approving the " rule of six " regulation , which limits social gatherings . 
Rebels included the chair and vice chair of the backbench 1922 committee Graham Brady and Charles Walker , select committee chair Huw Merriman and the former cabinet minister Esther Mc Vey . 
Johnson is likely to face more opposition when MPs are due to approve the 10pm curfew , which both Tory MPs and the Labour frontbench have called on the government to publish further evidence for its effectiveness . 
Tory former minister Steve Baker said people were being " destroyed by this lockdown , strong , confident people , outgoing people , gregarious people … reduced to repeated episodes of tears on the phone " .
