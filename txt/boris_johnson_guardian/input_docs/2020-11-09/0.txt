The UK prime minister , Boris Johnson , has issued a cautious welcome to Pfizer/Bio NTech ’s announcement on its vaccine candidate , which it said had proved 90 % effective in interim results . 
He said the world had " cleared one significant hurdle " but there remain several more to jump before the vaccine is approved . 
Mixing his metaphors , he compared the announcement to a " distant bugle " of a cavalry coming to the rescue – but he warned that " these are very , very early days " yet . 
He added : We absolutely cannot rely on this news as a solution and the biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment .
