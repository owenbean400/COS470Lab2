The UK ’s former justice secretary , David Gauke , has said his thoughts are with Boris Johnson , his fiancée Carrie Symonds and Johnson ’s family . 
I wish him well in the personal battle he faces . 
I know him reasonably well . 
He ’s someone who , even when you disagree with him , he ’s a very charming , likeable figure as the public well knows . 
We need him back , on a personal level and for the good of the country . 
Gauke told the BBC that Dominic Raab , who is standing in for Johnson , will have an experienced and supportive team around him . 
He knows what he wants to do and gets on and delivers that . 
He ’ll be absolutely on top of the detail .
