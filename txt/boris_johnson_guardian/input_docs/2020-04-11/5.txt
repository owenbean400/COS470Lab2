A British critical care nurse has warned that frontline health staff are " dehydrated " because they are skipping drinks in order not to waste personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . 
The nurse , who asked to remain anonymous , said staff felt they were being " lied to " about masks , and the situation was being handled " horrendously " . 
The health worker , from the North of England , hit back at suggestions staff were wasting equipment and said those working on her ward were afraid to take off their masks to drink , as this means they have to be thrown away , raising the risk of dehydration . 
She told the PA news agency : " We are being lied to about what masks we do and do not have , and they ’re hiding ones we are running out of . " 
She said : " We ca not eat or drink enough because we ca not have water or snacks in the area and ca not take masks off . 
" And we ’re too scared to drink too much when we ’re out because if we need to go to the toilet then it means taking it all off again and wasting it , so we are all horribly dehydrated . " 
The Government is facing a backlash after Health Secretary Matt Hancock called PPE a " precious resource " and said it was important that healthcare workers use the " right amount " .
