Brazil ’s deficit is fast approaching 500 billion reais ( $ 96 billion ) , 7 % of gross domestic product , compared to 61 billion reais , or 0.9 % of GDP last year . 
This figure does not include the state aid proposal of up to 222 billion reais to tackle coronavirus , the economy ministry said on Saturday . 
" It is important that any new fiscal impact be discussed carefully to avoid an excessive growth of the primary deficit and public debt of the public sector beyond what is strictly necessary to reduce the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus crisis , " the ministry said in a statement . 
Brazil ’s President Jair Bolsonaro has balked at social distancing measures imposed by state governors and even his own health officials . 
He wants to see the economy re started , arguing that extended shutdowns pose a greater risk than a disease he calls a " little cold . "
