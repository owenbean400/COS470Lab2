The chair of the Parliamentary group on immigration detention in the UK has called for all detainees to be temporarily released after a rise in Covid 19 cases in removal centres . 
Alison Thewliss , MP for Glasgow Central and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group ( APPG ) on immigration detention , asked the Home Secretary to immediately release all detainees due to the ongoing pandemic . 
It comes after a case of Covid 19 was confirmed at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre ( IRC ) close to Gatwick airport on April 7 , Ms Thewliss said in a letter . 
This was the second case brought to the attention of the APPG following the first confirmed case at Yarl â€™s Wood IRC on March 22 . 
However , a High Court case brought by charity Detention Action last month heard there may be at least two further cases . 
SNP MP Ms Thewliss called the newest case " entirely avoidable " and expressed her concern , particularly for detainees with pre existing conditions . 
In a letter to the Home Secretary , Ms Thewliss wrote : " The confirmation of a new coronavirus case at Brook House demonstrates the danger detainees are continuing to be put in . 
" Now more than ever , protection must be prioritised over immigration targets . 
IRCs are high risk for clusters of Covid 19 with staff providing a conduit for infection to and from the community . " 
" The continued spread of the virus clearly highlights the very real risk of uncontrolled outbreaks at IRCs . "
