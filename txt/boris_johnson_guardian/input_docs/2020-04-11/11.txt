JPMorgan Chase & amp ; 
Co , one of the US ’ largest mortgage lenders , is raising borrowing standards this week for most new home loans , as it tries to mitigate lending risk caused by coronavirus . 
From Tuesday , customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700 , and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20 % of the home ’s value . 
" Due to the economic uncertainty , we are making temporary changes that will allow us to more closely focus on serving our existing customers , " Amy Bonitatibus , chief marketing officer for JPMorgan Chase ’s home lending business , told Reuters . 
The changes will enable JPMorgan to reduce its exposure to borrowers who unexpectedly lose their job , suffer a decline in wages , or whose homes lose value . 
The bank said the change will also free up staff to handle a surge in mortgage refinance requests , which are taking longer to process due to staff working from home and non essential businesses being closed .
