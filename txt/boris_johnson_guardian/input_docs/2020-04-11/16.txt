Saudi Arabia has extended its curfew " until further notice " , the state new agency said early on Sunday morning . 
King Salman has previously ordered a curfew that took effect on 23 March , from 7pm to 6 am for 21 days , to curb the spread of the coronavirus . 
Last week Saudi Arabia placed its capital Riyadh and other big cities under a 24 hour curfew , locking down much of the population to stem the spread of the new coronavirus . 
A decision is expected soon on whether the annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca will be cancelled .
