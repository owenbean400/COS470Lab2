Pope Francis urged people to " not yield to fear " and focused on a " message of hope " as he led an Easter eve mass in an empty St Peter â€™s Basilica tonight , reported Reuters , amid the coronavirus pandemic . 
The vigil , which normally takes place in a church packed with about 10,000 people , was attended by only about two dozen , including a few altar servers and a smaller than usual choir . 
Because of the coronavirus outbreak , it was scaled back to eliminate several traditional features , such as the baptism of adult converts and a long procession up the main aisle of the church .
