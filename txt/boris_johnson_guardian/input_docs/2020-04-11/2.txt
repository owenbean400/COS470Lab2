Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s election rival Benny Gantz has asked for additional time to try to form a government with the long time leader , to end more than a year of political deadlock . 
A 28 day mandate to put together a governing coalition , following an inconclusive March 2 election , expires on April 14 . 
Gantz , an ex armed forces chief who heads the centrist Blue and White party , asked President Reuven Rivlin for a 14 day extension to the mandate . 
Gantz had run on a promise not to serve in a government with Netanyahu , citing the prime minister ’s indictment on corruption charges . 
Netanyahu denies those charges . 
But in a reversal that dismayed many of his supporters , Gantz said the coronavirus crisis had made a national emergency government with Netanyahu ’s right wing Likud party an imperative . 
" The political , health and social crisis have brought me to the decision that even at a heavy political and personal price , I will do all I can to establish a government with the Likud , " Gantz wrote in a letter to the president , published by his party . 
Rivlin gave no immediate word on whether he would grant more time to Gantz , who in his letter said the two political rivals appeared close to a final agreement .
