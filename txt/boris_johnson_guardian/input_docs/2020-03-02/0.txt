The BBC ’s Laura Kuenssberg has written an analysis about the government ’s scramble to respond convincingly to the challenges the coronavirus outbreaks poses . 
She writes : Behind closed doors in government there is a realisation that an outbreak of coronavirus could go on for many months and cause a lot of disruption to many people ’s lives . 
Many of us might be asked to work at home . 
There are questions too about how self employed people or those on zero hours contracts can make a living . 
What happens to the local elections in May ? Can the NHS , already under a lot of pressure , really cope ? 
[...] Boris Johnson ’s government is certainly no longer in the position of surveying the new political landscape and wondering which of its priorities it can choose to deal with first . 
Instead , it faces an immediate and highly complicated question it needs to answer . 
Get it wrong and there could be serious political damage too .
