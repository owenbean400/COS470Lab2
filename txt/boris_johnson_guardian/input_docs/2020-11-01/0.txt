A ban on care home visits in England â€™s winter lockdown would violate the " fundamental human rights " of residents and their families , the National Care Forum ( NCF ) has warned health secretary Matt Hancock in a letter . 
In a letter signed by 60 organisations , NCF leaders have urged the health secretary , along with social care secretary Helen Whately , to allow limited numbers of relatives to visit care homes . 
Government guidelines currently tell care homes to " follow existing guidance " with more to come ahead of the lockdown , which will be introduced from Thursday . 
Speaking at a press conference in October , Boris Johnson acknowledged the situation is " absolutely wretched " for people unable to see loved ones in care homes , adding he was " certainly looking at what we can do to ... allow people to visit their elderly relatives in extreme circumstances " . 
Vic Rayner , executive director of the NCF , said said : " We must balance the risk of harm from Covid 19 with the risk of harm from isolation and physical , mental , and emotional deterioration ( for residents ) . "
