The UK prime minister ’s chief political adviser , Dominic Cummings , and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic , according to a list leaked to the Guardian . 
It reveals both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( Sage ) on 23 March , the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address . 
Multiple attendees of Sage told the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February . 
The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice . 
There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group , which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies . 
Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid 19 outbreak is being kept secret . 
The government ’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was " shocked " to discover there were political advisers on Sage . 
" If you are giving science advice , your advice should be free of any political bias , " he said . 
" That is just so critically important . " 
Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting , King replied : " Oh my goodness . 
Is not this maybe why they do not want us to know who was there ? "
