Downing Street has issued a second response to the Guardian ’s report that Boris Johnson ’s top political adviser , Dominic Cummings , is on the secret scientific group advising the government on the pandemic . 
It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are ‘ on ’ or members of Sage . 
Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual . 
They do this in order to understand better the scientific debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions . 
Occasionally , they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall . 
Others also listen to meetings without being ‘ on ’ or ‘ a member of ’ Sage . 
Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government . 
Political advisers have no role in this . 
The scientists on Sage are among the most eminent in their fields . 
It is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply their advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions . 
The prime minister wants his advisers to understand the scientific debates around Covid as well as they can for obvious reasons . 
From the start , the government has tried hard to integrate scientific advice into its decision making in a sensible way . 
It will continue to do so . 
Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this .
