Trump is being asked about the clinical trials in place looking at the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine , and why he does not wait for science to confirm that it is safe . 
If it was safe and effective doctors could already prescribe it – it ’s already on the market – so why are not they , if it ’s definitely safe ? 
Because we ’ll only know in about a year , year and a half , Trump says . 
" It may not work , in which case - Hey , it did not work – or it may save lives . " 
" I do not wait a year and a half to find out . 
And only CNN would ask that question . 
Fake news . "
