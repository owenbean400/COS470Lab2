Researchers have raised fears that " systematic racism " in the provision of protective equipment was putting minority health workers at greater risk on Friday , as a study showed higher coronavirus infection rates among British and American medical staff . 
The report , published in the Lancet Public Health journal , found that frontline healthcare workers were over three times more likely to test positive than the general population early in the pandemic , with the rate rising to five times for ethnic minority medical staff . 
Researchers from the US looked at data from almost 100,000 healthcare workers in Britain and the United States taken from self reported information on the Covid Symptoms Study smartphone app between 24 March and 23 April , according to Reuters . 
They found that the prevalence of infection among frontline care workers was 2,747 per 100,000 app users , compared with 242 per 100,000 in the general community . 
When they took into account the health workers ’ greater access to testing , the researchers estimated that frontline medical workers were around 3.4 times more likely to test positive for Covid 19 than app users in the wider population . 
After accounting for pre existing medical conditions , researchers estimated that healthcare workers from black , Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were almost five times more likely to report a positive Covid 19 result than somebody from the general community . 
The study also found that frontline healthcare workers who said they did not have sufficient protective equipment – like masks , gloves and gowns – were 1.3 times more likely to test positive than those who said they had the proper equipment .
