The Brazilian president , Jair Bolsonaro , shook hands with a crowd of cheering supporters packed shoulder to shoulder on a visit to the far south of the country on Friday , after revealing the night before that he is taking antibiotics for a lung infection . 
Bolsonaro has previously tested positive three times for the coronavirus , but , according to one source , doctors accompanying him on the trip have not linked the lung infection to his recent bout with Covid 19 . 
Despite physical distancing guidelines , he has often come into close contact with supporters , attending rallies and working the rope line during public appearances . 
On Friday , he said he would continue to leave Brasilia and travel " at least once a week " . 
In a video Bolsonaro posted on Twitter , he showed his face briefly before donning a mask while greeting a raucous crowd in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul . 
He later held up a small child . 
Bolsonaro has also used his public appearances to tout the anti malarial drug hydroxychloroquine , which he credits for his recovery from Covid 19 despite a lack of scientific evidence . 
Supporters cheered the president on Friday as he lifted a box of the drug over his head .
