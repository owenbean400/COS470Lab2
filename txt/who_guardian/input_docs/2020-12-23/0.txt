In South Africa , the current rate of coronavirus infections is expected to soon surpass the record set during the first wave of the virus earlier this year , the health ministry warned . 
Positive cases have increased by 14,046 , increasing the total infection number to 954,258 . 
The positivity rate is at 26 % , double the average rate of infection seen before December when the virus showed signs of decline . 
But following the discovery of the new variant , South Africa â€™s health department said it was likely the cause of the recent surge . 
The World Health Organization and local officials have said that the variant discovered in South Africa is different from the one found in Britain , despite both being more transmissible than the previously circulating variants . 
In a statement , the Ministry of Health wrote that South Africans would need to " review the current restrictions and consider further measures to ensure that we curb the alarming rate of spread . " 
Today we report , with concern , a cumulative total of 954 258 cases of # COVID19 , with 14 046 new cases identified since the last report at a positivity rate of 26 % .
