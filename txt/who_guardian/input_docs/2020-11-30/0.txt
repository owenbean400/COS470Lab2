Spending time with friends and family at Christmas is " not worth putting them or yourself at risk " , according to the head of the World Health Organization . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the body â€™s director general , said people should consider whether travelling during the festive period is necessary . 
Urging " extreme caution " , he said that " gains can easily be lost " . 
He said : " We all need to consider whose life we might be gambling with in the decisions we make . 
[ The ] Covid 19 pandemic will change the way we celebrate , but it does not mean that we ca not celebrate . 
We still can celebrate . " 
He warned that " this is no time for complacency , " despite last week seeing the first decline in newly reported cases globally since September .
