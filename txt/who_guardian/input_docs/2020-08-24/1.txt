The first cases of coronavirus have been detected outside of quarantine facilities within the Gaza Strip , Palestinian officials have announced , a potentially disastrous development given the enclave ’s fragile health system . 
Four people from the same family have so far tested positive for coronavirus , Gaza ’s interior ministry said as authorities imposed a 48 hour lockdown . 
" As soon as the virus cases were detected , the leadership of the interior ministry and the crisis unit held intensive meetings . 
It is currently in session and closely following all the details , " said interior ministry spokesman Iyad al Bazam . 
Hamas authorities urged Gazans to abide by the immediate shutdown , which includes the closure of workplaces , schools and mosques . 
Gaza has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since 2007 and access to the enclave was further restricted following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic . 
Those granted permission to enter the strip have been held in special quarantine centres for three weeks . 
There have been 109 coronavirus infections registered among those quarantined , with one death , according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization . 
The arrival of coronavirus among the broader population in Gaza , a densely populated area home to two million Palestinians , has been feared for months . 
Suhair Zakkout , a spokeswoman for the ICRC in Gaza , said a coronavirus outbreak would be " catastrophic " . 
" The health system is already weakened by the restriction of movement , lack of financial resources , and the Palestinian internal differences , " she told the Guardian . 
Gaza is currently facing severe power shortages after Israel cut off fuel supplies in response to incendiary balloons being flown across the frontier , which have set farmland ablaze . 
Rockets have also been fired from the enclave this month and the Israeli army has repeatedly struck Hamas targets , sparking concerns of a military escalation .
