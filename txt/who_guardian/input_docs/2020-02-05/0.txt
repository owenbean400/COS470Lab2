African governments remain under pressure from citizens to arrange their evacuation from China amid fears of the outbreak reaching the continent . 
So far , most have resisted the calls but Kenyan officials have said they will evacuate 85 of their citizens who are under lockdown in Wuhan city , when restrictions on movements are lifted by Chinese authorities . 
The Star newspaper in Nairobi reported the decision along with comments from Kenya ’s ambassador to China , Sarah Serem , who last week said Kenya " will not risk further infection by flying any citizens back from China on the basis that it would be better if Kenyans in China were monitored and protected as China found a way to terminate the highly infectious virus . 
" I do not think Kenya is ready to deal with the virus . 
The government of China is in a better position to deal with the virus and bringing Kenyans in China back to Kenya will only further expose the rest to the danger of infection , " the newspaper quoted the ambassador as saying . 
Serem ’s comments underline the significant concerns over the potential consequences of an outbreak of the virus in Africa . 
The World Health Organization said yesterday the coronavirus outbreak " is a high risk globally and Africa has close ties with China and other Asian countries " . 
Dr Michel Yao , the emergency operations programme manager in WHO ’s regional office for Africa , said health officials were prioritising stopping transmission from affected countries and ensuring that capacity exists to isolate and to provide appropriate treatment to any confirmed cases . 
" What we are emphasising to all countries is that at least they have early detection because we know how fragile is the health system in the African continent and these systems are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks , " Yao told reporters . 
Many airlines have suspended or restricted flights to China from Africa , where there is yet to be a confirmed case of the virus .
