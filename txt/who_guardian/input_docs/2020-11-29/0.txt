The WHO delivered 15 ventilators to hospitals in Gaza on Sunday as the Palestinian territory suffers a rise in Covid 19 infections . 
The donation was funded by Kuwait and came a week after local and international public health advisers said the territory ’s hospitals could soon become overwhelmed . 
" These devices will help medical teams provide better service to patients , but it is not enough , " said Abdullatif Alhaj of Gaza ’s health ministry , adding that hospitals had suffered acute oxygen shortages . 
The health ministry said more than than half of the territory ’s 150 ventilators were in use . 
There are 342 Covid 19 patients in Gaza ’s hospitals , including 108 in a critical condition .
