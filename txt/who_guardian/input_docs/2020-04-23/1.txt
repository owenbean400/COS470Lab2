Cameroon has freed over 1,300 prisoners in its two main cities in an effort to ease overcrowding and limit the spread of the coronavirus , officials have said . 
President Paul Biya signed a decree to commute sentences and free some prisoners in April , AFP reports . 
The country â€™s justice minister said that 608 prisoners had been freed in Doula , the economic capital , and another 700 released in the capital Yaounde . 
More prisoners in other areas are in the process of being released , the ministry said , with the exact number to be determined by commissions put in place to study who is eligible . 
Cameroon has officially registered 1,163 coronavirus infections and 42 deaths , making it the second most affected country in sub Saharan Africa after South Africa . 
Cameroon has a prison population of around 30,000 with more than half of those awaiting sentencing and mostly held in overcrowded facilities . 
As well as overcrowding , poor hygiene conditions and a high rate of illnesses including tuberculosis , cholera and AIDS make the prison populations vulnerable . 
This follows warnings from criminal justice experts that chronic overcrowding and underfunding have left prisons around the world vulnerable to being devastated by the coronavirus .
