The World Health Organization â€™s emergency committee will meet on Thursday , the third time in a week , to evaluate whether the new coronavirus spreading from China constitutes an international emergency , the WHO said . 
" The committee will advise the director general on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern ( PHEIC ) , and what recommendations should be made to manage it , " the WHO said in a statement issued in Geneva before a news briefing by senior WHO expert Mike Ryan on his return from China . 
The emergency committee , composed of 16 independent experts , twice last week declined to declare a global emergency . 
But today , the WHO chief , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , who recently returned from a trip to China , tweeted that he would reconvene the committee to discuss whether such a declaration was now warranted . 
I have decided to reconvene the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the new # coronavirus ( 2019 n Co V ) tomorrow to advise me on whether the current outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern .
