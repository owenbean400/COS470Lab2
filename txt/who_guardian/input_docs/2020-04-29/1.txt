In Washington , the US president Donald Trump has suggested a vaccine may not be needed as part of a recovery from the pandemic . 
If you do not have a vaccine , if the virus is gone , you ’re like where we were before . 
At least 89 vaccines are in development , according to the World Health Organization . 
But even the most promising options still need to undergo rigorous safety testing , which could take a year to 18 months . 
But without a vaccine , why does Trump think the pandemic will just go away ? 
He dodged the question . 
" It ’s gonna go , it ’s gonna leave , " Trump said , without explaining his thinking . 
" It ’s gonna be eradicated . "
