The World Health Organization ’s representative in Equatorial Guinea has been ordered to leave the country , after officials accused her of falsifying coronavirus case numbers . 
In a document seen by AFP on Tuesday , the foreign ministry asked the UN health agency ’s regional office in Africa " to end the duties " of its representative in Equatorial Guinea , Triphonie Nkurunziza , " and immediately oversee her departure from Malabo . " 
The prime minister , Pascual Obama Asue , appearing at the Senate last Friday , accused Nkurunziza of " falsifying the data of people contaminated " by the coronavirus . 
" We do not have a problem with the WHO , we have a problem with the WHO ’s representative in Malabo , " he said in remarks broadcast on state television . 
A source at the UN office in Malabo , speaking on condition of anonymity , confirmed the government ’s request but declined to go into details . 
" The government has asked her to go , we have received a document - she is accused of falsifying Covid 19 figures , " the source said . 
However , Nkurunziza is still in Malabo , Equatorial Guinea ’s island capital , as there are no flights enabling her to leave , the source said . 
Officials say that as of Monday there were 1,306 recorded cases of coronavirus , 12 of them fatalities , in a population of 1.3 million . 
The official tally used to be updated daily , but this practice stopped on 28 April , and the update is now being published only from time to time . 
Figures put forward by the WHO have sometimes been somewhat higher than the national tally , although both tolls are the same right now .
