" With regard to us they ’re taking a lot of heat . 
They did not want the borders closed . 
They called it wrong . 
They really called every aspect of it wrong . " 
" They seem to be very China centric .

" I did not say I was going to do it " , he says ( he did ) . 
He says he ’s looking into it .
