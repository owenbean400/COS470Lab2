Top officials from several UN agencies appealed for urgent international financial support in Yemen with coronavirus spreading in the country . 
" We are increasingly alarmed about the situation in Yemen , " officials from the UN Humanitarian Affairs Department , UNICEF , the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement . 
" We are running out of time , " they said . 
The United Nations says COVID 19 has likely already spread throughout most of Yemen , which was already immersed in the world ’s worst humanitarian crisis because of a war that shows no sign of abating . 
The UN officials said they currently have enough " skills , staff and capacity . " 
" What we do not have is the money . 
We ask donors to pledge generously and pay pledges promptly , " they said , noting that a donors conference has been organized for June 2 by Saudi Arabia and the United Nations . 
Mark Lowcock , the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs , said $ 2.4 billion needed to be raised by the end of the year for Yemen , including $ 180 million to combat the COVID 19 pandemic . 
" Yemen is in desperate need of assistance , " Muhannad Hadi of the World Food Programme said , while UNICEF ’s director , Henriette Fore , warned of a " major disaster . "
