The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support " speculative " claims by the US president that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab , AFP reports . 
" We have not received any data or specific evidence from the United States government relating to the purported origin of the virus - so from our perspective , this remains speculative , " WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual briefing . 
Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans , emerging in China late last year , possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat . 
But US President Donald Trump , increasingly critical of China â€™s management of the first outbreak , claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory . 
And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said " enormous evidence " backed up that claim , which China has vehemently denied . 
" Like any evidence based organisation , we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus , " Ryan said , stressing that this was " a very important piece of public health information for future control . 
" If that data and evidence is available , then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared , but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard , " he added .
