Kate Green , Labour â€™s shadow education secretary , has called the Department of Education change on face coverings a " half baked U turn " . 
Parents and schools needed clarity and leadership , but instead the government have just passed the buck back to them . 
Face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas in schools . 
Instead of this half baked U turn the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it . 
Geoff Barton , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , welcomed the " flexibility " of the change in advice on face coverings in secondary schools . 
It was inevitable that the policy on face coverings would change following guidance from the World Health Organization , and we recognise that the government in Westminster has responded to our call for a quick direction on this matter with the reopening of schools imminent . 
The new policy is discretionary , other than in places where coronavirus restrictions apply , and secondary school and college leaders will welcome the flexibility this affords them to decide what best suits their circumstances . 
We look forward to seeing the full guidance as early as possible .
