Yemen has confirmed its first case , its internationally recognised government has announced . 
The case is a 73 year old Yemeni national who works at the port of al Shahr in Hadramawt province , Yemen ’s minister of health Nasser Baoum has told the Associated Press . 
The man is in stable condition , the minister added , without providing further details . 
The news is stoking fears that an outbreak could devastate the war torn country ’s already crippled health care system . 
Yemen is a uniquely dangerous place for the virus to spread . 
Repeated bombings and ground fighting over five years of war have destroyed or closed more than half its health facilities . 
Deep poverty , dire water shortages and a lack of adequate sanitation have made the country a breeding ground for disease . 
Health officials have dreaded the virus eventual appearance in the country . 
Altaf Musani , a representative of the World Health Organization in Yemen , said : We have been saying since the declaration of the pandemic that the introduction of such a case in Yemen would be catastrophic . 
The Saudi led coalition fighting the Iran backed Houthi rebels declared a ceasefire on Thursday on humanitarian grounds – partly , they claimed , to prevent the spread of the pandemic . 
However , fighting continued unabated on Friday , diminishing hopes of a truce that could open doors for peace talks .
