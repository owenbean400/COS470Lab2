In a virtual briefing , Etienne said Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) , WHO ’s regional office based in Washington , was to working to " ensure the most vulnerable countries in the region receive the Covid 19 vaccine on a subsidised basis and at an affordable price " . 
The global race for a vaccine and treatments has turned into a battle between the world ’s wealthiest nations , with rich countries buying up limited drug stocks or procuring future supplies of the most promising potential vaccines .
