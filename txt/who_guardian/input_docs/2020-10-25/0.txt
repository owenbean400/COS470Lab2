The head of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on Sunday called for global solidarity in the rollout of any future coronavirus vaccine , as the number of cases soared across the world . 
In a video address at the opening of the three day World Health Summit in Berlin , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the only way to recover from the pandemic was together and by making sure poorer countries had fair access to a vaccine . 
" It is natural that countries want to protect their own citizens first but if and when we have an effective vaccine , we must also use it effectively . 
And the best way to do that is to vaccinate some people in all countries rather than all people in some countries , " he said . 
" Let me be clear : vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic , not shorten it . " 
Scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid 19 , which has killed over 1.1 million people globally . 
Several dozen vaccine candidates are currently being tested in clinical trials , ten of which are in the most advanced " phase 3 " stage involving tens of thousands of volunteers , AFP reports . 
The European Union , the US , Britain , Japan and a slew of other nations have already placed large orders with the companies involved in developing the most promising vaccines . 
But concerns are growing that countries with smaller wallets could be left at the back of the queue . 
The WHO has launched an international scheme known as Covax to help ensure equitable access to jabs , but it has struggled to raise the funds needed .
