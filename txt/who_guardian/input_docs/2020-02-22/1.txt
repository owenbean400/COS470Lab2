Should we panic about the spread of coronavirus ? 
My Guardian colleagues Sarah Boseley , Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam have the answer to that question and others in this explainer . 
For the record , their answer on whether we should panic is : No . 
The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development . 
The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern . 
The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people , and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital . 
Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact . 
Generally , the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest , with few cases in children .
