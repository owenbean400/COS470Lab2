Iran , facing the potential closure of some of its borders , has ordered extra supplies of face masks , disinfectants and gloves as worried Iranians responded to the sudden outbreak of coronavirus that has so far claimed five lives in the country . 
The health ministry announced on Saturday that 10 new cases of coronavirus had been detected , including one person who has died . 
Both Iraq and Turkey were placing restrictions on visitors from Iran . 
A health ministry spokesman , Kianush Jahanpur , said the new numbers brought the total number of cases of the new coronavirus in Iran to 28 , with five deaths . 
Extra diagnostic supplies have been sent to the country by the World Health Organization . 
The ministry said it would take steps to prevent pharmacists exploiting the rise in demand for masks amid reports that prices were being doubled or even inflated by five times . 
The number of people wearing masks has visibly increased over the past 48 hours in the capital , Tehran , with some commuters avoiding the underground and other crowded public spaces . 
Earlier reports said two patients had died in Qom on Thursday . 
Most of the new cases include people living in Qom and those who have visited the religious city , an hour â€™s drive south of Tehran , during the past week . 
A local Tehran mayor was among those reported to have contracted the virus , provoking concern that other politicians that had recently met with him were at risk . 
At one point it was reported that Tehran city council was to be shut for a week , but this was later denied . 
Jahanpur said earlier that 735 patients with symptoms similar to flu had been hospitalised in various cities .
