Lebanon has announced a record daily number of Covid 19 infections , more than 300 , and seven deaths from the virus as the country grapples with the aftermath of the port explosion that rocked Beirut and overwhelmed hospitals . 
The country â€™s totals now stand at 7,121 cases and 87 deaths since February , according to health ministry data . 
Even before the blast there had been a recent surge in infections . 
The 4 August explosion killed at least 171 people , injured about 6,000 and damaged swathes of the capital , leaving around 300,000 people without habitable housing . 
Hospitals , many of which were damaged and their staff injured , were overwhelmed with wounded people . 
The World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jarasevic told a United Nations briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that the displacement of so many people risked accelerating the spread of Covid 19 . 
The WHO on 7 August issued an appeal for $ 15m to cover emergency health needs in Lebanon , where the healthcare sector was already under strain owing to shortages of medical supplies and medicine caused by a deep financial crisis . 
" The emergency in Beirut has caused many Covid 19 precautionary measures to be relaxed , raising the prospects of even higher transmission rates and a large caseload in coming weeks , " the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report on 10 August . 
It said at least 15 medical facilities , including three major hospitals , sustained partial or heavy structural damage from the blast . 
An assessment of 55 primary healthcare centres in Beirut showed only 47 % could still provide full routine services .
