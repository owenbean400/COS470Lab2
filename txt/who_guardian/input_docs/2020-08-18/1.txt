Zimbabwe has shortened an overnight curfew imposed to combat the coronavirus pandemic and extended business hours despite rising cases , the government said after a weekly cabinet meeting . 
President Emmerson Mnangagwa last month announced a 6pm to 6am curfew , but the information minister Monica Mutsvangwa said this had left commuters stranded without transport . 
The overnight curfew will now start at 8pm , while business hours will be extended to 4.30pm from 3pm . 
Zimbabwe has recorded 5,308 cases and 135 deaths . 
Officials fear a wholesale removal of restrictions on movement would see a surge in infections and overwhelm a health sector that is collapsing due to strikes by workers and lack of medicines and protective clothing . 
The government banned public taxis in March , but the state bus service is failing to cope , forcing commuters to queue well beyond curfew hours .
