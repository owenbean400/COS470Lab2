The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte tightened recommended measures to rein in the spread of coronavirus , warning that if the country does not control new infections the Netherlands could go " back to square one " . 
Rutte gave people urgent advice not to hold parties at home and to limit events like birthday celebrations and other private house gatherings to a maximum of six people . 
However , the Dutch government did not impose any new mandatory restrictions . 
" If were not careful , we will be back to square one inside the foreseeable future , " Rutte warned . 
" If people want to organise parties for more than six people , they should rent a space where all guests can maintain social distance while seated , " the prime minister said . 
He also urged people to continue working from home . 
His comments came after the Dutch public health institute announced that there had been just over 4,000 new confirmed cases in the Netherlands over the last week , around the same number as the previous week . 
The percentage of positive tests in the country edged very slightly lower to 3.5 % . 
The confirmed Covid 19 death toll in the Netherlands stood at 6,175 as of Tuesday , although the true figure is believed to be higher because many people thought to have died were not tested . 
The number of new confirmed cases has been on the rise since the Netherlands removed most of its coronavirus restrictions on 1 July . 
Students returned to high schools in the country â€™s north this week for the first time in months without requirements for face masks or social distancing between children . 
To prevent infections at schools , Rutte said students must stay home if they have coronavirus symptoms and if somebody in their family tested positive for the virus . 
We showed between March and June that we could , together , get on top of the virus . 
Now we have to show that we can keep the virus under control together .
