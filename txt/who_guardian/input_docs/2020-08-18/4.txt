The Canadian province of Quebec on Tuesday announced plans to tackle earlier mistakes in fighting the Covid 19 pandemic , while preparing its health sector against a possible second wave of coronavirus in the autumn . 
Quebec , once the country ’s hardest hit province , will boost public health sector hiring , reduce screening delays , and ensure staff like orderlies can no longer work at multiple long term care facilities , a practice previously blamed for spreading the virus , the health minister Christian Dubé told reporters . 
Canada has flattened its curve of coronavirus cases since the spring , but some of the country ’s 10 provinces have reported higher numbers of Covid 19 infections recently , as the economy restarts and restrictions on social gathering are relaxed . 
Schools across Canada will be reopening in autumn . 
Quebec accounts for about half the country ’s 122,872 total coronavirus cases and more than half of its 9,032 deaths . 
But the once hard hit province has only reported 46 new cases and two deaths in the last 24 hours , according to government data . 
" We have done an appraisal of this first wave so we can now establish the solution to be implemented in view of a potential second wave , " Dubé said . 
There will no longer be movement of workers , other than nurses under certain conditions , between seniors ’ homes , where most of the province ’s 5,727 Covid 19 deaths took place . 
Under the plan , Quebec will also invest C$106m ( £ 61m ) in public health to allow for the hiring of 1,000 workers to carry out contact tracing and infection control .
