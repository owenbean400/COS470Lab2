The World Health Organization has urged people to keep calm , saying that ministers across the world need to be able to answer questions on how they are preparing to halt the spread of the virus . 
The WHO â€™s message continues to be that the virus " has pandemic potential " and it is helping every country to prepare . 
The director general of the WHO , Tedros Adhanom , said countries needed to be ready to detect cases early and isolate patients . 
They needed the right measures at airports and border crossings . 
He said countries needed to be ready to fight rumours and misinformation . 
" This is not a time for fear but a time for taking action now to prevent infection and save lives now , " Adhanom said . 
" Fear and panic does not help , " he added .
