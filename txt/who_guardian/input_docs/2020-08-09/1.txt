Britain ’s confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 1,062 on Sunday , going over 1,000 for the first time since late June . 
As cases rise in the country , new local lockdowns are implemented in some areas and worries over a second wave of infections are rife . 
Official data showed Sunday ’s reported cases are 304 higher than the 758 new cases reported on Saturday . 
In mid June , the World Health Organization advised that England ’s coronavirus lockdown should not be further lifted until the government ’s contact tracing system has proven to be " robust and effective " , after widespread criticism of the first results of the government ’s new tracking operation . 
Non essential shops began reopening in England and Northern Ireland in mid June , and in Wales and Scotland later that month . 
Hotels , pubs and restaurants in England , Scotland and Northern Ireland followed suit in July , though customers were only allowed back inside Welsh pubs and cafes in the first week of August .
