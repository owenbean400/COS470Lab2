Trump â€™s announcement that he is pulling the US out of the WHO came three weeks ahead of an ultimatum he laid down earlier this month . 
On 19 May , the US president sent a four page letter to the WHO director general Dr Tedros warning he would permanently cut US funding of the WHO and reconsider US membership if the organisation did " not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days " . 
He has made the break only 10 days later , falsely claiming that " China has total control over " the global health body . 
Trump said : We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly , but they have refused to act because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms . 
We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs . 
The move will confirm the suspicions of many in the WHO and in western capitals that the US was seeking reforms and a dialogue was a smokescreen for a politically motivated break with the WHO . 
Beth Cameron , a biologist and former senior official in the National Security Council tweeted : There are not words for how much this decision will hurt the US , our global partners , and our ability to to impact the # COVID19 pandemic that is a threat to our national and global peace and security .
