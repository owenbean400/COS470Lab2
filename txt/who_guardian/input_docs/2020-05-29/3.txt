British experts have warned of the folly of terminating Washington ’s relationship with the WHO during a pandemic . 
Dr Stephen Griffin , an associate professor in the School of Medicine , University of Leeds , said : There is no logic to the move by President Trump to sever links with the WHO . 
Pandemics are , by definition , a global crisis . 
To not face Covid 19 with a united front seems futile . 
Given the scale of the outbreak in the US , this action appears nothing short of an attempt to refocus attention away from how this has been handled . 
Dr Gail Carson , the director of network development at the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium , said during a pandemic is not the time to make health political . 
The consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Oxford , added : If there was a time not to make health political it is now , when the world is in the throes of a pandemic . 
Now is the time for solidarity and to stand together to end the pandemic as soon as we can and to save lives . 
Is this US government decision going to do good to all ? 
WHO stands for the health of all of us and should not be ‘ punished ’ by any country in the middle of a pandemic because of an opinion , certainly not before any action review process has taken place . 
Now is not the time to weaken the world ’s leading health agency , who has shown strong leadership with strong technical messages throughout this pandemic .
