All adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week , even more vital for well being and mental health in the Covid 19 era , the World Health Organization said in its first guidance in a decade . 
It recommended that children and adolescents have an average of one hour of daily physical exercise and limit time in front of electronic screens . 
And people of all ages must compensate for growing sedentary behaviour with physical activity to ward off disease and add years to their lives , the WHO said , launching its " Every Move Counts " campaign . 
" These guidelines emphasise what many are experiencing during the Covid restrictions that are applied all over the world . 
And that is that being active every day is good not only our bodies but also our mental health , " said Fiona Bull , head of WHO â€™s physical activity unit . 
" Phone a friend and do classes online together , help your family members , do it as a family . 
And when you can , get outside , " she said . 
Pregnant women and postpartum mothers are now included in the recommendations of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for adults . 
This brings health benefits for both the mother and baby , according to Juana Willumsen , a WHO technical officer . 
" For example there is a 30 % reduction in gestational diabetes amongst women who are physically active during pregnancy , " she said . 
Adults above 65 are advised to add muscle strengthening and activities focusing on balance and coordination to help prevent falls later .
