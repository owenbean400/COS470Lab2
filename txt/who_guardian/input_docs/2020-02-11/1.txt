The use of the term ‘ super spreader ’ to describe individuals who inadvertently infect others with coronavirus is " deeply , deeply unhelpful " , according to a leading WHO official . 
Dr Michael Ryan , executive director at the WHO Health Emergencies Programme , said : I really wish we could refrain from personalising these issues down to individuals who spread disease . 
This is deeply , deeply unhelpful People are not at fault - they are never at fault in this situation , so let ’s be extremely careful here , it ’s really really important that we do not attach unnecessary stigma to this . 
He added that the case in which a British businessman inadvertently infected at least 11 people was by no means a " massive ‘ super spreading ’ event . 
This is an unusual event and it is a wake up call because there may be other circumstances in which this disease can spread like this , so we need to study those circumstances for sure , but it does not change our overall assessment .
