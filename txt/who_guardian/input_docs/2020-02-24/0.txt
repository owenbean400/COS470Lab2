The World Health Organization has played down fears of a coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world , despite sudden serious outbreaks in Italy and Iran , but some experts said they believed it was now inevitable . 
" Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts , but it may certainly cause fear , " said the WHO ’s director general , Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , at a briefing . 
We are not there yet , said Tedros . 
" What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways . " 
Other experts said it was hard to believe that COVID 19 would not now spread worldwide . 
" We now consider this to be a pandemic in all but name , and it ’s only a matter of time before the World Health Organization starts to use the term in its communications , " said Dr Bharat Pankhania , from the University of Exeter Medical School .
