Young people are as diligent about coronavirus hygiene routines as their older peers but also more stressed out by the pandemic and willing to give up a higher percentage of their income to stop it , according to a global survey that calls into question the stereotype of feckless youth driving up infection rates . 
A new survey , which polled the pandemic behaviour of nearly 12,000 respondents from more than 130 countries , found that 18-25 year olds were only marginally less likely to take regular measures to protect themselves than those aged 45 or older . 
In fact , young people in some countries , such as the UK , made up the age group that was most compliant with new hygiene rules and restrictions . 
Across the globe , politicians and health officials have in recent weeks pointed the finger at young partygoers and rule breakers as being responsible for a second Covid 19 wave , with the WHO â€™s regional director for Europe complaining that those in their late teens and early 20s felt " invincible " .
