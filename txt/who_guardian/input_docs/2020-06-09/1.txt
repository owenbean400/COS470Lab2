Portugal ’s government expects a deficit equal to 6.3 % of GDP in 2020 because of the pandemic , budget secretary of state João Leão has said , foreshadowing a painful setback after the country had its first budget surplus in 45 years at the end of 2019 . 
The pandemic dented a € 4.4bn ( £ 3.91bn ) hole in public revenues , amounting to 5 % of the state budget , Leão said , largely due to a fall in tax and social security payments . 
Government spending was € 4.3bn higher than predicted , Leão added .
