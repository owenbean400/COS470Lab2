Population wide facemask use could push transmission down to controllable levels for national epidemics and could prevent further waves when combined with lockdowns , according to a UK study . 
The research , led by scientists at Cambridge and Greenwich universities , suggests lockdowns alone will not stop a resurgence , but that even homemade masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public . 
Richard Stutt , who co led the study at Cambridge , said : Our analyses support the immediate and universal adoption of facemasks by the public . 
He said the findings showed that , if widespread mask use were combined with social distancing and some lockdown measures , this could be an " acceptable way of managing the pandemic and reopening economic activity " long before the development and public availability of an effective vaccine . 
The study â€™s findings were published in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society A " scientific journal . 
The World Health Organization updated its guidance on Friday to recommend that governments ask everyone to wear fabric face masks in public areas where there is a risk to reduce the spread of the disease .
