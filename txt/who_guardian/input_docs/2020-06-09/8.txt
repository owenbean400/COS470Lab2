In England , zoos , safari parks and drive in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June , as the UK ’s prime minister announces the latest easing of the country ’s lockdown measures . 
Boris Johnson will update the nation on Wednesday as he tries to reopen the economy while minimising the rate of transmission and strident criticism from many , who believe his government ’s preparations have been inadequate . 
Under pressure from zoos warning they face an exponential threat , Johnson will say they can reopen next week as long as they can uphold social distancing rules . 
He will also announce the easing of restrictions on outdoor attractions where people remain in their cars , such as safari parks and drive in cinemas , because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside .
