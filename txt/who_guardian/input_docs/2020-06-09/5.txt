Morocco will start easing restrictions , though a full lifting of the state of emergency will be delayed until 10 July , Rabat has said . 
The country has been on lockdown since 20 March . 
The gradual relaxation will take into account disparities in the infection rate between Moroccan regions , the government added . 
The prime minister Saad Dine El Otmani is expected to brief the parliament on the next steps on Wednesday . 
Morocco has confirmed 8,437 cases , including 210 deaths , as the rise of hot spots within factories and families complicates efforts to curb contagion .
