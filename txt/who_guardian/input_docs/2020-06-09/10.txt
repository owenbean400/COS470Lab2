Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections , the World Health Organization has advised . 
The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions , Agence France Press ( AFP ) reported . 
Since the start of Pakistan ’s outbreak in March , the prime minister Imran Khan has opposed a nationwide lockdown , arguing the impoverished country cannot not afford it . 
Instead , Pakistan ’s four provinces ordered a patchwork of closures . 
But , last week , Khan said most of these restrictions would be lifted . 
That decision came as Pakistan ’s infection rate was worsening , as it is across all of South Asia , which had been less severely affected than many other regions of the globe .
