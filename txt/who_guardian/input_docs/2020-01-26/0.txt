Nathalie Mac Dermott , NIHR ( National Institute for Health Research ) academic clinical lecturer , at King â€™s College London , has said the suggestion that coronavirus is infectious during the incubation period is " not surprising " , adding : This was taken account of in some of the modelling exercises undertaken by colleagues recently , and was likely given the degree of spread of the outbreak within China . 
There is often the question of whether individuals who may be infected with the virus but never show any symptoms ( asymptomatic or subclinical cases ) may also be contagious to others . 
The report from Zhejiang suggests this may be the case , but further confirmation is required . 
This report highlights the importance of identifying individuals who may have travelled from affected regions or had contact with a known case of 2019 n Co V infection to establish if they may have symptoms and to request they limit their attendance at public gatherings in order to try and contain the spread of infection . 
While these findings may cause concern , the possibility of transmission of virus during the incubation period and from asymptomatic individuals has been considered by public health authorities and the WHO , and has been included as a factor within response plans to tackle an outbreak of an airborne virus .
