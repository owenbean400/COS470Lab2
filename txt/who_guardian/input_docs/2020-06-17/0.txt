The cheap steroid British researchers believe can help save lives should be used only for the most serious cases , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has said . 
The WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said research was at last providing " green shoots of hope " . 
Trial results announced on Tuesday showed dexamethasone , a generic drug used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation in diseases such as arthritis , cut death rates by around a third among the most severely ill patients admitted to hospital . 
The head of the WHO â€™s emergencies programme , Dr Mike Ryan , said the drug should only be used in the cases where it has been shown to help . 
It is exceptionally important in this case , that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly .
