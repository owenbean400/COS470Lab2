Here ’s a little more detail on that WHO announcement that about 120m rapid diagnostic tests are to be made available to low - and middle income countries at a maximum of $ 5 ( £ 3.83 , € 4.23 ) per unit . 
The body ’s director general , Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , said : This will enable the expansion of testing , particularly in hard to reach areas that do not have laboratory facilities or enough trained health workers to carry out tests This is a vital addition to the testing capacity and especially important in areas of high transmission . 
Dr Catharina Boehme , the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics ( FIND ) , a Geneva based non profit organisation in the project , said the deal was a " major milestone " as it was urgent to increase testing in poorer countries . 
It is our first line of defence , critical for countries to track , trace and isolate to stop the spread of the virus and to ensure that we are not flying blind . 
We now have two high quality tests , which are the first in a series that are being developed and assessed by WHO for emergency use listing . 
The antigen tests , which do not require a laboratory , provide reliable results in just 15 minutes , rather than hours or days , and will help expand testing , Boehme said , adding : " The tests are as simple to use as pregnancy tests . " 
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria – another Geneva based group – was providing an initial $ 50m the procurement fund and the first orders were expected to be placed this week , she said . 
Dr Maria Van Kerkhove , the WHO ’s technical lead on Covid 19 , said more tests were undergoing evaluation and would come online . 
They would be particularly useful in remote settings and to investigate clusters quickly and bring them under control and in areas with widespread community transmission , she said : This will be really , really helpful for communities and countries to be able to know where is the virus and who is infected with the virus .
