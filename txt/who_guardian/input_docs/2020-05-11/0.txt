Senegal is reopening mosques and churches and easing other restrictions , even as it sees its largest one day jump in cases . 
Its president , Macky Sall , ordered places of worship closed in March and imposed a dawn to dusk curfew . 
Since then , the daily pace of new cases has picked up – 177 on Monday from a previous high of 104 – with increasing community transmission in hotspots such as the holy city of Touba . 
Senegal has recorded 1,886 cases in total , including 19 deaths . 
Sall , like other leaders in West Africa , has confronted public pressure to find more sustainable ways to balance public health with economic realities in the face of an epidemic that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has warned could drag on across Africa for years . 
He told the nation : In the best of cases , Covid 19 will continue to circulate in the country until the month of August , or even September . 
In this new phase , that will last not a few weeks but three or four months , we need to learn to live in the presence of the virus .
