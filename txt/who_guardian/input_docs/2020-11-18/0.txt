The WHO ’s emergencies director has warned that vaccines would not arrive in time to defeat the second wave of the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Pfizer said a completed study of its experimental vaccine showed it was 95 per cent effective , while fellow US firm Moderna said this week that its own candidate was 94.5 percent effective . 
Russia claims its candidate is more than 90 percent effective . 
The WHO ’s Michael Ryan said vaccines should not be seen as a " unicorn " magic solution - and countries battling a resurgence of the virus would once again have to " climb this mountain " without them . 
" I think it ’s at least four to six months before we have significant levels of vaccination going on anywhere , " he said . 
Despite recent promising announcements from final phase candidate vaccine trials , " We ’re not there with vaccines yet , " said Ryan . 
" Many countries are going through this wave , and they ’re going to go through this wave , and continue through this wave , without vaccines . 
" We need to understand and internalise that , and realise : we have got to climb this mountain this time , without vaccines . " 
The vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc could be ready for US authorisation and distribution within weeks , setting the stage for inoculation to begin as soon as this year , U.S . Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar . 
" We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks , " Azar said .
