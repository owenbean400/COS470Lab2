The head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) has appealed for the world to work together to develop a vaccine , warning against any unilateral action that could prevent access for poor countries . 
Francesco Rocca , who heads the world â€™s largest disaster relief network , told Reuters : The reality is that there is this risk . 
Everyone must have access to these lifesaving treatments . 
On Tuesday , the United States rejected language in a World Health Organization resolution that was designed to ensure poor countries can have access to medicine , arguing that it sends " the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs " . 
Rocca said : If someone would say this is the intellectual property of this company ... and putting high prices on the vaccines , so making it impossible or very difficult to have access , this of course can have an impact on the most vulnerable . 
We want to prevent some unilateral decision that can effect the opportunity to have treatments and vaccines for everyone .
