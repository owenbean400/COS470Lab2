The World Health Organization has recommended that children over 12 should wear masks in the same contexts as adults in the bid to rein in the Covid 19 pandemic . 
The UN health agency , in cooperation with UNICEF , published fresh guidance on Friday on when it is appropriate for children to wear masks to impede the spread of the coronavirus crisis . 
The two UN agencies had convened a group of experts to review the limited data available on children ’s contribution to the spread of COVID 19 , as well as on the benefits of mask wearing by children . 
Based on those findings , as well as considerations surrounding children ’s developmental needs , they said the advice varied in different age groups . 
WHO thus recommends that " children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults , in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area . " 
The document acknowledged that much remains unknown about to what degree children contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus . 
But it said that while there is some limited evidence that young children may have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults , data indicated that teenagers " may play a more active role in transmission than younger children " . 
The UN agencies said that children under five should not wear a mask . 
It comes after France ’s education minister , Jean Michel Blanquer , said schools will reopen on 1 September as normal , but all staff as well as pupils over the age of 11 must wear masks .
