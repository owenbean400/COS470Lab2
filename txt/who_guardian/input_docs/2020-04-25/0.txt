The chair of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has urged the government to provide all essential workers with face masks to combat the spread of Covid 19 . 
It is currently not compulsory to wear a mask or face covering in public , but ministers are considering recommendations made by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( Sage ) following a review of current advice . 
Dr Chaand Nagpaul , chairman of the BMA council , is calling on the government to ask all members of the public to cover their mouths and noses when going outside . 
He told the Daily Telegraph that the doctors â€™ union believes all key workers outside of the NHS should be provided with masks or suitable face coverings . 
He said this includes " transport workers , shopkeepers , carers or supermarket staff " who are unable to abide by social distancing . 
" Common sense tells you that a barrier between people must offer a level of protection , however small , " Dr Nagpaul said . 
He added : The Government must pursue all avenues of reducing the spread of infection . 
This includes asking the public to wear face coverings to cover mouths and noses when people leave home for essential reasons . " 
He said that until " sufficient supplies of PPE are provided " to the frontline , this may initially mean members of the public wearing cloth masks and scarves . 
Current UK guidance has emphasised the importance of masks for doctors and nurses , but does not suggest widespread usage . 
However , scientific advisers for the government have carried out a review of the use of face masks , despite the World Health Organization ( WHO ) saying that there is no evidence to support their use by the general population .
