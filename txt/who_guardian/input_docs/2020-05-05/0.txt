Prof Neil Ferguson is the academic whose modelling evidence has been central to not just Boris Johnson ’s coronavirus strategy , but for those strategies in France , Germany and the US too . 
His resignation is a huge blow to the government ’s authority on the pandemic . 
It was his work that prompted a seismic shift in government policy in the UK response from essentially letting the virus spread through the population to the wholescale stay at home policy now in place . 
The evidence that changed the government ’s policy came from the centre he founded with colleagues at Imperial College , the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis , which collaborates with the World Health Organization . 
His decision to resign from the government ’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( Sage ) , after allowing his lover to visit him at home during the lockdown while lecturing the public on the need for strict social distancing , will leave a gaping hole for ministers to fill .
