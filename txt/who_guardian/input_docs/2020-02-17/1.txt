It is too early to tell if the recent decline in new coronavirus cases will continue , the World Health Organization chief has said , and data must be interpreted " cautiously " . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of WHO , said in a press conference today : This trend must be interpreted very cautiously . 
Trends can change as new populations are affected . 
It â€™s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue . 
Every scenario is still on the table . 
He added that the virus seems to be " not as deadly as other coronavirus including Sars and Mers " , with the majority of patients making a full recovery . 
More than 80 % of patients have mild disease and will recover . 
In about 14 % of cases , the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath . 
And about 5 % of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure , septic shock and multi organ failure . 
In 2 % of reported cases , the virus is fatal , and the risk of death increases the older you are . 
We see relatively few cases among children . 
More research is needed to understand why .
