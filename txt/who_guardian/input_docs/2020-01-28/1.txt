Andreas Zapf , the president of Bavaria ’s office for health and food safety , said on Tuesday the person infected was 33 years old and had come into contact with a Chinese woman on 21 January . 
Zapf said the woman was from Shanghai but her parents , who are from the Wuhan region , had visited her a few days earlier . 
He added that she had arrived in Germany on 19 January , appearing not to have any symptoms , but began to feel ill on her flight home on 23 January . 
She sought medical treatment after landing and tested positive for coronavirus . 
When that information was relayed back to the German company , a male employee said he felt like he had flu over the weekend and was on Monday advised to get medical treatment .
