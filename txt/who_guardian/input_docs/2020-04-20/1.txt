Fact check : testing quality Trump claimed the US is " way advanced " on testing . 
In fact , some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed . 
Part of the problem came from the CDC shunning the World Health Organization ( WHO ) template for tests , and insisted on developing a more complicated version that correctly identified Covid 19 , but also flagged other viruses – resulting in false positives . 
Other countries – after their first coronavirus case – swiftly asked private companies to develop their own tests . 
South Korea , which recorded its first case on the same day as the US , did so within a week . 
The US only allowed laboratories and hospitals to conduct their own tests on 29 February , almost six weeks after the first case was confirmed .
