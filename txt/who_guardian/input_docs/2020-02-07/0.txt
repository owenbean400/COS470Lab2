A drop in the number of new coronavirus cases for two days is good news , says the director general of the World Health Organization . 
However , he cautions against reading too much into it . 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the numbers could go up again , but the last two days were showing a declining trend . 
There were roughly 3,900 new cases reported worldwide on 5 February , 3,700 on 6 February and 3,200 on 7 February - the vast majority in China , WHO figures show . 
At the Science Media Centre , Paul Hunter , professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia , said : Over the last two days we have actually seen the first of two consecutive declines in the number of new cases , which is nice , but whether that is sustainable or not we will only know in about a week or so . 
The infection , like most droplet spread infections , tend to spread more in winter than in summer , so it â€™s quite plausible that even if the spread does continue , at least in the northern hemisphere we will see a decline during the summer The big question then will be whether it reappears in November as we move into the traditional flu seasons where these sorts of viruses ... tend to predominate . 
Ghebreyesus also reported that in response to his appeal earlier this week for more countries to share information about the outbreaks in their countries , not all nations had provided the requested information . 
" There are some countries who have yet to send detailed case reports to WHO , " he said . 
" We urge those member states to share that information immediately . "
