Earlier the WHO reported that the virus was stable and there was no evidence it was mutating , but Chinese scientists have reported " striking " mutations between family members , the South China Post reports . 
Researchers studying a cluster of infections within a family in the southern province of Guangdong said the genes of the virus went through some significant changes as it spread within the family . 
Viruses mutate all the time , but most changes are synonymous or " silent " , having little effect on the way the virus behaves . 
Others , known as nonsynonymous substitutions , can alter biological traits , allowing them to adapt to different environments . 
Two nonsynonymous changes took place in the viral strains isolated from the family , according to a new study by Professor Cui Jie and colleagues at the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai . 
This case indicated " viral evolution may have occurred during person to person transmission " , they wrote in the paper published in the journal National Science Review on 29 January .
