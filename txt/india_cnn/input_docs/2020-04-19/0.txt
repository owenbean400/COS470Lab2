A groom to be broke India 's nationwide coronavirus lockdown by cycling more than 800 kilometers ( almost 500 miles ) to get back to his hometown to get married . 
But before he could say " I do , " Sonu Kumar Chouhan , a 24 year old factory worker , was stopped by police and put into government quarantine . 
Chouhan told CNN that he was due to get married on April 15 but the nationwide lockdown trapped him in Ludhiana town , in Punjab , where he works . 
His wedding venue was about 1,000 kilometers ( 500 miles ) away in Maharajgunj , Utter Pradesh state . 
" After much discussion with friends , we decided to embark the 1,000 kilometer journey by cycle , " Chouhan said , who traveled with three friends . 
The group 's plan was foiled when they were stopped at a police checkpoint in Utter Pradesh . 
The four men will be sent home from quarantine in 14 days if they do not show symptoms . 
India 's nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 and will remain until May 3 .
