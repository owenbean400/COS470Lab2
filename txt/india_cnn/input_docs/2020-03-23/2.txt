Millions of people across India have been placed under lockdown until the end of the month as efforts to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country intensify . 
Residents living in 75 districts across the country , including in major cities such as the capital New Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore , Chennai , Hyderabad , and Kolkata have been placed under travel , work and movement restrictions until March 31 . 
Using data from the latest government census , which took place in 2011 , more than 750 million people will be impacted by the new restrictions . 
Given that the data is from nine years ago , the actual number of people affected is likely to be much higher . 
In the New Delhi metropolitan area , more than 16 million people have been asked to stay inside their homes . 
Public transportation , including the metro and rickshaws , have been suspended , and all shops , factories , places of worship and offices have been shut . 
More than 12 million people could be affected in the city of Mumbai and 9 million in Bangalore , according to the census data .
