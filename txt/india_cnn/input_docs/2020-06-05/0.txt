Astra Zeneca announced Thursday that it will make 300 million doses of a Covid 19 vaccine candidate from Oxford University scientists by the end of 2020 . 
The UK pharma giant signed what it is calling a " landmark " $ 750 million deal with the Vaccine Alliance Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) . 
CEPI will manufacture the vaccine while Gavi will lead the procurement efforts . 
The company also made a licensing deal with India ’s Serum Institute to make 1 billion doses of the vaccine available in India , as well as developing countries . 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , along with the World Health Organization ’s Access to Covid 19 Tools Accelerator , will make sure that the vaccine is fairly distributed across the world . 
Wait ... a vaccine already ? : Typically , companies wait to start the manufacturing process until after it is known the vaccine is safe and works . 
But with the threat of the pandemic , several drug companies have accelerated this process . 
The Oxford vaccine is currently being tested in about 10,000 adult volunteers . 
The company said on its website that it realizes the vaccine may not work , but at no profit , it is " committed to progressing the clinical programme with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk " and will make sure that it is available to people around the world " including to those in countries with the lowest means .
