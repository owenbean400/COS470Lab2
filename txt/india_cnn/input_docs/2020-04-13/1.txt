An Indian policeman 's hand was chopped off with a sword and six other officers were severely injured when they were attacked while enforcing coronavirus lockdown measures in northern Punjab state on Sunday morning . 
The severed left hand of Harjit Singh , an assistant sub inspector for Punjab Police , was later reattached to his wrist following nearly eight hours of surgery . 
The attack took place when a vehicle carrying seven men -- who belong to the minority Sikh warrior sect known as the Nihangs -- was stopped at a barricade outside a vegetable market in Patiala district , KBS Sidhu , a senior state government official , told CNN . 
When police asked the men for valid travel passes , one of them took out a sword and cut off Singh 's hand . 
The injured officers , one with sword wounds to his back , were taken to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh . 
Following an hour long operation at a local gurdwara ( Sikh temple ) , police arrested the seven accused men . 
A further investigation is underway . 
India is currently under a nationwide lockdown due to end April 14 . 
Punjab , however , was one of the first states in the country to extend the measures until the end of the month . 
The state has reported a total of 151 confirmed coronavirus cases , including 11 deaths .
