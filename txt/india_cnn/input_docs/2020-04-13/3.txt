Indian Railways transported 20 liters of camel milk to a needy family on Saturday after a Mumbai resident tweeted at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for help . 
" Sir , I have a 3.5 yrs old child suffering from autism and severe food allergies . 
He survives on Camel Milk and limited qty of pulses . 
When lockdown started I did not have enough camel milk to last this long . 
Help me get Camel Milk or its powder from Sadri ( Rajasthan ) , " tweeted Neha Kumari , a resident of Mumbai earlier last week . 
Modi did not respond but transportation companies across India sprang into action . 
" I came across a tweet from a distressed mother and reached out to officials from the western Indian state of Rajasthan and Indian Railways for help , " said Arun Bothra , chief managing director ( CMD ) of Odisha State Road Transport Corporation . 
The company offered its own camel milk powder for the child . 
However , sending it to Mumbai was an issue and so he got in touch with Tarun Jain , chief passenger transport manager , North Western Indian Railways , for further assistance . 
The milk container reached the family on Saturday , Bothra said .
