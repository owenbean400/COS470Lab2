" ( The earlier order ) has been amended to change the export policy of hydroxychloroquine API and its formulations from " Prohibited " to " Free " with immediate effect , " the notification said . 
In March India had banned the export of the drug with some exceptions , followed by a blanket ban in April . 
The announcement comes after the US Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization for use of the drug to treat Covid 19 patients this week , saying there was no reason to believe the drug is effective against the virus , and that it " increased the risk of side effects , including heart problems . " 
Meanwhile , the World Health Organization said the hydroxychloroquine arm of the agency 's Covid 19 Solidarity Trial will end because the drug did not help coronavirus patients .
