Coronavirus patients were among more than 100,000 people evacuated from low lying coastal areas in India 's western states as a cyclone advanced toward Mumbai in Maharashtra today . 
Cyclone Nisarga made landfall at around 1 p.m . local time ( 3:30 a.m . ET ) with wind speeds of up to 110 kph ( 68 mph ) , according to the Indian Meteorological Department ( IMD ) . 
The cyclone , which formed in the Arabian sea on Tuesday morning , hit Alibag town , south of Mumbai . 
Cyclones in that part of the country are relatively rare -- Mumbai , India 's financial center and home to 18 million people , was last hit by a major storm in 1948 . 
The arrival of Cyclone Nisarga today comes as Maharashtra grapples with India 's worst coronavirus outbreak . 
Hospitals are struggling to treat an influx of patients as the confirmed number of cases in that state passes 72,300 , with more than 2,400 deaths . 
Ahead of landfall , the cyclone strengthened to the equivalent of just below a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane , or a Severe Cyclonic Storm in the West Pacific .
