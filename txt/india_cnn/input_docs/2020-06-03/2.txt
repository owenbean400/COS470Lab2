A cyclone is expected to make landfall near Alibag in the Indian state of Maharashtra -- a region already reeling from the impact of coronavirus -- on Wednesday afternoon , according to the India Meteorological Department . 
Maharashtra has been hit harder by Covid 19 than any other state in India . 
A total of 72,300 cases and 2,465 virus related deaths have been reported there , and the storm poses a fresh challenge to authorities attempting to enforce social distancing rules . 
The department said that Cyclone Nisarga will cross north Maharashtra , including the city of Mumbai -- home to more than 18 million people -- and the adjoining state of Gujarat 's coast in western India . 
The eye of the storm is about 65 km ( 40 miles ) in diameter as observed through radar , and the wind speed was 90 to 100 kph ( 56 to 62 mph ) , gusting to 110 kph ( 68 mph ) , on Wednesday morning local time , according to the department . 
More than 60,000 people from Maharashtra â€™s coastal districts , including Mumbai , and over 50,000 people living in low lying areas along the coast of southern Gujarat have been evacuated , according to authorities . 
India 's National Disaster Response Force has deployed 20 teams in Maharashtra , 16 teams in Gujarat and two teams in the Union Territory of Daman and Diu . 
At least 90 people were killed and thousands more left homeless after Cyclone Amphan slammed into coastal towns and cities in India and Bangladesh last month . 
Amphan was the most powerful cyclone ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal , but it weakened before making landfall .
