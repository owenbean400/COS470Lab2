The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has sparked controversy after migrant workers , returning home during a nationwide coronavirus lockdown , were doused in bleach disinfectant used to sanitize buses . 
Video showed three people , dressed in protective gear , spraying the liquid directly on a group of workers as they sat on the ground in the northern city of Bareilly . 
Ashok Gautam , a senior officer in charge of Covid 19 operations in Uttar Pradesh , told CNN as many as 5,000 people were " publicly sprayed " when they arrived before they were allowed to disperse . 
He said the disinfectant used was a solution made from bleaching powder , and was not harmful to the human body . 
While chemical disinfectants work on surfaces , they can be dangerous to people . 
And according to the World Health Organization , putting disinfectant on your skin will not kill the virus if it is already in your body . 
How India responded : The chemical wash has appalled many in India . 
Lav Agarwal , senior official at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , said Monday that local officials involved in the incident have been " reprimanded , " adding that spraying migrant workers was not a " required " policy in the country . 
The district magistrate of Bareilly , Nitish Kumar , also tweeted that while the municipal corporation and local fire service were under orders to sanitize buses , they were " overzealous " in spraying the migrant workers directly .
