The facilities are located at the Sector 16 Cricket Stadium and the Manimajra sports complex in the city of Chandigarh . 
They have been operational since March 24 , and authorities say a total of 600 people have been detained so far . 
" We round up people we find loitering on the street who are violating the lockdown conditions and bring them to the jail to brief them about social distancing , we provide them with food and tell them about proper sanitization , and they are let go by evening , " said Chandrajit Singh , Chandigarh Police 's public relations officer . 
The police force has also been briefed to maintain social distancing measures while detaining those who violate the lockdown , Singh added .

The jails will be operational as long as lockdown conditions are in place , he added .
