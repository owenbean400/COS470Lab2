India reported 2,293 new cases of coronavirus today -- its biggest single day increase since the outbreak began , according to the country 's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare . 
That takes the national total to 37,336 cases and 1,218 related deaths , according to the ministry . 
All 1.3 billion people in India remain under lockdown . 
State borders are closed , transportation is suspended , businesses are closed , and people are ordered to stay home . 
The lockdown , which left thousands of people stranded away from their home states , was supposed to lift tomorrow . 
However it has since been extended for another two weeks , although restrictions will be loosened in some low risk areas . 
This post has been updated to correct the total number of cases in India .
