Around 17,600 inmates in the western Indian state of Maharashtra will be temporarily released from prison in an attempt to control the spread of Covid 19 . 
A special committee ordered the release of the group , which accounts for half of the state â€™s prison population . 
Prisoners convicted of less serious crimes , or those awaiting trial for them , will be released after submitting a parole request . 
Inmates convicted of more serious offences , such as money laundering , organized crime , and drug trafficking will not be eligible under the scheme . 
Maharashtra 's decision comes after India 's Supreme Court directed all states to form " High Powered Committees " to consider the release of prisoners . 
The committee can " determine which class/category of the prisoners can be released on interim bail or parole depending not only upon the severity of the offence , but also the nature of offence or any other relevant factor , " the court 's order said . 
Maharashtra has the highest number of confirmed Covid 19 cases in India , with 23,401 recorded cases and 868 deaths .
