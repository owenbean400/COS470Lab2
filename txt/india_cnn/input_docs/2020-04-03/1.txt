Doctors in India fighting the virus have been subject to danger and discrimination , as some in the public fear health care workers could themselves bring the virus into their communities and contribute to its spread . 
The incident took place Wednesday , when two doctors and three community health workers were attacked in the city of Indore . 
Katdare said the team only sustained minor leg injuries . 
The team eventually returned to the same area Thursday to continue screening for coronavirus . 
Arrests made : Four people have been arrested , local police said . 
Harinarayanchari Mishra , the deputy inspector general of Indore police said at a news conference Thursday that authorities are taking the incident " very seriously " and plan to make more arrests . 
" The remaining are being identified through video footage , we will take action against them , " he said . 
The accused have been booked for assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty and obstructing a public servant in discharge of functions , Mishra said . 
A growing problem : Government officials and allies of medical workers have called upon citizens to stop attacking the very people who have dedicated their lives to saving others . 
Medical staff in New Delhi say they have been ostracized and discriminated against by their communities due to fears that they may be infected after working with coronavirus patients .
