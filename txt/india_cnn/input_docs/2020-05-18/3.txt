A powerful cyclone that formed in the Bay of Bengal is headed directly for the India Bangladesh border , bringing with it the potential for major destruction and upheaval in two countries that are still battling the Covid 19 pandemic . 
Cyclone Amphan has strengthened to the equivalent of a strong Category 4 Atlantic hurricane , or a super typhoon in the West Pacific . 
Amphan is packing winds of 150 mph ( 240 kph ) , though forecasters expect the storm will weaken before making landfall late Wednesday near the Ganges River Delta . 
Even if the storm hits after weakening , it could cause significant damage . 
Amphan is forecast to make landfall near poor , densely populated areas with notoriously unreliable infrastructure . 
If it lands in the low lying delta , there is also the potential for major storm surges , perhaps even as high as 30 feet ( 9 meters ) . 
Natural disasters are tragically common in this part of the world , but this could be the first powerful storm ever to hit India and Bangladesh amid a global health emergency .
