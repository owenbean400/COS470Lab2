He urged the international community to " learn lessons " to determine whether the WHO ’s mandate and powers need to be strengthened . 
He stated that Australia supports an impartial and comprehensive review into the global response to the outbreak . 
Meanwhile , speaking at the virtual assembly , UK ’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK supports an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus " at the appropriate point . " 
" For now we must all remain focussed on the fight against the virus , and of course a vaccine will be our best weapon in this fight , " Hancock said . 
Some background : More than 100 countries have proposed a draft resolution calling for an independent " evaluation " into the coronavirus pandemic . 
The motion comes with international support from countries such as India , New Zealand , Russian Federation , the European Union and its member states , as well as the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland . 
The United States is not one of the signatories . 
The draft does not specifically mention China or Beijing , but China has been facing mounting international scrutiny for its initial handling of the COVID 19 outbreak .
