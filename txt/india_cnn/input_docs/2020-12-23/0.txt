The Serum Institute of India ( SII ) has submitted additional data to Indian regulators for the Covid 19 vaccine developed by Astra Zeneca and Oxford University and is waiting for the government to make a decision , a source has told CNN . 
India ’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation ( CDSCO ) had requested more data from SII earlier this month as it continues to analyze applications submitted for emergency use authorization for a Covid 19 vaccine . 
The source says SII has submitted all the data required for the authorization for the emergency approval to the Indian regulators . 
" We have submitted everything they have asked for … The announcement of rollout of the vaccine will be the government ’s call , " said the source , who is not permitted to speak on ongoing approvals and was granted anonymity by CNN . 
At the weekly press briefing Tuesday , officials announced that three applications from Pfizer , Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech are pending before the Drugs Controller General of India -- the main regulatory body . 
" Pfizer has not yet submitted data . 
The other two companies have presented the data and the regulator sought additional data . 
This is a normal process . "
