The Indian city of Mumbai is preparing for the arrival of about 26,000 passengers , mostly Indian nationals , who are expected to return from Gulf countries over the next two weeks . 
More than 20 flights a day arrive in Mumbai from Gulf nations like the UAE , Kuwait , Qatar and Oman . 
Yesterday , the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs passed an order that all passengers coming from or transiting through those countries will be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival , either at government facilities or at home . 
Most of the travelers are Indian blue collar workers on labor contracts in the Gulf countries , who are now returning home . 
Arrivals who are asymptomatic and have homes in Mumbai can go home and self isolate for 14 days . 
If they live in neighboring towns , they can still stay at home but are not allowed to take public transport . 
If they show symptoms , or live far from Mumbai , they will be quarantined in government facilities , said municipal government officials . 
Quarantine centers : One quarantine site is the Seven Hills Hospital in the Marol area of Mumbai -- but the city has also set up other quarantine facilities and a portal in partnership with hotels and marriage halls . 
The government quarantine facilities have about 700 beds available , said P Velrasu , Additional Municipal Commissioner . 
Mumbai currently has 45 cases of the coronavirus , according to the state 's Ministry of Public Health and Family Welfare . 
India has 169 cases in total , and three deaths , according to Johns Hopkins University , which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources .
