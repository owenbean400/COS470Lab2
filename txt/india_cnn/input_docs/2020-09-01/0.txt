India is entering a new phase of reopening that will see subway trains running for the first time in months , despite skyrocketing daily coronavirus infections that are showing no sign of slowing down . 
The country of 1.3 billion people has reported more than 75,000 infections for five consecutive days -- the fastest growing caseload of any country in the world . 
India 's infection rate has increased exponentially in recent weeks . 
It took almost six months for the country to record 1 million cases , another three weeks to hit 2 million , and only 16 more days to hit 3 million . 
At this rate , India 's total number of cases , now at over 3.6 million , is on track to outnumber that of Brazil to become the second highest in the world , behind the US . 
But India 's death toll remains relatively low compared to its infection numbers . 
As of Sunday , India reported 64,469 coronavirus deaths -- about half of Brazil 's death toll -- with a mortality rate of 1.79 % , according to its Health Ministry . 
As infections soar , the Indian government has continued to lift lockdown measures . 
On Saturday , the Ministry of Home Affairs announced India will enter a new phase of reopening on September 1 known as " unlock 4 . " 
That includes the resumption of the country 's metro rail services in a " graded manner " from September 7 , according to the ministry 's statement . 
Under the new rules , gatherings of up to 100 people will be permitted at sports , entertainment , cultural , religious and political events outside of hot spot areas from September 21 , with mandatory face mask wearing and social distancing measures . 
Schools and colleges will remain closed until the end of September , although up to 50 % of the teaching staff will be allowed to return to campus to teach online courses , and students from Year 9 to 12 can also return on a voluntary basis .
