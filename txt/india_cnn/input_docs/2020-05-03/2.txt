Eighteen laborers crammed inside a concrete mixer in a desperate attempt to evade India 's nationwide lockdown and travel home , police said . 
They were found in the machine when the truck carrying the cement mixer was pulled over by police in the state of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday . 
The workers were traveling from Mumbai , in western India , to their homes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh , said Choudhary -- a distance of more than 1,300 kilometers ( about 800 miles ) . 
Police said they impounded the truck and the laborers were sent to a quarantine centre in Indore . 
A formal complaint was filed by police . 
India 's nationwide lockdown has been in effect since March 24 and on Friday was extended by two more weeks until May 17 , although exemptions have been issued for certain areas and activities .
