Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologized for a nationwide lockdown during his monthly radio address to the nation on Sunday morning . 
" Let me seek forgiveness from all the countrymen . 
My conscience tells me that you will definitely forgive me as I had to take certain decisions which have put you in a lot of difficulty , " Modi said . 
Modi ordered the 21 day complete lockdown on March 24 in an effort to fight the coronavirus from spreading . 
All nonessential establishments , including shops , factories , and places of worship , are required to remain closed throughout the lockdown . 
The decision left tens of thousands of India 's migrant laborers scrambling to return to their hometowns , as they no longer had a means of income in India . 
In his radio address , Modi asked poor Indians for their forgiveness . 
" Especially when I look at my poor brothers and sisters , I definitely feel that they must be thinking , what kind of prime minister is this who has placed us in this difficulty ? 
I especially seek their forgiveness , " Modi said . 
" I understand your troubles but there was no other way to wage a war against corona for a country like India with a population of 1.3 billion . 
It is a battle of life and death and we have to win it , therefore , such strong measures were absolutely necessary . 
Nobody likes to take such strong measures , however , looking at the situation all over the world , it seems this is the only option , " Modi said .
