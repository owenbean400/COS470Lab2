Hundreds of thousands of migrant laborers in India have potentially lost their jobs and livelihoods as construction sites and factories close amid a countrywide lockdown . 
There were concerns in recent days that without a reliable job , thousands of these laborers would head back to their hometowns on food -- potentially undermining the lockdown . 
Now the local governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have arranged buses for migrant laborers to head home despite fears of the coronavirus . 
A tweet from the office of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath , released Saturday evening , said 1,000 public and private buses had been deployed . 
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal confirmed on Saturday on his official Twitter account that buses have been arranged but urged people to stay home . 
" Please stay in your home . 
Do not go to your village . 
Otherwise , the lockdown serves no purpose , " Kejriwal said .
