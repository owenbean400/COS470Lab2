Nineteen people have tested positive for Covid 19 in relief camps set up for people who escaped heavy flooding this month in the southern Indian state of Telangana . 
The percentage of those testing positive appears to be low , however . 
Etala Rajender , Telangana 's health minister , said Sunday that 2,000 refugees had been tested . 
The camps are currently home to thousands of people who lost their homes or were displaced by the inundation , which killed at least 70 people .

However , authorities have taken precautions to stop others from contracting Covid 19 , said Somesh Kumar , a senior state government official .
