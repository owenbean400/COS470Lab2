The UK Government is looking at options to reduce the 14 day quarantine period for travelers entering the country to around one week , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday . 
" It 's one of the things we ’d like to bring in as soon as it 's practical to do it , " he told LBC Radio on Monday . 
Visitors arriving in the UK from certain countries are required to self isolate for 14 days -- though the exact restrictions differ in England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . 
" I think everybody understands how important the quarantine policy is . 
When we brought it in , there was a lot of noise , a lot of people saying this was not necessary , " Hancock said . 
" But sadly if you look at the number of cases in India , Brazil , and now closer to home – in Spain and in France – people can see why we ’ve had to bring that policy in . " 
Asked about the importance of reducing quarantine to help tourism , he said his focus was on working out a way to do so " safely , and that works , and that protects people in this country . "
