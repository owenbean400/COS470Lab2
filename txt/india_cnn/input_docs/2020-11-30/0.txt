India is preparing to distribute " hundreds of millions of doses " of coronavirus vaccines in the first and second quarters of 2021 , according to Serum Institute of India ( SII ) CEO Adar Poonawala . 
Poonawala said at a press conference Saturday that the SII will produce and distribute Covishield , the vaccine developed by Oxford University and Astra Zeneca . 
The world 's largest vaccine producer will apply for an emergency use license from India 's drug authority in the next two weeks . 
On Saturday , Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured SII 's vaccine manufacturing facilities in three Indian cities to get a " first hand perspective of the preparations , challenges , and roadmap in India 's endeavour to vaccinate its citizens , " according to a government press release . 
Poonawalla said that India had adequate cold storage facilities to store Covishield at the required temperature . 
While India 's government has not placed an official purchase order for the vaccine , SII estimates that it could buy between 300 million and 400 million doses by next July . 
" We are trying to get to that target , " Poonawalla added .
