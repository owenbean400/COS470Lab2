A pregnant woman traveling through India by foot interrupted her journey to give birth and then kept walking for another 160 kilometers ( 99 miles ) with her newborn baby . 
The woman , whose identity is unknown to CNN , was walking with her husband and their four other children from the city of Nashik , in Maharashtra , to the town of Satna in the adjoining state of Madhya Pradesh . 
The family had left Nashik because they had no place to live and the country 's coronavirus lockdown had left them without any means to earn money , according to Kavita Kanesh , an official in Madhya Pradesh . 
Somewhere along the trip , the woman stopped and gave birth to a baby girl . 
A few days later , she was stopped by Kanesh at a checkpoint in their home state . 
The baby was born on May 5 , four days before they reached the checkpoint , Kanesh said . 
Kanesh said she arranged for the woman to be taken to a quarantine facility and receive medical treatment . 
Thousands of migrant workers have attempted to leave Indian cities and return to their villages since the country 's coronavirus restrictions came into effect . 
Due to widespread closures of public transport , some have been forced to make the journeys on foot . 
India has so far recorded more than 78,000 coronavirus cases and 2,551 deaths , according to data compiled by John Hopkins University .
