Dozens of pregnant women were put in quarantine in India after coming into contact with a sonographer who tested positive for coronavirus , according to a senior district official . 
The sonographer , who tested positive on April 14 , lives in Pune in the western state of Maharashtra and traveled to rural areas to offer his services at several health camps . 
While he was volunteering at a gynaecology clinic in Shikrapur village from April 6 to April 8 , he met with 69 pregnant women . 
A further 75 people had been to the clinic during that period , but they were not patients and did not come in direct contact with him , said Ayush Prasad , chief executive officer of the district council . 
Of the remaining high risk contacts , two women have already delivered babies and one had been admitted to the hospital in labor at the time of speaking , Prasad said . 
The sonographer was not exhibiting coronavirus symptoms when he attended the clinic and was wearing a mask , Prasad added . 
The 62 women were tested for coronavirus and found to be negative , according to Prasad . 
Once the test results came back , the women were moved from the hotels and are now self isolating at home . 
" There is not even an iota of doubt but we have still advised the women to be in social isolation in their homes for 14 days , " he said .
