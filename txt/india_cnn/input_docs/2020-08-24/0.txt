India 's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has released fresh guidelines for the entertainment industry after all productions were ended in March due to the pandemic . 
The new standard operating procedure ( SOP ) is expected to ensure the safety of the cast and crew in both television and movie productions , which may resume as India has slowly lifted restrictions over the past three months . 
" The SOP ensures adequate distancing at shoot locations and other workplaces and contains measures including proper sanitization , crowd management and provision for protective equipment , " tweeted cabinet minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday . 
Face masks , hand sanitizer , thermal screening and social distancing are among the new measures . 
Production companies have been asked to keep the cast and crew at a minimum and coordinate crowds that may gather during an outdoor shoot . 
" The SOP follows international norms . 
This will help give a fillip to the industry which has been affected due to coronavirus for close to six months now and people will welcome this move by the Ministry , " said Javadekar .
