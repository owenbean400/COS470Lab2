India â€™s Upper House of Parliament , the Rajya Sabha , has adjourned indefinitely , a week ahead of schedule , in light of the rising number of Covid 19 cases across the country . 
" I have to inform the members that the government has decided to recommend the adjournment of the House sine die today . 
But some important legislative business passed by the Lok Sabha must be disposed of before adjournment of the House sine die [ indefinitely ] , " Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs V . Muraleedharan informed the Upper House . 
" This August house had to function from six different locations , including chambers of both the houses , four galleries of the house , the first of its kind in the history of Rajya Sabha . 
In another first , we functioned on Saturday and Sunday of the last week , without taking the usual break , " he added . 
Several opposition parties are currently boycotting the house and the benches were empty as the Upper House passed the Foreign Contribution ( Regulation ) Amendment Bill , the Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Bill , the three labor codes , and the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill on the last day . 
The sudden conclusion of the Monsoon Session , which began on September 14 and is due to end on October 1 , comes amid an uproar over the government 's farm bills , which were passed on Sunday . 
Eight opposition Rajya Sabha MPs were suspended for unruly behavior , which triggered the boycott by opposition parties in proceedings in both the upper and lower houses , demanding the suspension be revoked . 
The Lower House , or Lok Sabha , will meet at 3 p.m . local time and is also likely to be adjourned .
