India 's Serum Institute , the world 's largest vaccine manufacturer , says it will take until 2024 for the whole world to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus . 
Poonawalla said some of the challenges of getting vaccines from the point of research and approval to administering them to patients include scaling up manufacturing of the vaccines and raising billions of dollars to fund procurement of the necessary doses . 
He said administering the vaccines in certain complex geographies and countries is also a challenge . 
The Serum Institute of India is working with five Covid 19 vaccine developers and is gearing up to make hundreds of millions of doses . 
But even then , the vaccine supply will only go so far in the short term . 
Take India , for example , with a population of 1.4 billion . 
" By July , August next year , even if we were to produce 400 million does , they 're still going to struggle to vaccinate everyone using those doses , " Poonawalla said .
