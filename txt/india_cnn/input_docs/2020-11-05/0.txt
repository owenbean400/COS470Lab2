Australia has secured another 50 million doses of Covid 19 vaccines , bringing the country â€™s total purchase to more than 134 million doses , Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced in a press release on Thursday . 
Forty million of the new doses will be supplied by Novavax , while Pfizer and Bio NTech will supply 10 million doses , he said . 
Prime Minister Morrison said investing in different vaccines will be crucial to ensure the country gains early access to a vaccine . 
" We are not putting all our eggs in one basket and we will continue to pursue further vaccines should our medical experts recommend them , " he added . 
Supply deals between countries and vaccine makers have so far favored developed countries and territories including Australia , the UK , US , Hong Kong , Macau , Japan , Switzerland and Israel , as well as the European Union . 
Developing countries including India , Bangladesh , China , Brazil , Indonesia and Mexico have also secured vaccine deals , but the Serum Institute of India ( SII ) recently predicted it will take four to five years for the vaccine to reach everyone around the globe .
