Four Indian police officers were arrested Wednesday for allegedly murdering a father and son who were in custody after being accused of breaking coronavirus restrictions . 
A fifth police officer is set to be arrested today , said K Shankar , a senior police officer of the Criminal Investigation Department in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu , where the alleged murders occurred . 
The deaths of the pair last month renewed outrage in India over police brutality , with the men 's family members , politicians and human rights activists alleging officers tortured the pair before they died . 
On Tuesday , Tamil Nadu 's highest court said there was enough evidence to charge the police officers involved in the case with murder , based on the victims ' injuries and formal statements . 
CNN has tried multiple times to contact local police for comment on the allegations . 
The initial police report notes that the men sustained their injuries during arrest . 
The officers have not commented publicly on the allegations . 
In a statement Monday , non profit Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative said the case showed the need for India to enact a strong law to prohibit and prosecute police torture and custodial death .
