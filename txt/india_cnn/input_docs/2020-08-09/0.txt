India â€™s junior minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Heavy Industries , Arjun Ram Meghwal , has tested positive for coronavirus just weeks after promoting a brand of spiced snack called " Bahabhi Ji " papad , which he claimed could ward off the deadly virus . 
A video of Meghwal went viral on social media last month where he can be seen holding a packet of the papad product -- a thin , crispy , round flatbread -- made with ingredients such as turmeric , black pepper , cumin and salt . 
In the video , he claimed it helped as an immunity booster against coronavirus . 
Meghwal 's unscientific and bizarre claims were ridiculed by many on Indian social media , with one post jokingly saying , " I have started eating Bahabhi Ji papad , now I do not need a vaccine . " 
As of Sunday morning , India has a total of 2,153,010 coronavirus cases including 43,379 deaths , according to the country 's health ministry .
