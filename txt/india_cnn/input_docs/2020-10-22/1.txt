The coronavirus pandemic is causing " unacceptable " shortages of US drug supplies in the United States , according to a report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy ( CIDRAP ) at the University of Minnesota . 
The report says shortages have limited 29 of 40 drugs critical for treating Covid 19 patients , including propofol , albuterol , midazolam , hydroxychloroquine , fentanyl , azithromycin and morphine , according to the American Society of Health System Pharmacists , while the FDA , which has more stringent criteria for shortages , show 18 of 40 are on the drug shortage list . 
Another 67 out of 156 critical acute drugs are in short supply , the report said , including diazepam , phenobarbital , lidocaine and acetaminophen . 
" Drug shortages can be a matter of life and death , and some shortages mean that a life saving drug is not available to U.S . patients at any price , " the authors wrote . 
" This , in turn , will dramatically increase the need for specific COVID 19 treatment drugs , while at the same , COVID 19 is having a major impact on two of the three key drug manufacturing areas of the world , India and Italy , " Osterholm added . 
The pandemic has " jolted the global pharmaceutical market at all levels and production points " and exacerbated a problem that dates back several decades , researchers said . 
Closed factories , shipping delays or shutdowns and trade limitations or export bans have severely impacted the supply side of the chain , the analysis concluded , while the pandemic has caused a dramatic increase in the global demand for Covid 19 therapies . 
The report also suggests recommendations for combatting drug shortages , including creating a new federal entity to track , analyze , predict , prevent and mitigate drug
