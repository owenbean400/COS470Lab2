Fifteen migrant laborers in India were run over and killed by a train on Friday as they tried to make their way home during a nationwide coronavirus lockdown , authorities said . 
Arun Kumar , the director general of India 's Railway Protection Force , said the victims were walking to a station in the state of Maharashtra . 
They had been sleeping on the tracks before they were hit by a goods train shortly after 5 a.m . Four others who were hit survived , two of whom are in critical condition . 
It 's common for people to cross train tracks in India even when trains are running , but it 's unclear why the laborers were sleeping on them . 
Kumar said it 's possible that the laborers may have walked along railway tracks to avoid the main road in order to get around police checkpoints , as cross border travel is not permitted under the lockdown and they would have been made to turn around . 
No passengers trains are currently running between states . 
The laborers worked in an iron factory in Jalna district of Aurangabad in Maharashtra state , Kumar said . 
He believes they were likely trying to get on a train that was going to their home state of Madhya Pradesh . 
Lockdown measures differ from state to state in India , but throughout the country thousands of migrant workers found themselves stranded with no job , no income , and no mode of transportation to get home when the restrictions went into effect six weeks ago . Authorities had organized special trains and buses so that they could get home , but those are only open to laborers who the government has identified and is allowing to return to their homes . 
There are only a limited number of seats available on these trains because authorities want passengers to maintain adequate distance between each other .
