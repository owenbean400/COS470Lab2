A 12 year old girl in India , who embarked on a 200 mile journey home on foot during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown , died just an hour away from her house , according to local officials . 
Jamlo Madkam worked in chili fields in Perur village , in the southern state of Telangana . 
The nationwide lockdown was supposed to end on April 14 -- but was extended until May . 
On April 15 , Madkam and 11 others , including her brother in law , began the journey to their home state of Chattisgarh in central India . 
They decided to walk home because they were out of work , and were not sure when the lockdown would end , said Dr B R Pujari , the chief medical health officer of Madkam 's home district . 
Three days later , she died before she could make it home . 
The remaining 11 migrant workers have been quarantined at a government facility for 14 days , and their samples have been sent for testing . 
Madkam 's postmortem report showed that she did not have coronavirus . 
The nationwide lockdown has been in place since March 25 , and will continue through May 3 . 
Once the lockdown came into effect , thousands of workers attempted to walk home as they were left without work and a means of transport to travel back home .
