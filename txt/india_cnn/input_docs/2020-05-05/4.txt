Migrant workers clashed with local police in two Indian states on Monday as frustration grows under lockdown restrictions . 
In the city of Surat in Gujarat state , around 4,000 migrant workers -- mostly from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- had gathered and were demanding that they be sent back home , said Ashok Munia , a senior Surat police official . 
The protest turned violent after local police were unable to pacify the crowd . 
They threw stones at police and were burning tires in the street , added Munia . 
Police used tear gas on the crowd and beat them back with batons in an attempt to control the situation . 
In Bengaluru in the state of Karnataka , 1,200 migrant workers , primarily from the states of Bihar and Odisha , gathered on the outskirts of the city demanding trains be arranged to send them home , police sub inspector , Y Mudharaja , said . 
" They were striking and when we tried to calm them down they started pelting stones , I was hit on the head as well , " Mudharaja said . 
The police commissioner and the state revenue minister arrived at the spot and addressed the workers after which they finally agreed to disperse , Mudharaja added .
