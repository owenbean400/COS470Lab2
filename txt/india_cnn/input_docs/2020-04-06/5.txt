Dr . Randeep Guleria , director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi says that the most important way to stop a coronavirus outbreak in India 's slums will be to get community participation . 
" In my mind the control of the disease is going to be through the community rather than through the hospitals , " Guleria said , speaking to CNN on Monday . 
Efforts to stop the coronavirus from spreading in Mumbai 's densely populated Dharavi slum are being ramped up after several cases and one death were confirmed there last week . 
Quarantining not possible in a slum : Guleria said it is impossible for people there to isolate themselves at home .

On whether the country has enough hospital resources to cope with a large outbreak , Guleria said that while resources " are going to be strained , " India has had a few weeks to prepare .
