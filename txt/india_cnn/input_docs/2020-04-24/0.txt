Hafiz Mohammed Naseerudin says that after a police officer assaulted him for being a Muslim and blamed him for spreading the coronavirus , he was left lying on the road for almost an hour . 
Naseerudin , 44 , had gone to pick up some vegetables from his friend 's house in Humnabad , in the southern Indian state of Karnataka , when he says an officer stopped him on his scooter . 
Other vehicles were on the road , Naseerudin says -- he believes he was stopped because of his religion . 
Nagesh D L , police superintendent of Bidar district where Humnabad is located , says the officer has been suspended while an inquiry was conducted into the incident . 
Naseerudin says he called the police from hospital to make a statement , but Nagesh claims they did not receive any complaint . 
Naseerudin is not alone : As fears over the coronavirus mount in India , some Muslims , who make up roughly 200 million of the country 's 1.3 billion population , have been targeted in Islamophobic attacks and accused of spreading the virus . 
In the capital New Delhi , volunteers distributing ration kits to Muslim families say they face harassment from police and are scared to go out . 
In Punjab , Muslim milk producers say they have been threatened by villagers , their houses have been raided by police , and people are scared to buy their produce . 
While these incidents have been mostly isolated , the virus fears are only amplifying existing prejudices , playing into growing Hindu nationalism which in recent years has seen India 's Muslim societies increasingly marginalized .
