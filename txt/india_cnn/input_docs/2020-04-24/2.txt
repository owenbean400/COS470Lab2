Last week , a mother in India infected with Covid 19 gave birth to a baby girl . 
The mother had to be kept in isolation , and saw her baby for the first time after delivery via video conferencing . 
The baby was born in Aurangabad , a city in the western state of Maharashtra . 
When the family arrived at the hospital , the mother and her two sons tested positive for coronavirus , but her husband tested negative , according to Dr . Sundar Kulkarni , a surgeon at Aurangabad Civil Hospital . 
The mother had gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism , making the birth a " challenge , " said Kulkarni -- but " when we delivered a healthy baby it was quite a memorable moment for us . " 
Nurses have been using a breast pump to extract the mother 's milk and feeding it to the baby . 
The family can be reunited after the mother tests negative for two consecutive days .
