The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has suspended the 2020 edition of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) until further notice due to the evolving Coronavirus pandemic . 
The lucrative eight team T20 cricket tournament was scheduled to begin in India on March 29 and end on May 24 . 
Some context : This is the second time the BCCI has been forced to defer the tournament . 
Last month , just before the Indian government put the country in a three week lockdown , the board pushed the start date to Wednesday 15 April . 
" The health and safety of the nation and everyone involved in our great sport remains our top priority and as such , the BCCI along with the Franchise Owners , Broadcaster , Sponsors and all the Stakeholders acknowledge that the IPL 2020 season will only commence when it is safe and appropriate to do so , " BCCI secretary , Jay Shah , said in a statement on Thursday . 
On Tuesday , Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the nationwide lockdown until May 3 .
