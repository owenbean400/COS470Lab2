Polamma carefully descends the 250 steps from the hilltop slum where she lives in southern India to walk one kilometer to the nearest grocery store . 
She is nine months pregnant and has four children to feed , but at the bottom of the steps community leaders of a dominant caste force her to go back empty handed . 
Since India went into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus on March 25 , 57 families who live in Polamma 's hilltop village in Vijayawada , Andhra Pradesh , have been barred from going down the hill , even to purchase essentials such as food and medicine . 
The families are part of the Yanadi community , who work mainly as waste pickers and drain cleaners and who -- even before the coronavirus -- were segregated because of their caste . 
The background : India 's caste system was officially abolished in 1950 , but the 2,000 year old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life . 
The caste system categorizes Hindus at birth , defining their place in society , what jobs they can do and who they can marry . 
Those at the bottom of the hierarchy , who fall outside the four main categories of Brahmins ( priests and teachers ) , Kshatriyas ( warriors and rulers ) , Vaishyas ( traders and merchants ) and the Shudras ( laborers ) , are considered " untouchables " or Dalits . 
Millions of people , about 25 % of India 's population of 1.3 billion people , are grouped under the scheduled castes ( Dalits ) and scheduled tribes ( Adivasis ) in India 's constitution . 
Adivasis are indigenous Indians who have been socially and economically marginalized for centuries . 
Both groups have long endured social isolation , but it 's feared the rapid spread of the coronavirus and measures to stop it have worsened their segregation .
