She 's racing to beat the midday heat and a government issued deadline to visit 30 to 40 households before noon . 
Wearing a standard issue pink jacket and a homemade cloth mask , she goes door to door , checking for cases of Covid 19 . 
Pawar is one of more than a million Accredited Social Health Activists -- or ASHA workers -- Indian women who act as a liaison between people and the public health care system in rural areas . 
It 's considered the largest community health worker program in the world .
