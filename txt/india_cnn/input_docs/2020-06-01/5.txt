The chief minister of Delhi , Arvind Kejriwal , said India 's capital territory will seal its borders for the next week to stop the spread of novel coronavirus . 
However , Kejriwal said the new restriction would not stop the movement of essential goods and services across the city 's borders . 
All shops across the city will be allowed to open every day , but a curfew will be in place from 9 p.m . to 5 a.m . in accordance with guidelines issued by the Indian government . 
All industries will be allowed to operate , but with a staggered workforce . 
Kejriwal also said that hair salons and barbers will be allowed to operate but spas will not reopen yet . 
The government has also removed restrictions on public and private transport and on the number of passengers who can travel in a car or autorickshaw . 
States adjoining New Delhi will continue to only allow minimal movement across their borders , but government officials will be able to travel so long as they present proper identification .
