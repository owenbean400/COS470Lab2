Today , India is attempting the world â€™s biggest social distancing exercise . 
But for now , it will only last for 14 hours . 
Why is it happening ? 
It 's the latest attempt by the government to stall the rapid spread of Covid 19 . 
It could also indicate that the government is testing the waters on whether an official curfew could actually be imposed across the country . 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has kept up a steady stream of tweets since early morning , asking citizens to stay inside . 
" The steps we take now will help in the times to come . 
Stay indoors and stay healthy , " he said . 
What India is like today : Social media has been flooded with photographs of famous locations that are usually packed with people -- but today are eerily quiet . 
In India , where staples like rice , flour and pulses have always been bought in bulk , the fear of a lockdown has spurred people to double their usual orders . 
Local grocery shops -- seen on every street -- continue to operate but with fewer items on their shelves . 
Modi has asked Indians to hold a salute to medical professionals , emergency health care provider and government officials on Sunday evening . 
Millions are expected to ring bells and clap to honor their work . 
Who will be affected by the ' public curfew ' : The people who will be most affected are those who depend on a steady daily wage to put food on the table -- including people who work as rickshaw pullers or street hawkers . 
This is also a problem for shoppers . 
In a country where tinned food is almost non existent , every household is dependent on the local hawkers who push carts piled with vegetables each morning through the neighborhood . 
What 's the bigger picture in India : More than 320 people have contracted coronavirus in India . 
In the past few weeks , India has taken unprecedented steps to shut down its borders , cancel visas and ban passengers from certain countries from entering Indian airspace .
