Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday that citizens should " stay indoors and stay healthy . " 
His comments came as the country 's janata curfew -- or citizens ' curfew -- began at 7 a.m . local time . 
Everyone except those in working in essential services has been asked to self isolate for the day . 
Earlier this week , Modi asked all Indians to stand on their balconies , or at their windows and doors , at 5 p.m . local time Sunday for five minutes to express their gratitude towards emergency service workers for working tirelessly during the outbreak .
