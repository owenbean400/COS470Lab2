Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , on Wednesday said that more cases had been reported to the agency in the past 24 hours than any time since the novel coronavirus pandemic began . 
Those four countries are the United States , Russia , Brazil and India , WHO infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove confirmed to CNN . 
It is important to note : There can be delays in reporting at many points in the process , so this single day high does not mean that these 106,000 people were infected , tested or counted in the past 24 hours . 
CNN relies exclusively on Johns Hopkins University for its case and death counts , but the world â€™s preeminent health agency making this announcement today is newsworthy .
