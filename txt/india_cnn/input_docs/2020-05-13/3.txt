The Indian government has announced details of a support package worth more than $ 40 billion to help small businesses affected by the Covid 19 outbreak . 
The majority of the money will go toward providing collateral free loans until October 31 , Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said today during a press conference . 
The finance minister also announced that in order to help local industries , foreign companies will be prevented from tendering for contracts worth up to $ 26.5 million . 
" This will reduce competition for local industries , " the minister said .
