Gilead Sciences , the maker of remdesivir , has reached agreements with five generic drugmakers to produce remdesivir for 127 countries . 
The move comes after growing questions over the global supply of remdesivir , which has been shown to speed the recovery of some coronavirus patients . 
Gilead signed agreements with manufacturers based in India and Pakistan , according to its website . 
The deals allow the companies to distribute the drug to mostly low income and lower middle income countries , according to Gilead , which said the companies can set their own prices . 
The manufacturers also would not have to pay royalties to Gilead for the time being , although that would change if another drug or vaccine is approved to treat or prevent Covid 19 – or if the World Health Organization declares an end to the public health emergency of international concern . 
In the US : Gilead has said it will donate its existing remdesivir supply of 1.5 million vials , enough for about 100,000 to 200,000 patients . 
At least 40 % of that is reserved for the United States , according to the US Department of Health and Human Services . 
While the company has said it hopes to produce a million treatment courses by the end of the year , it ’s unclear how that will be distributed internationally . 
In a statement , the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen said Gilead ’s licensing agreements do not go far enough . 
It noted that much of the world ’s population would not be covered by the agreements , and said Gilead should " commit its patents , data and know how to the public domain , " instead of just licensing its technology . 
About the drug : In early results from a trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health , remdesivir was found to shorten the duration of illness in patients with severe Covid 19 , but it had no statistically significant effect on whether patients died .
