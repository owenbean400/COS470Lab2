In a desperate attempt to reach home during India â€™s strict coronavirus lockdown , a man traveled more than 800 miles home disguised as an onion seller , only to be sent to quarantine by the local police after reaching his destination . 
According to police , Prem Murti Pandey , an employee at Mumbai 's airport , loaded a truck with 28 tons of onion and traveled around 1,400 kilometers ( 869 miles ) from Mumbai to his home in Prayagraj , northern India . 
So Pandey decided to rent a truck , hire a driver and disguise himself . 
" We bought the onions from a vegetable market near Mumbai , and using the excuse of produce delivery , we crossed three states to finally reach home on Friday after traveling for three days , " according to Pandey . 
India 's lockdown rules allows vehicles delivering food items to cross state borders . 
Pandey was sent to quarantine after his actions surfaced on Saturday , Arvind Kumar Singh , a senior police official in Prayagraj told CNN . 
" He has not shown any symptoms of coronavirus but he has been kept in a quarantine center as a precautionary measure for two weeks , " the police official added . 
Maharashtra -- home to India 's financial capital Mumbai -- is the worst affected state in the outbreak , with more than 28 % of the country 's coronavirus cases reported there .
