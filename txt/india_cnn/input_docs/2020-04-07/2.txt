Doctors in India are being attacked and harassed by their communities , due to fears that they may be infected after working with coronavirus patients . 
Last week , a mob in the central state of Madhya Pradesh pelted doctors with stones while they were treating a suspected coronavirus patient . 
And a doctor in the city of Surat , in the western state of Gujarat , was harassed by her neighbors on Saturday , according to a senior police official . 
" The doctor claims that the neighbors accused her of having the coronavirus and were yelling at her , but the neighbors say that they were angry because the doctor 's dog had attacked them , " said police commissioner R B Brahmabhatt . 
The neighbors were arrested on Sunday and released on bail . 
Medical staff in the capital New Delhi also say they have been ostracized and discriminated against . 
Some doctors have even reported being evicted , or faced threats that their electricity will be cut off . 
For weeks , state and federal authorities have urged the public to avoid violence or stigmatizing medical staff , and have praised frontline workers -- but the attacks have continued .
