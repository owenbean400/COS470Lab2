India has partially lifted export restrictions on the drug hydroxychloroquine , according to a statement from the country â€™s Ministry of External Affairs . 
The restrictions " have been largely lifted " after a review of national needs , ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said in the statement . 
New Delhi had imposed a blanket export ban on the drug on Saturday , just as President Donald Trump requested more to be released to the United States . 
Trump has insisted that the drug -- usually used to treat malaria -- can prevent the coronavirus , despite there being no reliable evidence and no definitive study . 
The FDA has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of Covid 19 . 
The Indian government says going forward , demand for paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine will be continuously monitored , and that the number of materials in stock could allow for companies to meet export commitments previously under contract . 
Responding to questions about the turnaround in policy , Srivastava said he discouraged speculation or any attempts to politicize the matter . 
The Indian government had initially restricted the sale and distribution of hydroxychloroquine in March , and made it eligible only to medical personnel working with confirmed Covid 19 patients or individuals who had come in close contact with a positive case .
