Children can spread coronavirus among themselves efficiently , but young adults are the primary source of coronavirus spread , according to a study published Wednesday . 
The study , based on a giant contact tracing effort involving more than 3 million people in India , shows most Covid 19 patients never infect anyone else -- the researchers found that 70 % of infected people did not infect any of their contacts . 
Instead , the study found that 8 % of patients accounted for 60 % of observed new infections . 
The study also contradicts the widely held belief that children are unlikely to catch coronavirus . 
The team wrote in their report , which was published in the journal Science , that " while the role of children in transmission has been debated , we identify high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age . " 
And that ’s despite schools being closed in India since March , Laxminarayan noted . 
The study was based on the universal contact tracing efforts undertaken in two large states in the south of India . 
Authorities tracked down and tested more than 575,000 people exposed to nearly 85,000 confirmed coronavirus cases from March until August . 
Most of the index cases – the first patient in a chain of transmission -- were adults aged 20 to 45 , the team found .
