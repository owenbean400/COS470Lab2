On Sunday , India surpassed 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus , after reporting 69,239 new infections in 24 hours , according to the ministry . 
Indian Minister for Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan said that one of the country 's Covid 19 vaccine candidates was in its third phase of clinical trial . 
" We are very confident that a vaccine will be developed by the end of this year , " the minister said on Saturday . 
" I am happy to say that in the eighth month of the battle , India has the best recovery rate of around 75 % . 
A total of 2.2 million patients have recovered and gone home and another 700,000 are going to be cured very soon . " 
In India , patients with mild and moderate symptoms are considered no longer active after 10 days of symptom onset if they meet certain conditions . 
A test to confirm that they no longer have the virus is not required . 
Severe cases can only be discharged after one negative coronavirus test .
