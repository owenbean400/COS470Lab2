You are more likely to die from Covid 19 if you live in a county in the United States with higher levels of long term air pollution , according to new research released Tuesday by the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health . 
" We found that an increase of only 1 gram per cubic meter in fine particulate matter in the air was associated with a 15 % increase in the Covid 19 death rate , " said lead author Francesca Dominici , co director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative . 
The study defined high pollution levels as fine particulate matter ( PM 2.5 ) levels above 13 micrograms per cubic meter of air , much higher than the US mean of 8.4 . While the study was focussed on the US , it could have implications for other countries , too . 
India , for instance has 21 of the world 's 30 cities with the worst air pollution . 
American Lung Association President and CEO Harold Wimmer said that the study 's findings illustrate that " far too many Americans are facing multiple threats to their lung health at once , and when taken together , these different threats to lung health impacts can amplify each other . " 
" We cannot afford to delay cleanup of dangerous air pollution , " he said . 
" In fact , it is more important than ever . "
