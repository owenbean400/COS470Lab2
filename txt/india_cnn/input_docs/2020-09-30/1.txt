More than 63 million people in India may have contracted Covid 19 , health authorities said on Tuesday -- about 10 times higher than the official reported figures . 
A national survey of more than 29,000 people across 700 villages and wards found that about one in 15 people above the age of 10 had antibodies against the coronavirus , according to the Indian Council of Medical Research . 
The survey was conducted from mid August to mid September . 
Antibody tests , also known as serology tests , check for proteins called antibodies in the immune system , which indicate if someone has been exposed to the virus . 
Of the country 's 1.3 billion citizens , more than 966 million are aged 10 or above , according to the government 's most recent census in 2011 . 
If one in 15 people of this group have been infected with Covid 19 , that 's a total of 63.78 million people . 
As of Wednesday , India has reported more than 6.1 million cases and 96,000 deaths , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . 
The survey suggests that for every one infection officially reported , there are actually 26 to 32 people infected who slip through the cracks , said Dr . Balram Bhargava , director of the medical council , at a news conference on Tuesday . 
This falls in line with what many experts have warned for months -- that India 's coronavirus crisis may be much more dire than official figures suggest . 
There are numerous reasons for this : People simply are not getting tested enough . 
There are sometimes errors in reporting and registering cases . 
Changing government strategies can muddle the numbers and paint a misleading picture of the situation . 
The government began rolling back restrictions in May after a months long lockdown , with ministers turning their attention to reopening the economy and public services . 
But experts , including Bhargava , warn that it 's too soon to relax .
