India â€™s Health Minister Dr . Harsh Vardhan urged people to celebrate upcoming festivals from home as the country topped 7 million confirmed Covid 19 cases . 
In a social media briefing on Sunday , Vardhan warned people to stay away from large congregations and diligently follow the guidelines issued by the government regarding precautions to be taken . 
Vardhan 's comments come ahead of the Hindu festive period beginning with Navaratri , or " nine nights , " on October 17 . 
Also known as Durja Puja , it ends with Dussehra on the tenth day . 
The celebrations coincide with the harvest season and culminate with Diwali , the five day festival of lights celebrating the triumph of good over evil , on November 14 . 
Vardhan warned of the possibility for increased Covid 19 transmission during the approaching winter months . 
" These viruses are known to thrive better in the cold weather and low humidity conditions . 
In view of these , it would not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see increased rates of transmission of the novel coronavirus in the Indian context too , " he said . 
Vardhan also called on citizens to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's nationwide awareness campaign , " Jan Andolan , " ( mass movement ) promoting mask wearing and social distancing .
