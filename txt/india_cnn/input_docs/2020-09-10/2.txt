A private biomedical company in India has paused Phase 3 clinical trials of the Astra Zeneca Covid 19 vaccine developed by Oxford University , according to a statement provided by the company to CNN . 
The Serum Institute of India ( SII ) said Thursday that it had " paused the trial in India until further instructions from the Drugs Controller General of India ( DCGI ) on what to do next . " 
The DCGI heads the government body in charge of approving new drugs and clinical trials in India . 
SII is described on its company website as the world 's largest vaccine manufacturer by the number of doses produced and sold globally . 
The development comes after the drug giant Astra Zeneca said Tuesday that it had paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of unexplained illness in one of the volunteers . 
The trials were taking place at more than a dozen sites in India with more than 1,000 participants , according to a source with knowledge of the trials . 
SII received approval from the Drug Controller General of India on August 3 to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials of the Astra Zeneca Covid 19 vaccine .
