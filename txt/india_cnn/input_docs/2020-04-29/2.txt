A pregnant woman in southern India who went into premature labor had to hold onto a bamboo pole and be carried by villagers across a trench that had been dug to keep coronavirus out . 
Local administrations in two states bordering Andhra Pradesh state have built walls and trenches to prevent cars and people crossing state lines as concerns mount over rising cases of the virus amid a nationwide lockdown . 
Andhra Pradesh has reported at least 1,259 cases , including 31 deaths . 
The pregnant woman , from a remote tribal area of Andhra Pradesh , had been referred to a specialist hospital in neighboring Odisha state , where an ambulance was waiting for her . 
But the trench prevented her from walking across the state border , according to Saikanth Varma , a project officer with the Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare department . 
The Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare department has raised the issue with district officials in Odisha who have told the local body to immediately fill the trench . 
The woman gave birth to a healthy baby and is currently in isolation as a precaution . 
Border walls : At Andhra Pradesh â€™s southern border , three walls ranging from 3 feet to 6 feet high were built along the border with Tamil Nadu state to control traffic amid the lockdown . 
A temporary wall built on Sunday was removed the next day , said Ganesh Shekhar , sub collector of Vellore district in Tamil Nadu . 
The decision to build the walls was taken by local district officials and not by the state government , Shekhar added . 
India lockdown : On March 24 , Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a three week nationwide lockdown , which has since been extended until May 3 . 
Modi is yet to make an official announcement on a further extension . 
Several chief ministers are in favor of an extension following a video conference with Modi on Monday , according to CNN affiliate News 18 .
