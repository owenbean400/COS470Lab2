Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director general of the World Health Organization , on Wednesday said that more cases had been reported to the agency in the last 24 hours than any time since the novel coronavirus outbreak began . 
Those four countries , WHO infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove confirmed to CNN in an email , are : the United States , Russia , Brazil and India . 
It is important to note : There can be delays in reporting at many points in the process , so this single day record does not mean that these 106,000 people were infected , tested or counted in the last 24 hours . 
CNN exclusively relies on Johns Hopkins University for its case and death counts , but the world â€™s preeminent health agency making this announcement today is newsworthy .
