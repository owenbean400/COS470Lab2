The Indian Council of Medical Research has advised all states to discontinue the usage of rapid test kits for the next two days after some of them were revealed to be defective . 
The council is sending teams to validate kits already in use so they can assess which ones are faulty and trace them back to the manufacturers . 
Raman R Gangakhedkar , the head of the council , said positive samples were showing " too much variation " and required investigating . 
The rapid testing kits were deployed in India last week . 
The health ministry has repeatedly said that the kits should be used only for surveillance and to determine epidemiological trends . 
India had tested a total of 462,621 samples from 447,812 individuals as of April 21 , according to the council .
