Some of India ’s most prominent personalities are reaching deep into their pockets to contribute to the country ’s coronavirus relief fund . 
On Saturday , Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the creation of PM CARES , a dedicated national fund to deal with emergency and distress situations -- including the Covid 19 pandemic . 
That 's in addition to the Prime Minister 's National Relief Fund , a pre existing nationwide endowment that was already set up for emergencies . 
Within days of the announcement , millions of dollars have been donated to PM CARES by actors , sports stars and business leaders . 
Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar said on Twitter that he had made a donation equivalent to $ 3.3 million . 
Indian cricketer Suresh Raina donated just over $ 40,000 to the fund and another $ 28,000 to the Disaster Relief Fund for the northern state of Uttar Pradesh . 
Pay TM , India ’s biggest digital payments company , is aiming to contribute over $ 65 million to the fund . 
But some people are still donating to the pre existing Prime Minister 's National Relief Fund . 
The country ’s Vice President and Chairman of the Upper House of Parliament , M . Venkaiah Naidu , donated a month ’s salary . 
Other politicians have also followed his example . 
The Prime Minister ’s National Relief Fund was set up in 1948 under former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru .
