A 40 year old migrant worker in India who was walking to his hometown collapsed and died , according to police . 
India is currently in lockdown in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus , meaning public transport has stopped running and only essential services are operating . 
That has left many of the country 's migrant workers out of work , prompting thousands to leave major cities and head home . 
Ranveer Singh , who worked as a delivery man in New Delhi , was traveling from the capital to his hometown in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday . 
Singh collapsed in Agra ( 134 miles from Delhi ) , but was on his way to the Morena district of Madhya Pradesh ( 179 miles from Delhi ) , according to police officer Arvind Kumar . 
A shopkeeper near the national highway where Singh collapsed gave him tea and something to eat , Kumar said . 
However , Singh was complaining of chest pains and died soon after . 
States ordered to help migrant workers : India 's central government on Sunday issued an order for states to mitigate the economic hardship of migrant workers . 
The order called the movement of laborers across state borders " a violation of the lockdown . " 
It also asked states to provide food and shelter for migrant workers so that they do not leave the state , and asked for those who have already left to be quarantined .
