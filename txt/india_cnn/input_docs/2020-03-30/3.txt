In the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh , $ 81 million has been transferred into the bank accounts of over 2.75 million workers . 
That 's an average of $ 29.45 per worker , although it 's unclear how the money will be shared out . 
For context , $ 29.45 is about the equivalent of seven days of minimum daily wages . 
In India , a flight from New Delhi to Mumbai costs around $ 70 , while a liter ( 34 fluid ounces ) of milk is a little less than $ 1 . 
The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh , Yogi Adityanath , made the announcement at a news conference on Monday . 
He also spoke with some of the workers via video conference to tell them about the bank transfers . 
Adityanath also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi â€™s decision to enforce a 21 day nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus . 
Why workers are getting cash : Last Tuesday , Modi announced that the country was going into lockdown . 
All shops , factories , offices , markets , religious spaces and construction sites are closed . 
Only essential services -- including hospitals and grocery stories -- remain in operation . 
But the shutdown has created a problem for India 's migrant workers , with many of them left without a job or pay . 
Some have attempted to leave India 's major cities . 
Over the weekend , a 40 year old migrant worker died as he attempted to walk 179 miles from New Delhi to his hometown , according to police .
