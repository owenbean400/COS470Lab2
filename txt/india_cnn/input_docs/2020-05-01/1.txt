The first train carrying stranded Indian migrant workers home set out today , as the country prepares to lift its nationwide lockdown . 
The restrictions , which have been in place since March 25 , are set to ease on Sunday . 
Railways , which had been suspended during the lockdown , resumed service for one train this morning , bringing 1,200 migrant workers from southern Telangana state back to their home state of Jharkhand in eastern India . 
They are due to arrive at 11 p.m . local time tonight , said a senior railways official . 
Workers will be screened and a decision to institutionally quarantine them will be taken upon arrival , Kumar added . 
This train journey comes two days after the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order allowing inter state movement for those stranded away from home , including migrant workers , as long as that they are asymptomatic . 
Several states such as Punjab and Maharashtra have asked the central government to send trains to take migrant workers home . 
Based on the success of this first train , further trains may be commissioned , according to Kumar .
