The country recorded 67,151 new Covid 19 cases and 1,059 deaths on Tuesday , the Health Ministry announced on Wednesday . 
That brings the total number of cases registered since the pandemic began to over 3.2 million , including 59,449 deaths , and means nearly half of India 's coronavirus cases have been reported in August alone . 
The South Asian nation has reported over 60,000 new daily cases and more than 800 coronavirus related daily deaths for eight consecutive days . 
India has ramped up its coronavirus testing lately , with over 18 million tests carried out so far in August , according to a CNN tally of data provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research . 
Recovered patients : More than 2.4 million people have recovered from the virus in India , the Health Ministry said . 
In India , not all patients require a test to be considered recovered . 
Patients with mild and moderate symptoms are considered no longer active after 10 days of symptom onset if they meet certain conditions , and a test to confirm that they no longer have the virus is not required . 
However , severe cases can only be discharged after one negative coronavirus test .
