India is introducing a phased re opening of public spaces in some areas and a shortening of the night time curfew , according to India 's Ministry of Homes Affairs . 
The nationwide lockdown in containment zones , however , will be extended to June 30 , but the three phase easing of restrictions elsewhere -- called " Unlock 1 " -- will begin on June 8 . 
Phase one will allow for the re opening of places of worship to the public , along with hotels , restaurants , shopping malls and other hospitality services . 
Prior to that , starting June 1 , restrictions on the inter state and intra state movement of persons and goods will be lifted , unless the state or union territory decides otherwise . 
The curfew prohibiting the movement of individuals between 7 p.m . and 7 a.m . will be shortened to 9 p.m . to 5 a.m . nationwide . 
These decisions come as India recorded 8,380 new confirmed coronavirus cases Sunday , its biggest 24 hour increase to date . 
Educational , training and coaching institutions including schools and colleges will be opened after consultations with states and union territories under phase two . 
Dates for restarting international air travel for passengers , except as permitted by the Ministry of Home Affairs , resuming metro rail services and reopening movie theaters , gyms , swimming pools , entertainment parks , bars , auditoriums , assembly halls and similar places will be decided in phase three . 
No exact dates were provided for the start of phases two and three .
