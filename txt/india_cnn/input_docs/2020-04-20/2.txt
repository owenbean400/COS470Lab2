India has reintroduced a ban on the delivery of non essential items by e commerce companies -- reversing an earlier decision to lift the restriction . 
In an order issued Sunday , the Ministry of Home Affairs said companies such as Amazon and Flipkart would not be allowed to deliver non essential items until May 3 . 
That reverses an earlier relaxation of lockdown restrictions introduced last week -- when the government said e commerce companies could start delivering non essential items . 
Nothing has changed for essential items . 
Since the lockdown was enacted last month , e commerce companies have been allowed to deliver groceries and other essential goods . 
That remains the case .
