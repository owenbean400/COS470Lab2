The Indian government is considering an " emergency authorization " of Covid 19 vaccines , the country 's health minister , Harsh Vardhan , said Sunday . 
Vardhan said that while Phase 3 trials are usually six to nine months long , an emergency authorization could cut that time period . 
" Any emergency authorization is always done by adopting re enforced safeguards so that people need not worry about safety , " he said . 
At present , the Covid 19 vaccines that are at the most advanced stage in clinical trials in India include Covaxin , which is being developed domestically , and vaccines that the Serum Institute of India is collaborating on with Astra Zeneca , Oxford University and Codagenix USA . 
Vardhan said the results of these vaccine trials will be available by the first quarter of 2021 , and there will be efforts to ensure that the vaccines can be manufactured in parallel " so that we do not lose precious time ( in ) providing vaccines to the population . " 
Senior citizens and those working in high risk professions , such as healthcare workers , will be given priority in getting the vaccination , the minister said . 
" No corners will be cut in the clinical trials , and vaccines will be made available only when the government can ensure its safety and efficacy , " Vardhan added . 
India reported 92,071 new Covid 19 cases on Monday , bringing the total to more than 4.8 million . 
There were also another 1,136 deaths , bringing the total death toll to 79,722 .
