More than 2,000 members of the transgender community in India wrote a letter to the government on Saturday , asking for financial assistance during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown . 
The country has been locked down since March 25 , with transportation halted , state borders shut , and businesses suspended . 
This has hit the transgender community hard , said the letter -- many of them rely on sex work or begging for their income , neither of which can be done during the lockdown . 
The letter asked for " an assured subsistence income of at least 3000 rupees ( close to $ 40 ) per month to every transgender person across the country , " as well as supplies of food and medicine , and protection against eviction . 
The National Institute of Social Defense provided an interim relief of 1,500 rupees ( about $ 20 ) to 4,500 transgender people after a previous request from members of the community . 
However , the letter said that this relief does not even cover monthly necessities , and that it was provided to less than 1 % of the transgender people in the country .
