Two people , including a police officer , were injured after a protest by migrant workers turned violent in the Indian city of Hyderabad yesterday . 
The protests started after a construction company asked its workers to resume work on Wednesday . 
The workers refused , saying they had not been paid since March and they wanted to go home , said Chandrashekhar Reddy , a senior police official in Telangana state , where Hyderabad is the capital . 
Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers work for daily wages at construction sites across the country . 
The Indian government has issued exemptions to certain industries to resume work over the past two weeks , amid a nationwide lockdown that is in place through May 3 . 
The police de escalated the situation and took the migrant workers to a district official , said Reddy . 
After the construction company agreed to pay the money owed to the workers , the crowd dispersed . 
Telangana has reported at least 1,012 coronavirus cases and 26 deaths , according to India 's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare .
