A woman in the southern Indian state of Telangana rode 900 miles ( 1,448 kilometers ) on a two wheeler scooter , over two days and nights , to bring her son home during a national lockdown . 
Razia Begum , 48 , is the principal at a government school in the town of Bodhan . 
Her 19 year old son had gone to the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh in late March , traveling with a friend who had to take an exam there . 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a 21 day coronavirus lockdown on March 25 , which went into effect across the country just hours after his announcement -- and Begum 's son was stranded . 
" He was living at a dargah ( mausoleum ) there because he could not come back , so I decided to bring him back . 
Since four wheelers are not allowed I just took my scooter , " Begum told CNN . 
After getting permission from the commissioner of police , she set out on her journey on Monday , taking short breaks every few hours . 
She and her son were back home by Wednesday . 
Begum is a single parent of two sons and a daughter . 
Her husband passed away 15 years ago , so she had been managing the household since . 
The nationwide lockdown ends on April 15 . 
However the states of Punjab and Odisha have already extended their lockdowns through to April 30 .
