A village in the southern state of Kerala is distributing 10,000 umbrellas to residents to help maintain social distancing , according to a senior local council official . 
The idea is to stand next to one another with open umbrellas to maintain a distance of at least a meter , Jyothi added . 
Along with umbrellas , two masks each will also be distributed to citizens . 
Women 's neighborhood groups will stitch 100,000 masks under the Kudumbashree initiative in Kerala . 
The initiative , which mobilizes community groups , was launched under the Kerala state poverty mission to empower women but is being repurposed to fight coronavirus at a local level , according to Jyothi . 
The state has used several innovative measures to help contain the spread of coronavirus and trace infected patients . 
Walk in kiosks were installed in a district in Kerala to facilitate sample collection earlier this month , and a robot is being used in a Kerala hospital to dispense medicines and food to patients in isolation wards to reduce human contact . 
Kerala was the first state in India to report cases of the coronavirus . 
The state currently has 458 cases of coronavirus including 4 deaths . 
India has a total of 27,892 cases of the coronavirus , including 872 deaths , according to the Indian Ministry of Health .
