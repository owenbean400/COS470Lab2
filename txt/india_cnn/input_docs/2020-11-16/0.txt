India reported 30,548 new coronavirus cases for the past 24 hours on Monday , the lowest single day rise since July 15 , according to a CNN tally of data from the Indian Ministry of Health . 
Monday also marks the ninth consecutive day that new infections have fallen below 50,000 . 
That 's despite the celebrations and gatherings for Diwali -- the festival of lights that fell on November 14 this year . 
The Health Ministry attributed the declining new cases to the " successful dissemination of Covid Appropriate Behaviour among the varied population groups " . 
However , as people gathered to shop ahead of Diwali , experts warned India may see an uptick in cases in the following weeks . 
As of Monday , India 's total caseload stands at 8,845,127 , with 130,070 deaths .
