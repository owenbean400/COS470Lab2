Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a reduction in local lockdowns in order to help the wider economy during an online meeting with state leaders on Wednesday . 
In India , state governments are empowered to go beyond the restrictions issued by the federal government and as cases have continued to stack up across various parts of the country , chief ministers have announced partial lockdowns . 
Local police in the city of Mumbai announced a partial lockdown last week , with movement in containment zones -- sections of the city identified as coronavirus hotspots -- prohibited except for essential activities . 
Modi asked state chief ministers to reconsider state or city lockdowns , which are hampering economic activity . 
India has recorded over 5.7 million Covid 19 cases , including 91,149 deaths since the start of the pandemic , the worst hit country after the United States .
