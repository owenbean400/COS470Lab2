Thousands of migrant workers are attempting to leave India 's major cities after a nationwide total lockdown left them without jobs or pay . 
The potential mass migration may undermine attempts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's government to prevent the localized spread of the coronavirus , with some workers even attempting to make the journey on foot , due to widespread closures of public transport . 
Migration of labor : According to government statistics , every year more than nine million migrant workers move from India 's rural areas to large population centers to find work at construction sites or factories , sending money back to their home towns and villages . 
But with those industries closed by the government lockdown , many have been left with little choice but to attempt the return journey home . 
Migrant worker Bablu Ehrewal , 24 , used to work at a mall construction site earning $ 7 a day ( 500 rupees ) . 
Construction stopped this week when the lockdown came into effect . 
Now he is stuck in a slum with 70 other migrant construction workers in the state of Madhya Pradesh and has not been paid in 20 days . 
Without money , he ca not afford food , and with the trains shut , his only option may be to walk home .
