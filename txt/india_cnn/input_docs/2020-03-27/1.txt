Foreign citizens in India have found themselves stranded after the government declared a complete nationwide lockdown on Wednesday . 
The lockdown is in place across all of India 's 36 states and territories , home to 1.3 billion people . 
Ryan Birch , a 28 year old American from New York , is now stuck in the Indian state of Goa , along with other friends from the US and UK . 
" I am very concerned about what is happening here , " he told CNN . 
He had already been living under state imposed curfew , which prohibited them from leaving their accommodations during certain hours , said Birch . 
Then news of the lockdown came during curfew hours -- leaving him unable to go out and buy the necessary food and supplies . 
Now , authorities are sending mixed messages , feeding confusion and anxiety . 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said essential stores would be open for food and medicine , but the Goa minister had told the state 's citizens that all stores would be closed , said Birch . 
Birch said he had reached out to the US embassy in Mumbai , but they had not been very helpful in figuring out what to do next either . 
" It 's all a mess , " he added .
