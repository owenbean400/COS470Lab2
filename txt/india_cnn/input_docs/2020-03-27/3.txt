Liz Lord , an American citizen from Maryland , was on a bus traveling in India when Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a complete nationwide lockdown on Wednesday . 
After scrambling to find transportation , she made it back to the Indian capital New Delhi through 30 hours on taxis and buses . 
Once there , she had less than 6 hours to find a flight out of the country due to the new international travel suspensions . 
But she has found herself stranded yet again today , with her flight canceled and no communication from the airline . 
She said she has tried to reach out to anybody who can help -- the US embassy , Maryland officials , even speaking out on social media and to news outlets . 
" We do want to come home , and many of us are willing to go through any medical exam or home quarantine that is necessary ... rather than having to wait three weeks , " she said .
