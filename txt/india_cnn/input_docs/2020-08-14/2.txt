The Indian Medical Association has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing the " rising concerns of safety of doctors during this Covid crisis , " saying that almost 200 doctors have died across the country because of the virus . 
" Increasing number of doctors are getting infected and losing lives due to Covid . 
Substantial number of them are General Practitioners , " said the letter , dated August 7 and signed by the IMA 's national president and honorary secretary general . 
According to the IMA , 196 doctors across India have died because of the coronavirus as of August 7 . 
The southern state of Tamil Nadu has seen the highest proportion of doctor deaths at 43 . 
The western states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have the second highest with 23 doctors dying in each state , according to data from the IMA . 
The letter added that Covid 19 does not discriminate between the government and private sector and that a lot of general practitioners had died due to the coronavirus as they provide treatment for patients who consult them for fever and related symptoms on a daily basis . 
The association is calling on the government to ensure adequate care for doctors and their families , who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus , and to provide sponsored medical and life insurance facilities to doctors in all sectors .
