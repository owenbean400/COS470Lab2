As countries impose greater restrictions on travel and flights , it 's becoming increasingly hard for some travelers to make their way back home . 
Indian national Jaskeerat Singh Bakshi is studying medicine in the Philippines capital of Manila . 
On Monday , the Philippines locked down its largest and most populous island of Luzon -- home to more than 50 million people , including the capital -- in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus . 
Foreign nationals were told they had a 72 hour window to voluntarily leave the country . 
" This pushed everybody into panic , most of all the students who comprise the large majority of Indians there , " Bakshi told CNN . 
Bakshi said he got on an early flight the next day to Kolkata with a stop over in Malaysia 's capital Kuala Lumpur . 
But mid journey India issued new travel guidelines prohibiting flights entering the country from Afghanistan , Malaysia and Philippines with immediate effect . 
And Malaysia had that day issued tough restrictions prohibiting any foreign nationals from entering the country . 
" This leaves us with nowhere to go . 
Our connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to India was canceled , " he said . 
" Neither the Malaysian authorities will accept us nor is there any other way to get to India . " 
He and 250 other Indian nationals were left stranded overnight in the airport . 
By Wednesday , Bakshi has received good news . 
The Indian High Commission in Malaysia and India â€™s Foreign Affairs Ministry had got involved and said they had secured flights to bring the stranded travelers back home .
